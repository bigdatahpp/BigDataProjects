Now I will hand the call over to Acorns CEO Jan Loeb. Jan,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Thank you Tracy and good morning to those joining our call. Id like to start today by saying that I am very proud of the OmniMetrix team and grateful for how they rose to the challenges we faced over the past year.,ACFN,0.999045729637146,0.9980914505717735,Positive
Despite significant business challenges posed by COVID19 Acorn was able to achieve profitability on a net income basis in the fourth quarter and positive cash flow for the quarter and full year. These are very significant milestones for our company and ones that we have been working toward for several years. Whats even more important is that we believe Acorn is on track to achieve profitability and positive cash flow on a consolidated basis for the full year 2021 and moving forward.,ACFN,0.9746937751770021,0.9493873195725651,Positive
This is particularly significant for Acorn because we have nearly 70 million of net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs. These NOLs will shelter our future net income from federal taxes for the foreseeable future positively impacting our operating cash flow and benefiting our future cash balances and financial positioning. Further we no longer have any debt as we paid off our line of credit last month. What this means for our shareholders is we now have a growing cashgenerating and selffunding business with attractive margins and recurring revenue streams. This should make our public equity more attractive to a broader base of investors and puts us in a stronger position to pursue valueenhancing investments and opportunities.,ACFN,0.9999955892562866,0.9999911784723492,Positive
Importantly throughout 2020 and the ongoing spread of the pandemic we were able to remain fully operational without any employee furloughs. We did however experience an interruption in all business development dialogues particularly within our Corrosion Protection or CP business as prospective customers halted procurement discussions and inperson sales meetings. Nevertheless the strength of our value proposition and business model enabled Acorn to achieve yearoveryear GAAP revenue growth in 2020 and to maintain our cash basis sales at 2019 levels.,ACFN,0.9046530723571776,0.8093052751930683,Positive
We also further improved our gross margins to 69.8 in 2020 versus 65  65.4 in 2019 reflecting an improvement in hardware margins and an increase in highermargin monitoring revenue as a percentage of total revenue. In addition the personal challenges we all faced with the spread of COVID some also faced the unpredictable damaging impacts of mother nature 2020 and the beginning of 2021 has been another period of severe weather patterns from wildfires in California to extreme cold in Texas. Severe weather continues to disrupt and expose the national problem of aging power grids. This increasing incidence of power outages is a driver of backup generator power installations even in places that historically have not been large markets for us.,ACFN,4.559755325317383e-06,-1.0,Negative
California for example has not historically been a big market for generators which may now be a big market opportunity for generator OEMs thereby growing the base of potential endpoints to offer our monitoring and control products and services. These trends combined with the very limited penetration of backup generator monitoring in both commercial industrial and consumer settings as well as the growing base of people who work remotely are important demand drivers underlying our longterm growth outlook. It is estimated that as little as 15 of backup power generators are currently monitored which support our longterm growth yield.,ACFN,0.9997547268867492,0.9995094515367173,Positive
In the near term we believe we have a strong foundation upon which to achieve further top line and bottom line growth in fiscal 2021. As business conditions gradually return to a more normalized state particularly in our dialogues with natural gas pipeline operators. In the latter part of 2020 we were able to begin reengaging in sales dialogues with large companies and we are working to build on that activity this year.,ACFN,0.02102041244506836,-0.9579681029653476,Negative
To that end we recently added a new sales engineer to support business development efforts in our pipeline Corrosion Protection segment so that we were able to adequately support an expected increase in business development efforts. We also added an additional sales engineer in our larger power generation segment to support expected growth from our focus on the commercial and industrial market segments.,ACFN,0.8335624933242798,0.6671234688130239,Positive
Our growth prospects are also driven by OmniMetrix cuttingedge technology and solutions and our ongoing investment in new product development and innovation. During 2020 we launched our new Smart Annunciator solution which revolutionize circuit annunciator monitoring by refining a 5inch touchscreen LCD display on the device which combined with our remote monitoring technology provides realtime SaaS and lower missioncritical circuitry.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
In late 2020 we also upgraded and launched our nextgeneration OmniPro data management software used in our pipeline Corrosion Protection solutions. This software builds upon our product capabilities to enhance the value and effectiveness of our Hero2 Rectifier Monitor and our Patriot test station monitors while also relying customers to import non OmniMetrix data. This valueadded solution solves a key pain point for our pipeline customers by enabling the centralized tracking of critical data and assets on a hardware agnostic basis.,ACFN,0.9846566915512084,0.969313243178314,Positive
We are excited to be reengaging with customer prospects regarding this important new solution. We are also focused on adding sales support behind our AirGuard air compressor monitoring solution which is still in its early stages of commercialization having been first launched in 2019. And in order to deliver greater value to our customers and maintain our technology leadership position in the remote monitoring marketplace. We plan to continue our investments in RD and new product development and we expect to launch additional product enhancements and new products this year.,ACFN,0.9999115467071532,0.9998230926076519,Positive
Turning back to our financials Acron was successful in substantially strengthening our financial position in 2020 increasing cash by 816000 to over 2 million at yearend reflecting 464000 in operating cash flow and net Paycheck Protection Program loan proceeds of 421000 partially offset by investments in software and new products.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Our strength in the balance sheet provides a solid foundation to support organic growth as well as partnerships or possible tuckin acquisitions of a technology or product that would strengthen our remote monitoring solutions portfolio. In any scenario we would closely evaluate any opportunity to ensure that it meets our criteria of being accretive to earnings cash flow and shareholder value either immediately or certainly within a reasonable period of time.,ACFN,0.9990006089210509,0.9980012087281027,Positive
Having forged a strategy that focused Acorns future on the potential of our OmniMetrix business we have been extremely pleased by its performance and resiliency particularly over the past year. We believe this strength is due to the value return on investment and even the environmental benefits that remote monitoring solutions deliver versus resourceintensive physical inspection and the significant limits of periodic onsite evaluations.,ACFN,0.9382534623146056,0.8765063615284356,Positive
Our clear value proposition combined with continued low levels of penetration for remote monitoring and IoT services in commercial and industrial markets continue to suggest there remains substantial longterm growth opportunities for our business. As our economy stabilizes and as our larger pipeline of industrial customers get back to normal procurement dialogue cycles we believe Acorn is poised to aggressively execute and growth opportunities across our expanding base of solutions.,ACFN,0.9976720809936525,0.9953441407577259,Positive
All of the reasons Ive highlighted our Board and management and team remain confident in the potential for Acorn to achieve an annual growth trajectory of at least 20 in 2021 and for years to come while also maintaining positive operating cash flow and achieving profitability on an annual basis. Given the opportunities we have identified our strong capital position our knowledge and experienced team and the tangible value we provide to our customers I am very enthusiastic about our business and about our prospects going forward.,ACFN,0.9985921382904052,0.9971842637417418,Positive
We also think we are in somewhat of a sweet spot with the new administration in Washington firstly because of our clean tech business model and the expected renewed focus on environmental issues in green policy incentives and secondly our large NOL position could become an even more valuable asset corporate tax rates were to be increased. With that overview Ill turn the call back to Tracy Clifford our CFO to review our financials in greater detail.,ACFN,0.9340127110481262,0.868024820321724,Positive
Thanks Jan. This morning we released our 2020 fourth quarter and yearend results in a press release and also filed our 2020 10K with the SEC. Ill review some financial highlights compared to the comparable fourth quarter and full year of 2019. OmniMetrix revenue grew 8 to 5.9 million in 2020 from 5.5 million in 2019 due to a 15 increase in monitoring revenue. This was offset by a 3 decrease in hardware revenue.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Monitoring growth reflects an increase in the number of units being monitored while the decline in hardware sales reflects business development disruptions caused by COVID19 particularly in our Corrosion Protection segment. Revenue in Q4 2020 was 14 higher than Q41 2019 as a result of increases in both monitoring and hardware revenue. In accordance with GAAP hardware sales are deferred and recognized to revenue over the estimated life of the unit which is three years thus 2020 revenue on a GAAP basis includes amortization of hardware sales made in 2020 as well as in the prior two years when we enjoyed strong sales increases.,ACFN,0.9864776134490968,0.9729551035800832,Positive
Gross profit grew 15 to 4.1 million in 2020 with a higher percentage of revenue coming from monitoring which is a higher gross margin and also due to a favorable change in the product mix of hardware. Gross margin on hardware increased to 44 in 2020 from 38 in 2019 reflecting a more costefficient product mix in the Corrosion Protection segment as well as to reduce cost on new power generation products.,ACFN,0.9592939019203186,0.9185874326192496,Positive
Gross margin on monitoring revenue remained strong at 84 in both 2020 and 2019. In quarter four 2020 gross profit grew 17 over quarter four 2019 to 1.1 million and gross margin increased 1 to 69 from 68 in Q4 2019.,ACFN,0.11461615562438965,-0.7707757630554363,Negative
OmniMetrix total operating expense increased 4 to 3.6 million in 2020 primarily due to an 11 increase in research and development expense and a 3 increase in SGA expenses. This increase in RD was for continued development of nextgeneration products as well as potential new product lines. In Q4 OmniMetrixs operating expenses increased 4 to 888000 as compared to the prior year quarter.,ACFN,0.7581663131713867,0.5163304209278345,Positive
OmniMetrixs operating income increased to 580000 in fiscal 2020 versus operating income of 177000 in the prior year period principally due to increased revenue and higher gross margin offset by slightly higher operating expenses. In Q4 OmniMetrix operating income increased to 222000 compared to 89000 in Q4 2019 attributed to the same drivers as the annual increases.,ACFN,0.07740861177444458,-0.845191190071466,Negative
Acorns corporate SGA costs increased 2 to 890000 from 876000 for the full year 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 8 213000 from 197000 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 both the increased full year and the fourth quarter increase was due to higher professional fees. Acorn recognized a gain of 421000 in 4Q 2020 and the full year 2020 on the forgiveness of OmniMetrixs Paycheck Protection Program loan.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Including the gain net income attributable to Acorn shareholders improved to 69000 or zero cents per share in 2020 as compared to a net loss of 618000 or 0.02 loss per share in 2019. Q4 2020 net income attributable to shareholders improved to 417000 or 0.01 per share from a net loss of 61000 or zero cents per share in Q4 2019. Excluding the Paycheck Protection Program gain Acorn would have recorded consolidated Q4 net income before noncontrolling interest of 2000.,ACFN,0.22509628534317014,-0.5498144960885616,Negative
As you may know Acorn uses cash basis sales as a performance measure to supplement our GAAP revenue growth trends. Cash basis sales differ from GAAP revenue because we differ and recognize revenue from hardware sales over a threeyear period. And we defer and recognize revenue from monitoring contracts over the period of service which is typically oneyear. We invoice upon hardware shipment or monitoring renewal and our terms are typically 30days.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Cash sales are typically greater than GAAP revenue during periods expansion when we are able to be active in new business generation. Given the impact of COVID19 on our pace of new hardware sales during 2020 our full year cash sales only modestly exceeded GAAP revenue in the same period which we view as a positive outcome. For the full year our cash basis sales has held steady at 6 million in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.,ACFN,0.9911865592002868,0.9823730380259397,Positive
Cash sales were also flat for the second half of 2020 versus the second half of 2019. In Q4 our cash basis sales were 1517000 versus 1557000 in Q4 2019. Were encouraged that were able to maintain our cash sales throughout 2020 at 2019 levels despite the impact of the pandemic. And we do expect that cash basis sales will once again exceed GAAP revenue as the impact of the pandemic recedes and we return to more normal business practices and sales trends in 2021.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
As it relates to cash sales across our two segments comparing fiscal 2020 to 2019 cash basis sales increased by 169000 to 5.2 million in our power generation segment. While our CP segment declined 162000 to 807000.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Cash generated from operating activities improved to 464000 in 2020 including 164000 generated in 4Q.,ACFN,0.19894862174987796,-0.6021100617301298,Negative
At yearend 2020 consolidated cash increased to 2.1 million from 1.2 million at December 2019. The increase of 816000 is due to cash generated from operating activities plus the PPP net proceeds offset by some investments in software and development.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
OmniMetrixs outstanding balance on its credit line was 149000 as of December 31 2021. And as Jan previously mentioned we paid this line off in full in February. And given the strength of our consolidated balance sheet we elected not to renew the line and wed let it expire on February 28 in accordance with its terms. We believe the companys current cash and expected cashflow from operations provides sufficient liquidity to finance the companys existing operations into the foreseeable future.,ACFN,0.9490562081336976,0.8981119516828244,Positive
That concludes my remarks. And now Ill turn the call over to the operator and give you an all an opportunity to ask any questions you may have. Operator,ACFN,0.8178726434707642,0.6357436260215872,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
We will now begin the questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions The first question comes from Richard Sosa who is a private investor. Please go ahead.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Hi Jan how are you doing,ACFN,0.9863808155059814,0.9727615068110984,Positive
Good morning Richard.,ACFN,0.966176211833954,0.9323521152101051,Positive
First of all congratulations. As you know Ive held this stuff for what seems like over 10 of my life. So congratulations on your first quarter profit on an operating basis and the cashflow basis. Youve been talking about this for many years and its been a long road and its great to finally see it. So definitely congratulations to you and your entire team.,ACFN,0.9999998807907104,0.9999997615803338,Positive
Thank you.,ACFN,0.966345489025116,0.9326906711361611,Positive
So I had two questions. The last year you had talked a little bit about a slowdown in the industrial markets and both of your end markets have you seen any kind of pickup in the first quarter specifically on the generator side,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
The slowdown that you are referring to in the commercial and industrial side is really from the OEM side. So for example Generac has said that their commercial industrial side generated sales has slowed because their residential side has picked up and has been growing very significantly. We have not seen a drop in the commercial industrial side because that has been our focus like the residential side has a very low penetration rate.,ACFN,0.1796979308128357,-0.6406116191618958,Negative
So our focus is commercial and industrial. And since thats our focus weve seen consistent growth in that area. The residential side of our businesses were not so focused because there is significant competition from the OEMs on the residential side. That business has been growing for the OEMs but from our standpoint our focus is commercial and industrial and that continues to grow very nicely for us.,ACFN,0.9809187650680542,0.9618373561237898,Positive
And you talked a little bit about the new administration and a new potential friendly administration. It makes a lot of sense you have a democratic administration. It would make sense that OmniMetrix is a darling in their eyes helps companies be more efficient helps generators be more efficient helps pipelines be more efficient all of that is very good. Have you heard anything specific to like a specific policy that could benefit OmniMetrix,ACFN,0.9999969005584716,0.9999938010886775,Positive
Weve not heard yet of any specific policies. But just in general were saying since green is going to be a focus and the administration has said its going to be a focus and going to zero emissions so remote monitoring is certainly an area that allows companies to do that but you get closer to that goal. So we think were in the right spot. But weve not seen or heard any direct policies that would impact us today.,ACFN,0.9934529662132264,0.9869058727204363,Positive
Thats great. I do have one more question but Ill go back in the queue and let anyone go if theres somebody there.,ACFN,0.955696702003479,0.9113929999807178,Positive
We actually dont have anybody in the question queue currently Richard if youd like to ask your next question.,ACFN,0.0308416485786438,-0.9383255411329208,Negative
Oh thats great. Sure. So I noticed you did a presentation with Roche in December and I see that you are attending a conference virtual conference this week later this week with Maxim I believe is this something you plan to do over next few months to be I mean youve done a great job telling your story obviously. But are you going to do more of these and get in front of new investors,ACFN,0.9999737739562988,0.9999475476734279,Positive
If were invited it certainly would be hope that I can do that. I think our story  I think weve reached a milestone which weve tried as you noted before is to get to profitability on a consolidated basis. And I think that now that weve reached that milestone our next milestone is to show that we have significant growth potential and the profitability that that growth can bring. As you know we have a 70 gross profit margin on our business. So as our gross ramps up the profitability story becomes a very large one. And so I hope to bring focus to that over the next year or so. And conferences will help me accomplish that.,ACFN,0.9999435544013976,0.9998871082880365,Positive
Thats great Jan. Congratulations. And I look forward to your continued success at AcornOmniMetrix.,ACFN,0.9985027313232422,0.9970054489920646,Positive
Thank you Richard.,ACFN,0.9314355850219728,0.8628705447671818,Positive
The next question comes from Peter Rabover with Artko Capital. Please go ahead.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Hey Jan congratulations on reaching profitability and cash flow positive. I wanted to get some questions on the metrics for the hardware. The relationship between the hardware and the recurring revenue. And so I think Tracy might have said it but what were the hardware sales this quarter 650000 or something Am I correct on that or,ACFN,0.999792218208313,0.999584434521749,Positive
Tracy Tracy you want to handle that,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Tracy this is the operator your line might be muted if youre speaking we cannot hear you.,ACFN,0.19672644138336184,-0.6065544427284519,Negative
Yes. Im sorry. Im sorry Peter could you repeat your question,ACFN,0.0006470680236816406,-0.9987149776038996,Negative
What were the hardware,ACFN,0.7737692594528198,0.5475364557825844,Positive
Is it hardware sale or hardware cash sale,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Yes I guess  I guess an increase in deferred revenue what are the metrics you guys use to track hardware sales,ACFN,0.9130197167396544,0.8260386402580724,Positive
Sure. We typically use metrics across our product lines as well because the gross margin differs by product. As it relates to cash sales compared to the hardware sales as I was stating the hardware is amortized over three years of hardware sales or actually amortized over three years. So the cash that is the difference between the cash sales metric and the actual GAAP revenue that we recognized. So theres actually three years of amortized sales coming into the GAAP revenue on a monthly basis. So that kind of explains the difference. As our hardware sales increase of course the layers of GAAP revenue that are amortized in will also increase.,ACFN,0.9769123792648317,0.9538245479809,Positive
Right. So Im sorry but what was the number of both the GAAP,ACFN,0.12316969037055968,-0.7536686155586892,Negative
Our full consolidated sales across  I dont believe I gave hardware sales separately on the cash basis. Our full hardware sales and monitoring sales for cash basis were 6 million in both 2020 and 2019.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Sorry I was asking for the quarter what were the hardware sales for the quarter,ACFN,0.2135460078716278,-0.5729151563650049,Negative
Let me just pull that for you. Give me just a moment.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Okay. Let me ask this question. So while she is looking I guess do you guys have kind of a good idea on  and I think I sort of did it in the past but I dont want to send this number without  doesnt come out and correct but for every x amount of dollars of hardware sales whether cash or GAAP what is your monitoring revenue base increased by,ACFN,0.9967646598815918,0.9935292902583304,Positive
You cant really use that number because our hardware sales for example rectifier sale is about well call it 1800 a unit and the generator monitor sale is maybe 300 a unit. So you just cant say each dollar youd have to you look at the units.,ACFN,0.8325284719467163,0.6650554166280849,Positive
Okay.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Not units in total versus a volume  volume sales number.,ACFN,0.5,-4.559776116797032e-06,Negative
Okay. Do you have an ARR number for the monitoring revenue,ACFN,0.7964128255844116,0.5928237945449522,Positive
So you could say kind of on average for every unit we sell its approximately 150 a year in monitoring revenue on average.,ACFN,0.9600929021835328,0.9201854404322025,Positive
Right. Do you have like an average hardware  I mean I guess Im just trying to get better metrics to kind of highlight the value of the company in terms of given your high renewal rate so an increase in hardware which I think was like 400000 or 500000 for the last  for 2020 which was clearly a down year. Sounds like fourth quarter was at least 600000 700000. Just trying to get gauge what the ARR base for the monitoring revenue which is like the  which is what really drives the gross margins the gross profits and the value of the company,ACFN,0.99583637714386,0.9916727163173438,Positive

I guess my second question would be what the  you guys are you have 2 million in cashflow you are cashflow positive. And I guess I know its a small amount like 2 million on a  but the market cap is not that big. So Im just curious what your plans with the cash flow going forward are,ACFN,0.9596107006072998,0.9192210328822741,Positive
So we would use it to support our growth number one. I mean obviously weve said in our remarks that we expect the least 20 growth in revenue in 2021 and beyond. So well need some working capital increases inventory receivables et cetera. So as we hopefully ramp up our growth I would say that the cash right now would be used to support the growth of the company.,ACFN,0.9996199011802672,0.9992397988942034,Positive
