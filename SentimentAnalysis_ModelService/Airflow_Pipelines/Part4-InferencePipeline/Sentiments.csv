Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Centamin 2020 Results Presentation. My name is Ruby and I will be your moderator for todays call. Operator Instructions,Positive
I will now hand over to your host Martin Horgan CEO to begin. Martin please go ahead.,Positive
Thank you very much Ruby and good afternoon everybody and welcome to our 2020 results presentation. As mentioned Im Martin Horgan Chief Executive Officer. And Im joined today by my colleague Ross Jerrard who is Chief Financial Officer and Alexandra Carse who is Head of Corporate Communication. Ross is going to take you through our 2020 results in some detail and then Ill update you around some of our new and exciting news regarding our updated mine planning and exploration at Sukari. Well then finish with a QA and then Ross and I will be happy to take any questions you may have.,Positive
Ill go into my first anniversary as a CEO of Centamin and I honestly say its been quite a year. Id say its been a year of challenges all across many firms. I think its one that we faced head on and I think with a growing sense of confidence. I think looking back at 2020 its going to be viewed as a pivotal year for Centamin. I think one that has put us in a much better position for the future. I said at our Capital Markets Day presentation in December one of the things I was most pleased about when I joined was the quality of the team here and I can say theyve performed incredibly well over 2020. In the face of the unique operating environment they have delivered what was required and quite a bit more. Im also pleased with the way the speed at which the new team members have integrated into the company. Selectively as a Group they have started to make some really positive changes in how we operate the business.,Positive
In October we revised guidance due to minor geotechnical issue in the open pit and this was compounded by a lack of mining flexibility. Regarding was a clear disappointment to the market and obviously growth. Improving operating flexibility is key for us and perhaps to say progress is already being made. We started an accelerated wastestripping program back at the end of last year and that was utilizing our own operated fleet. That led to a record amount of dirt being moved and we recorded the highest total material moved to the mines history. Weve also introduced the mining pit  open pit contractor to accelerate the wastestripping and this will provide better mining flexibility as we invest in Sukari to ensure were able to meet our longterm goals and the same situation applies in the underground. Were seeking to ensure we have more steps available to provide enough mining and operational flexibility.,Positive
I think its important to recognize that in the midst that wasnt a function of poor performance by our operational side thing as Ive said our teams performed incredibly well over the last year by any standard let alone one that was impacted most severely by COVID. Working within a longterm planning framework of no doubt that the SGM team can deliver our vision for Sukari. And by continued building on our knowledge of the geological framework at Sukari which will improve our models and support our more confident longterm planning. As a result of this weve already identified a number of new exploration opportunities to grow our resource base beyond the current life of mine and were going to discuss that a little bit later on.,Positive
In terms of the operations as I said Im looking forward to updating you on a new and improved strategy for the management of the Sukari orebody and this has led to a change in the open pit and underground mine design. And by implementing this approach that results in a more optimized open pit mining plan which not only increases and enhances the value of the open pit but also reduces the operating risk as well. And our optimized open pit as a result of a longterm mine schedule which we think is strategic with respect to value its practical with respect to the mining shape and the pit stop requirement and its achievable with respect to the mining equipment fleet we have and the ore processing capacity.,Positive
Away from Egypt we made some excellent progress in assessing West Africa. That work is close to completion now. And Im very much looking forward to updating you in the next month as we continue this work and we start to map out the next steps as we seek to realize value from our West African portfolio.,Positive
And speaking of growth we continue to discuss the bid round with our partners in Egypt. And I hope that we can complete these discussions and get a highly capable team on the ground and into the field to start really exploring that huge potential of the Arabian Nubian Shield in Egypt.,Positive
Over 2020 our sector benefited from improved commodity prices better gold prices lower fuel prices. In addition to this Centamin continued to realize a number of costsaving initiatives which helped to drive strong free cash flows which underpinned our commitment to dividend pay. This one  Russ will take you through the detail of this shortly.,Positive
Back in December we mapped out our clear reset plans for unlocking the full potential of Sukari. We start 2021 stronger with a clear vision and a sense of confidence and excitement. We want to rebuild that market confidence in Centamins delivery but also the value that sits within the company. And we hope with a clear plan and deliveries results well be able to do just that.,Positive
As weve all faced the global challenge of COVID Im really proud of the way that Centamin and the team responded. It was fast comprehensive and nimble thinking aligned with the hard work and the commitment above and beyond the normal course of business by our team that allowed us to do this. We navigated the crisis without any material disruptions to our operations Im pleased to say. Weve also sought to support our local communities and help them navigate COVID and weve completed a number of initiatives in this regard both in Egypt and West Africa.,Positive
On watching how the team responded to COVID further underlines my sense of confidence that I have that weve got the ability and the resolve within Centamin to deliver the company that we believe we can should be. But COVID is not yet behind us and we continue to treat this really seriously. Weve assumed that COVID could be with us for the foreseeable future. Weve adapted our operating processes and procedures accordingly. This allows us to take a constructive and proactive approach to our daytoday operations our longerterm planning and particularly our capital projects involving thirdparty contractors.,Positive
I believe we have a resilient approach to COVID and to use the old expression were prepared for the worst but were hoping for the best.,Positive
In terms of operational safety it remains a clear and primary focus for management. Everybody who comes to work should get to go home safely. This years safety record is evidence of continued progress. We had a 41 improvement in the lost time injury frequency rate down to 0.84 million hours worked and a total recorded injury frequency rate of 5.16 per million hours worked. Its an improvement but its not where we need it to be where we want it to be. And this is going to continue to be an ongoing focus for us as we roll into 21 and beyond.,Positive
And with that Id now like to hand you over to Ross who is going to take you through our financial performance for 2020 and mark progress against those key initiatives.,Positive
Thank you Martin. It is my pleasure to present our 2020 results. Centamin is a financially robust highly cashgenerative business committed to responsible mining and balanced stakeholder returns. Our financial strategy remains consistent. And while it was tested this past year with the challenges faced from COVID19 it demonstrated the strength and resilience of our business.,Positive
Revenues increased by 27 to 829 million from annual gold sales of 468000 ounces down 0.3 but had an increased average realized gold price of 1766 per ounce which was up 27 yearonyear. Underlying EBITDA improved 54 to 439 million at a 53 EBITDA margin principally driven by higher gold prices but also lower costs. CapEx was up 42 yearonyear at 138 million and was in line with what we had forecast for the year after deferrals from COVID. Our capital expenditure was predominantly invested in the projects focused on longterm sustainability of the business.,Negative
Importantly adjusted free cash flow improved by 91 to 142 million which is a key driver and component of our dividend policy resulting in a dividend per share of 0.09 for the year. Please remember that we also had a first interim dividend distribution of 0.06 attributable to 2019 which is a direct replacement of the 2019 bylaw so our total distributions actually amounted to 173 million or 0.15 per share.,Positive
Please refer to the financials for further detail.,Negative
Sometimes it feels quite competitive when we say this but Centamin continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with cash and liquid assets of 310 million as of 31st of December 2020 after free cash flow generated for the year of 142 million and outflows primarily in the form of dividends. Unique amongst our peers Centamin has never had debt hedging or streaming in place. We are therefore able to maximize the strength and flexibility of the balance sheet and offer shareholders gold exposure throughout the cycle. Undeniably our balance sheet is our strength.,Positive
Dividends are central to our strategy. In December 2020 we expressed our intention to pay a US0.03 final dividend and today we have delivered on that promise. This marks the seventh consecutive year of dividend distribution. To us this is demonstration of a good sustainable dividend policy.,Positive
Centamins business model is built around the responsible maximization of free cash flow and our dividend policy is a direct function of that free cash flow generation. The proposed US0.03 per share or 35 million brings the total dividend attributable to 2020 to US0.09 per share or 104 million. In other words US222 per ounce sold in 2020 is returned to shareholders which puts Centamin in the top quartile amongst our peers. This is a proposed dividend and is subject to shareholder approval at our AGM on the 11th of May.,Positive
The 54 EBITDA increase was driven by the record revenue number of 829 million an increase of 176 million on 2019 driven by an increased average realized price up 26 yearoveryear but our focus has firmly been on cost containment and managing whats within our control.,Negative
For those of you who have followed Centamin for some time will know that we went through a multiyear efficiency program to reduce our stock and working capital balances. In 2020 like many companies it was prudent for us to actively increase our working capital and critical inventories as a precaution to mitigate potential for fire disruptions due to the COVID pandemic. This was successful and we were able to secure sufficient suppliers and ensure business continuity. And weve had no material disruption. Specifically we incurred 14 million worth of additional costs in 2020 directly attributable to COVID and we have budgeted a similar number in 2021 as ongoing COVID costs.,Positive
The company has undertaken risk analysis scenarios and has put in place contingency plans for the business. I believe we have taken prudent steps to continue to navigate these difficult times but it is an evolving situation to which we would rather air on the side of caution. We therefore expect to maintain these slightly elevated working capital levels for the foreseeable future.,Positive
Finally Sukari operates under cost recovery model with our Egyptian partner EMRA. We have increased our provision held centrally by US10 million to cover cost recovery reconciliation items and timing of certain cash flows for settlement of payments before June.,Negative
Looking a bit more at cost. Centamin delivered cash costs of 719 per ounce produced and allin sustaining costs of 1036 per ounce sold both within our previously revised guidance ranges. The pie chart shows the operating cost breakdown. Mine production costs are down 4 yearonyear but specifically processing costs are down. This is a significant portion of our cost structure and therefore is a key focus area and opportunity for extraction of costs.,Negative
We have and will continue to focus on cost reductions and efficiencies across our operations as a driver of cash flow generation. The next 3 years are a period of reinvestment of attaining a higher spend profile has been on the righthand side. It is critically important that there are contained group costs during this capital reinvestment phase. We must remember that 2020 CapEx spend came in lowerthananticipated due to some project delays mainly driven by COVID. This resulted in total capital expenditure of 138 million down from the 190 million we initially guided prior to the COVID outbreak. These projects have been rolled into 2021 the solar project being the prime example.,Negative
Regarding our CapEx expenditure through to 2023 is generally flat albeit at an increased level and then expect that to fall away after 2023. The nonsustaining spend is split across a handful of key projects. For example camp upgrades in the TSF 2 which are largely complete this year and then we have solar the waste stripping and underground development of the main project through to 2023. This accounts for the stepup in our allin costs.,Negative
What you cant see on the graph is 2024 when many of those nonsustaining products  projects finished were substantially reduced. At Centamin we focus very seriously on costs particularly on productivity and efficiency opportunities to save dollars.,Negative
Sukari is a bulk tonnage operation. For every tonne of material there is a cost whether it is waste ore. In December we outlined a lot of great initiatives and targets to improve operating efficiencies and there are many both large and small.,Positive
There you can see that volume gains. The bars are per tonne operating costs and the line chart shows our total material moved or ore processed. Showing the results of our focus on cost containment is a longterm view that the unit rates will flatten or reduce over time as indicated on these graphs. The open pit cost per tonne increased as theres a record material mined and we saw the rampup ahead of the contracted waste stripping program. The underground was equally impacted by lower cost tonnes as there was a reduced mining this year due to the infrastructure upgrade.,Negative
Equally processing unit rates were impacted by a reduction in consumables and reagents offset by the reduced throughput volume. And there was an increase in the GA costs mainly due to the impact of COVID and the additional rosters and rotations including bonus and cycle allowances that we introduced to ensure we kept the mine operating and largely fully staffed. The GA cost unit rate uses the processing tonnes as the denominator for the reduction in tonnes of processing also had an impact on the unit rate.,Negative
Excellent progress was made throughout the year against our cost savings programs with 44 million of costs removed from the business. This is gross i.e. before the unscheduled 14 million COVID costs mentioned previously. Theres a long list of cost savings many of which are small but in aggregate they add up across the business.,Positive
But here are some examples of some key initiatives. And as you can see many show initial savings with opportunity for further savings in the future a new fuel transport agreement is signed which reduces the transport cost of fuel to 5.5 million per annum the completion of the new tire workshop reducing the demand for all new tires to be purchased and increasing tire life improved the cyanide supply terms which both to reduce the unit rate but also ensure longer and stronger future supply and we negotiated incountry agreements to recycle 60millimeter grinding media reducing the reliance on imports but also reducing the cost base and importantly increasing local content rather than import. And our inventory management program benefited from stores agreements with longterm suppliers that we are targeting across our broader supply chain.,Positive
The 44 million delivered in 2020 is part of a wider cost reduction program where we have a further 56 million worth of cost savings targeted bringing a total of 100 million worth of savings by 2024. This year 2021 we budgeted for 16 million including but not limited to our 6040 loaders where we have purchased 2 new Cat 6040 excavators as primary production excavation and loading unit to replace the existing 6030 backhoe production unit. With commissioning in the first half this will lower the hourly operating costs in the first instance by reducing by 1 million per annum as a start but will also mean higher production capacity and better utilization and productivity in the open pit. We can see one of the new 6040 TR arriving onsite and getting commissioned.,Negative
On the switchgear in preparation for the full salable this year the highvoltage switchgear upgrades have been largely completed. This was a key work stream ensuring the successful integration between solar and the plant commissioning. Commissioning of the solar plant in the first half of 2022 results in an 8 million to 9 million per annum saving at current fuel prices.,Negative
Lightweight truck trade. We completed the study of lightweight truck trades for the open pit fleet where the goal was to increase payload averages by 5 trucks by 10. However even when payload gains were not achieved due to material quality or loading inefficiencies and faster traveling speeds were found to also increase truck factors by 10 or more. Other benefits of course include less fuel used improved tire life and less overloading and chassis fit. New studies were successful and we have now placed the order for another 45 trades with the plan for the fleet to be fully commissioned by the end of 2021 or early 2022.,Positive
There is a saving of 2.5 million worth of fuel at current prices even before we factor in a quicker cycle time and increased payloads. In addition to these great budgeted initiatives and as part of the Phase 2 of the life of asset review were evaluating opportunities to extract a further 30 million to 40 million. These include programs such as assessing the underground mining contract process plant optimization opportunities expatriate reduction programs and dynamic gas blend and our haulage fleet. Once these further potential opportunities become more clear we will work on them with you and incorporate them in the forecast and update you accordingly.,Positive
The company continues to exercise a balanced approach to responsibly maximizing cash flow generation reinvesting for future growth and prioritizing sustainable shareholder returns. Capital allocation continues to be disciplined and closely qualified against value creation.,Positive
Some key projects include construction of our second tailing storage facility which provides the base to extend our tailings capacity to 2030 with our largest capital project this year and was delivered on time and slightly ahead of budget. Commissioning is currently underway which will dovetail with the closure of TSF 1.,Negative
Sukari camp upgrade our ongoing focus of creating a positive work environment for our employees saw significant upgrades to the Sukari camp including 8 new accommodation blocks new gym communal areas and the new football pitch. This build is today 80 complete and remains on track for completion in Q2.,Positive
As discussed earlier in 2020 underground tonnage was almost at 50 capacity as the focus was on delivering underground infrastructure upgrades position the underground for the next stage of growth. These upgrades included improvements in the ventilation system to improve air quality and operating temperatures of greater depth. COVID19 did pose a challenge in our original plans to use a thirdparty contractor. In the end stage 1 of the upgrades was successfully delivered utilizing our own workforce and now onsite equipment thereby reducing costs and also resulting in a 70 improvement in air quality. In our solar plant preparatory works ahead of the main solar project construction progressed well throughout the year with site earthwork 61 complete and civil engineering works for the highvoltage switchgear station nearly complete. This is a key project and is ongoing with project construction expected to ramp up through 2021 ahead of anticipated commissioning in the first half of 2022.,Positive
Not only will this reduce operating costs but importantly will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels energy intensity and greenhouse gas emission. New capital tax commencing in 2021 include the main solar construction and increased waste stripping and underground development to increase mining flexibility. This includes the pace of store plant. Investments in technology people and training are additional critical areas as the company continues to invest to further improve operational performance.,Negative
In summary we have a strong balance sheet with 310 million worth of cash and liquids at the end of the year. We are going through an investment phase and we will be utilizing our balance sheet to finance but we will maintain our strong balance sheet position.,Positive
We said at the beginning of the year that we plan to extract 50 million from the business in 2020 and we largely did that with 44 million extracted. Were targeting another 56 million to be extracted going forward. So in total taking 100 million worth of cost out of the business over the 3 years. These are genuine identified opportunities that are sustainable and will be delivered.,Positive
Were disciplined on our capital allocation. Some projects were deferred into 2021 due to COVID restrictions those that could progress and were delivered on time and on budget and well continue with this discipline and delivery. And this will result in maximizing free cash flow where we generated 142 million for the year and that meant we could deliver another year of reliable and consistent shareholder returns.,Positive
Lastly and not least we want to reassure our commitment to shareholders and reflecting our confidence in our new approach reset plans the Centamin Board reconfirmed its intention to distribute a minimum payoff of 105 million for 2021.,Positive
And with that Ill hand back to Martin.,Negative
Thanks very much Ross. Really comprehensive overview there of the numbers and obviously some fantastic initiatives around cost savings. And again discipline as weve talked to before as well. So thank you for that Ross.,Positive
Back in December at the Capital Markets Day just to recap on that we talked about a number of things. We talked about people and processes. We talked about rigor and discipline in our planning. We talked about improved flexibility and reliability in our production and we talked about a focus on cash flow generation over headline ounces.,Positive
Id like to take on the next sort of step on that journey and Ill take this opportunity to introduce you to our  what were calling our new orebody stewardship model at Sukari. In practice what does that mean It means were fully going  were going to fully explore the concession area with the aim of identifying all potential resources. And then were going to seek to maximize the extraction of any economic ounces that we find.,Positive
In terms of geology weve been refreshing our whole approach to exploration and orebody management under the leadership of our strengthened geological team. The concession wide exploration effort has been reinvigorated and weve refocused efforts around the orebody. Both initiatives are all improving successful in identifying new opportunities for growth which Ill discuss a little bit later on.,Positive
As for our mining operations delighted to say weve had an update on the geotechnical input that we need to use for our longterm planning in the open pit. And Im pleased that theyve been complementary with only a minor relaxation in the overall pit slopes in the East and the West walls and actually an ability to steep in both the North and the South walls as well. So thats fantastic news for us.,Positive
More importantly weve also reassessed the approach to the open pit. And weve been able to redesign the pit to produce more cash flow while simultaneously reducing operating risk. In the underground this revised philosophy as seen as moved to employing an economic cut off strategy which will focus on the maximization of ore extraction. And these changes really start to deliver into our vision of Sukari of that 452000 ounce producer on an annualized basis with a targeted allin sustaining cost of 900 per ounce. So our new approach to the open pit design achieved not only an increase in cash flows of the life of mine but it simultaneously reduces the operating risk kind of holy rail of more money less problems which were very pleased about.,Positive
A few things to note in respect to this update as well. It does actually represent 18 months of mining depletion. Weve moved Sukari from a June to December reporting date. Therefore the depletion associated with this change is just under 1 million ounces of production. Weve used the updated geotechnical inputs as part of the planning process and the cost control that Ross mentioned earlier theyve been incorporated into the budgeted savings and planned productivity efficiencies that we hope to get as well.,Positive
So in essence weve taken the decision to redesign the open pit at the Northeast end of the operation and to exclude some deeper lying medium grade material which is at about 0.8 a gram per tonne. This material is a strip ratio of about 101 and would represent just under about 0.5 billion of waste mining costs alone. And this marginal material will set to be mined at the end of the operating life which will be effectively next decade but the associated stripping that comes with it would be starting in the near term. And this change has basically had the impact of driving better cash flows through the production of that overall waste stripping cost which actually more than sets off the resulting reduction in revenues from the mine  the decision not to mine the gold.,Negative
I think its important to note as well that the gold hasnt been sterilized. That gold is still available to us and we do believe theres an opportunity to bring these ounces back into the plan and future work supports that. With pit wall reduced in height and reduced interaction with historical underground mining infrastructure we believe this plan has lower implementation risk when compared to the previous version.,Positive
Its got further benefits regarding the millfield schedule with lock stockpile material now substantively moved to the end of the operating line. Were going to continue to refine and optimize the schedule of the balance this year but the change in design really starts to underpin and deliver into our vision of Sukari as that consistent 450000 to 500000 ounce per annum producer for the balance of its operating life. And I also believe that theres excellent potential to further grow the resource and reserve base at Sukari.,Positive
I think weve all been aware of the potential resource growth in the underground. But more recently what we started to identify is the areas in the open pit we also believe have got great potential for growth. I mentioned those the ability to bring in the deep lying ounces to the Northeast of the pit back into the plan in due course. And were going to work on that over this year and next year to assess their oxide geological potential and ability to potentially convert some of the associated waste to ore with different zones and mineralization there and a further optimized operating cost.,Positive
In the Western zone of the pit weve historically seen the mining operation outperform the ore predicted from our resource models. Put simply weve got more gold than we plan for in certain areas of the pit. And when were assessing the reasons for this we believe that drill spacing is one of the main drivers for this. In order to address this were implementing a 20kilometer infill campaign targeting the Western areas of Stage 5 and 6 pits and this has a good potential to potentially convert waste to ore inside the design pit. And its a similar situation that the clear path is one of the open pit. And while it represents a relatively low strip but medium grade mining zone at this time again is underpinned by a relative lack of drilling data due to the topography in this area.,Positive
With that opening up now weve got an infill tool campaign which is starting shortly and has the potential to improve the ore profile in this area of the pit. As I said before with both of these areas already inside the pit design the ability to convert some of the existing planned waste to ore is absolutely excellent to pit economics.,Positive
In terms of the underground were applying that same philosophy as the open pit and thats maximizing economic ore extraction to generate best cash flows. In practice this means that we sort of design underground using an economic cut off of 1.6 grams per tonne of gold whereas weve previously used a 3gram cutoff. It means designing stopes that mirror actual underground practices. It means tonnage per dilution as part of the design and estimation process. And it means using backfill to ensure that we can maximize extraction we can preserve the grade as best we can and give us better ground control. Again we believe this approach is helping to drive improved cash flows while reducing operating risk.,Positive
As I mentioned before the underground has long demonstrated and delivered into its resource growth potential. The orebody remains open to depth in a long strike and we believe the whole risk zone represents the longterm future of the underground at this time.,Negative
Building over 2021 continues to support this with some really encouraging drill results  achieved  sorry Ill start again really encouraging drill results achieved to support this thesis. While Horus is the future its going to take us some time and cost both to drill off this area and then develop the underground infrastructure to start mining from here during the middle of the decade.,Negative
As youll note from the drill intercepts on the righthand side of the page Horus zone continues to drive encouragement that underpins our longterm confidence with some good widths and grades demonstrating the potential of this part of the underground.,Negative
As part of our new approach weve also been looking at near term potential. Im really pleased that we started to identify a number of opportunities that are significantly closer to the current mining infrastructure. Weve done a reappraisal of the geology in and around the existing Ptah and Bast zones and thats starting to yield some excellent results in a really short space of time. Were starting to see some significant widths and grades have been intersected over the first month of 2021 that really start to demonstrate the potential here.,Positive
For example in Ptah 40 meters at 8.29 grams per tonne which includes 11 meters at 15 20 meters at 5.3. Over at Bast 3 meters at 24 3 meters at 19 and 6 meters at 5.3. All fantastic drill intercepts but just to underpin the potential of these areas.,Negative
These areas are converted to reserves. And given their proximity to the current infrastructure we believe that these ounces can be brought into the mine plan in the shortterm and at relatively low development costs. And thats going to give us the benefit of increasing mining flexibility which will in turn support our target more predictable sustainable production.,Positive
And on a final note I think its important to understand that as we move forward in terms of our underground exploration potential our team and I are now rolling out what were terming an extensional model of exploration rather than a depletion replacement model. And again put simply that means that each year well be trying to add more ounces to the underground resources than we deplete on an ongoing annualized basis.,Positive
As highlighted back in December weve also commenced the surface exploration program to make sure that we fully explored the concession areas potential. Initial work is focused on target generation to date and field workers included mapping and structural analysis grab samples and channel sampling of mineralized exposures. The aim is to generate a number of drill targets which can then be systematically tested during the second half of this year. Early results are encouraging. A number of new targets that are demonstrating both scale and grades that are good for mining targets have been identified. Were finding straight lengths in excess of the kilometer and width of several hundred meters wide and grab and channel sampling indicating grades consistent with open pit mining targets elsewhere in the concession.,Positive
We continue to progress our efforts to get an airborne survey completed and we hope to have this approved later in the year to coincide with the cooler temperatures. Im really pleased with the results emerging from the entire exploration campaign in both the orebody and across the wider concession. Im really looking forward to updating you over the balance of 2021 with news that the results continue to come in and support our vision to grow Sukari beyond its current 12year life.,Positive
Now speaking of growth Ross and I were in Cairo last month and we continue to engage with the government in respect of the bid brand. We remain hopeful that we can include negotiation in short order and were ready to commence work on this exciting opportunity.,Positive
Our review of West Africa is close to completion. By the end of this month weve completed our technical environmental and social plus legal review. And in April Ill be making several recommendations to the Board on how we take these projects forward to start creating value for Centamin. As I said before resources are fine but we want to demonstrate route to reserves and reserves of the quality that commensurate of company and Centamins quality and scale. Im very much looking forward to updating you about these projects and our plans in more detail in the next quarter. I think these are exciting times in West Africa.,Positive
When I think about Centamin I think back to the reasons why I joined the company. It really is a fantastic platform to build a larger multiasset gold company from. Weve got a worldclass asset in Sukari one that we believe can get bigger and better. Weve got a fantastic team with the support of a strong and excellent Board. Weve got a fantastic balance sheet with no debt or hedging. Weve got a great record of stakeholder returns over the last 7 years. Weve got some fantastic really interesting growth opportunities that are starting to emerge that we can realize and weve got a clear strategy to deliver our vision of being that multiasset gold producer.,Positive
Coming on to my first anniversary Id say Im pleased with the progress weve made. Im really optimistic about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead of us. I think were really really well positioned. Im very much looking forward to 2021. Ive got a sense of optimism enthusiasm and confidence and Im really looking forward to updating on a number of key catalysts over the balance of the year that are really going to unlock and deliver that full potential of Centamin.,Positive
And with that Id like to hand you back to Ruby our operator and well take the questions for QA. Thank you.,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,Negative
Operator Instructions. Our first question is from Alan Spence of Jefferies.,Negative
Ive got a few. Ill just take them one at a time. So the first one were basically through March. Can you give us a bit of an update on Q1 production maybe a range of where you see that ultimately shaking out And then kind of how you think about the balance of production first half versus second half,Positive
Sure. Thanks Alan. Look I think obviously 2.5 nearly 3 months in. Look I think the guys are getting on with it. Its a good steady start to the year. So I think in line with our  where we are going forward. I think there any surprises or shocks coming through which Im delighted to say. Good progress. Capital are on site. They started to move dirt as part of that waste stripping contract. Thats great to see. As Ross touched on a number of the projects are moving forward as well. And I think theres additional opportunity we identified coming through there.,Positive
So I think in terms of how we see the start to the year very pleased with a very strong start to the year in terms of sort of operational performance tonnes being moved sort of on compliance with plan both in terms of tonnes and grade but also volumetric compliance to make sure we focus on that stripping as a key focus for longterm stability that were looking to achieve those as well. So I think an excellent start to the year with first quarter in. So obviously we look forward to updating you in April on what I hope will be a very boring discussion where we say weve done what we said were going to do and then roll on to the second quarter to repeat again the balance of that.,Positive
I think in terms of the year I think its really balanced between first and second half of the year in terms of production profile. And then obviously well look forward to update you in subsequent quarters.,Positive
Okay. Can I try to push you a little bit to give me a range of actual numbers for Q1 production maybe,Positive
Look I think obviously we said our target for the year was 400 to 430. And within that range I would say that we are continuing to track along  to be on target. Its only the first quarter in so 3 quarters ahead of us. So I would say at this stage Alan that we are in line to stay on guidance at this stage.,Negative
Okay. One for Ross. That 46 million to 56 million of cost savings in the next 3 years can that be achieved while were kind of operating in this COVID world,Negative
Hi Alan. Yes absolutely. All these sort of projects we believe are achievable and pulling them through. So I actually think theres more to come. I think as weve gone into it I mean theres a raft of opportunities that in aggregate add up very quickly. And I think theres quite first allround there. But absolutely everything that weve got on the list and we actually think are very achievable.,Positive
I think Ross just add to that point. Sorry Alan just to add to that point as well. We talked in December about that. And I was always the skeptical. Ive been a consultant in the banker of previous life and management teams to talk about cost savings. And when you try to needle them about where are they going to come from they would just say well just deliver them.,Positive
But I think the thing that I take comfort in Ross is that behind those numbers as you say theres a number of identified initiatives that we believe can be brought in as well as the other ones as well. So I think thats right Ross. I think these are opportunities irrespective of kind of the COVID environment to be able to bring in there. Sorry Alan I kind of crossed you apologies.,Positive
No thats fine. And I just wanted to make sure I was understanding this slide correctly but you highlighted the 44 million achieved so far but only 16 million of which are included in forecast. Is that just being overly conservative Or is there a particular reason not to embed that in the guidance,Positive
Those are the ones that we had actually locked up and we were certain so we had actually committed the capital to in order for them  for those to drop. The other ones are being investigated. And then we would  once weve committed to the capital and unfolded then they would flow through. The truck trades we had already included. We had budgeted. We spent the money on ordering the trades for instance first. Theyre already factored in the numbers.,Negative
But just to be clear Alan the 44 million thats identified thats in there is a further 16 million layer on top of that thats come in. So actually the full amount is 16 million is taken out the cost base. In terms of the numbers of views of the planning for example it reflects the 44 million that weve achieved the 16 million that on top of that that weve identified and theres still the balance to come on top of that from there as well. Thats right Ross,Positive
Thats great. Yes.,Positive
Okay. Yes. Thanks for clarifying that makes more sense. And then just the last one for me just around this exploration strategy update in Q3 do you expect you might be able to say anything about the EMRA bid rounds end Or is it probably thats going to be focused on the Sukari tenement,Positive
I would hope we can by then in Q3 well be able to talk about that look absolutely. Look I think that Q3 update obviously were hoping therell be quite a bit of actual sort of tangible results to discuss. And I think the other thing that would be good for everybody is to actually get a chance to hear from the revised geological team have a chance to sort of have an interaction with those guys and have them present their sort of their findings. The sort of what that informs a view forward and the next steps as well.,Positive
So I think therell be quite a bit to talk to around Sukari concession wide and from the orebody. Im hoping sincerely by them were actually live on the ground in terms of the bid round. And at that point as well were also looking at West Africa. So we kind of hope to treat it is a fairly comprehensive review of that with full exploration but I think it will sort of stretch across the geology and give you guys a bit of insight from the new geological team as well. So I think it will be quite an interesting session.,Positive
Operator Instructions Our next question is from Tim Huff of Peel Hunt.,Negative
Just 2 questions really. I guess the first just regarding the shape of the new pit shell and the open pit. That Slide 19 that you put up is pretty impactful when you look at it because obviously this morning there was a little bit of concern on removing the ore from the reserve. But actually longer term I mean the amount of prestrip that you guys will save on is pretty tremendous. I was just wondering coming back to your question regarding obviously the ore still being there it hasnt been sterilized if theres any sort of early thoughts as to which way you lean in terms of when you eventually get there to the bottom of that new pit shell Whether youre thinking its more likely it gets accessed by decline or maybe from the underground,Positive
Yes. Look I think that its a really good question. Look I think the reality is that that deeper line material that weve decided to basically not pursue in the current mine plan I think theres a number of ways that that could come back in. So we could drill off that material and that 0.8 sort of 0.9 gram sort of target grade could improve better drilling density. We might pick up some more highgrade structures in the area. All of a sudden that becomes a 1 1.1 type 1.2 type target. I think that obviously has the potential to sort of pick up sort of its sort of economic attractiveness. We understand that in terms of the waste on that Northeast side thats sort of 300 million tonnes that we dont strip. We understand that theres potential there. Weve seen the elsewhere in the pit for sort of lower grade if you like hanging more structures to sit there. They might be sitting at 0.5 of a gram. And even if theyre not sort of massively remunerative in terms of sort of revenue is that if they effectively become a  it means its a self mining waste block so that the revenue we get from it covers just the cost as well we might bring that strip ratio down. And as Ross has touched on I think theres good opportunity there for further cost savings as well.,Positive
So when I look at that sort of northeast corner of the pit there those ounces I think theres a lot of work were going to do over the next 18 months that we can start to see in there. And it may be that with that revised work better grades at depth that were able to identify more drilling. The strip ratio changes by converting some waste to ore and the further sort of refinement to the cost base maybe they come back in.,Negative
So I think to my mind the prudent approach right now is to basically exclude them. But I think its not to say that theyve gone. I do think as you say then the next sort of leg if we do that work and were still not comfortable to make that investment to really push down for those marginal ounces at the back end of the mine life is that absolutely of course with the silt in place we can go back into that area potentially if you identified some more highgrade areas and structures to go back and look at taking those from the underground as well. So weve got a couple of options available to us about how we do that.,Positive
Open pit clearly considerably cheaper to mine ounces via the open pit. Of course we can take more of the outage out because of the lower cutoff grade in the open pit. But if we cant make it work from an open pit perspective then absolutely weve got that sort of second ability to go back in an underground basis as well.,Positive
Okay. Thats really helpful. And good to hear that youre even going to be working on that over the next 18 months. So thats helpful. The second question was pretty boring one more numbersoriented than anything else is just regarding that 10 million provision that you made towards yearend on a cost recovery basis. Ross had mentioned that there were specific items. I didnt know if you could give us any more color on what were the specific items that the provision was focused on,Positive
Yes.,Positive
Well Ill let you take this one Ross.,Positive
Tim in terms of the cost recovery analysis theres a few sub areas that have been opened. So weve been closing off those areas. So its just truing up the various cost classifications. And we basically closed off or agreed on certain items in terms of what is financed and what gets recovered in those areas. So basically weve made a provision to close off some legacy items that have gone through the cost recovery model. And part of that 10 million that will get unwound over the next sort of 2 to 3 years as we finance certain amounts to come back typical thing is that the backwards and forwards and what is treated as capital and what is treated as OpEx within that cost recovery model and who finances what thats either. Its numbers that should either be claimed in the year incurred or spread over a 3year period. So a lot of that has to do with timing differences more than anything else.,Negative
Okay. No thats helpful.,Positive
And clearing of some of the old legacy open periods that had closed off.,Negative
Thank you. We have no further telephone questions. So I will hand over to Alex for webcast questions.,Positive
Thank you. Ill give this one to you Martin. Would you buy and provide COVID vaccines to your employees,Positive
Thats a very good question. Look I think what we have to recognize is a number of things. Is that individual host jurisdictions of where we operate governments have different policies different procedures they look to do. And obviously paramount for us is that we obviously operate in compliance with local jurisdictional requirements. So were not going to do anything that would sort of cause us to fall foul of any local regs. I think secondly then the next thing is around so the perception of queue jumping. I think it is sort of vulnerable groups more aged groups that require sort of vaccination first. I think there would be quite a challenging moral argument to say why we would jump ahead of those groups to sort of prioritize ourselves as well. So I think on a personal basis obviously hasnt been discussed at a Boardlevel is that first and foremost ensure that we work in compliance with local regulations in our host jurisdictions. And secondly from a moral perspective its obviously recognizing sort of the rollout sort of to atrisk groups and vulnerable groups ahead of sort of healthier population is a key part of the vaccine program. Certainly that weve seen here in the UK as well. So I think Id be quite nervous around sort of being perceived to sort of jump queues to get ahead. I dont think that would be a particularly sort of the smart thing to do on a longterm basis.,Positive
Okay. And just a question around the new pit design. When do the benefits from the new pit shell impact stripping And is that deferring 2021 volumes Or does that save 2025 to 2030 volume,Positive
Yes. I think if you think about the sequencing of when we would sort of start the final cutback to go to the ultimate pit shell is that thats really going to start coming through I would say sort of 23 24. And as I touched on one of the earlier comments there I think weve got about 18 months to really investigate this deeper material and work out whether we do want to bring it back into the schedule or not. I think we can make it work. And I think sort of into 24 25 is when were going to have to make that decision of where we set that ultimate pit limit. So weve got a little bit of time to do that work and make the decision.,Positive
And as you say if we decide to go for it stripping would commence sort of relatively 24 25 over the decade. If we decide not to go for it then obviously that material wont be mined in that period and well stick with a slightly smaller shell as well. So it does give us a period now to complete this work before we have to start making decisions. We can always go back and do a cutback and push back the all if we decide to go through it later but book far better would be to set your final pit limits and then mine that in proper orderly sequence on that longterm basis as well.,Positive
So yes well work on this through 21 22. Make some decisions in 23 24 about sort of setting the ultimate pit limit to start that stripping.,Positive
Thank you. Question back in  back on Egypt. What is your perception of the risk that the Egyptian Government could renegotiate higher royalties or taxes given Egypts fiscal situation,Positive
So interestingly Ross and I as I mentioned before were in Cairo last month. We went down there for meetings with the Minister of Petroleum and EMRA our JV partner in effect. And actually while we were there we also had the opportunity and meetings arranged. We met the Prime Minister Minister of Finance and the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Egypt as well. So we had a really good meeting at the cabinet office. And one of the statements that the Prime Minister made unprompted from Ross and I was that the current government is looking not to challenge existing commercial relationships in any sector mining oil and gas whatever it might be. And in fact they are very keen to see contracts onwards with no variation of terms from that going forward as well. So its a really interesting comment that the Prime Minister himself made to us.,Positive
So I would take a lot  I personally  Ross and I felt a lot of comfort from hearing that as being stated aimed. The government is very aware of attempting to attract new foreign direct investment into the mining sector. Its keen to sort of demonstrate stability and the operating environment can work in. And I think theyre very aware of sort of varying existing contracts is not a good thing as well.,Positive
So I think its always a risk. Governments change people change. But at this stage I think where we are what we heard at the meeting direct from the Prime Minister in Cairo on back in February was that thats not something that they really believe is in the best interest of Egypt at this stage.,Positive
Thank you. And another question can you please remind us of the carrying value of the West African portfolio,Positive
Im going to have to pass to Ross do you have a specific number,Negative
Yes. So the carrying value the accounting carrying value is 34 million thats just on the balance sheet. That is the residual acquisition price that was carried on when Ampella was purchased.,Negative
Thank you.,Positive
Thats the book value that we have on the exploration.,Negative
No sorry sorry for coming you off. And its another one for you Ross actually. Is it possible to discuss the change in receivables and payables Is this a oneoff benefit that will reverse Or is this something that we should consider going forward,Positive
The key changes there are the timing of our gold sales shipments. And as I refer to the financial statements its really the timing of various receivables and payables with the gold sales in particular for compliance. And the bullions was actually held in the face. So youll see last year there was abnormally high I think we had 17000 ounces that was held and this period ended this score. So its really again just timing.,Negative
And one last question that just snuck in. And actually next is a nice teaser for the West Africa review will be making next month but which of your exploration assets gives you the most optionality,Positive
Someone attempting to view what the next information out there I think at this stage. So its not to front run any of the exciting news down the track. Look I think that when we look at the projects is that first sort of first gating test is can we see a potential for a project to reminder Can we see these resources convert to reserve And I think thats the first thing. And we sort of take a step back a few of the people that work  that I worked with previously weve had some pretty good success in taking exploration projects into production in West Africa. And that same team was effectively  were running the rule over sort of the Batie West Doropo and ABC. So I think were looking at that very much is how do we take these projects forward. I think once you understand that the next question then becomes can you identify a Centamin scale project Is it that sort of 8year minimum life Can we see 150000 ounces to 175000 ounces of annualized production Can we see industry standard sort of processing techniques Have we got a project thats robust And is a commensurate scale for a company of our scale quite frankly And then the final thing of course then is that is in the jurisdiction where we believe that we can actually then roll that forward and put that into production with a center confidence as well.,Positive
So thats if you like the kind of the gating process were going through. That is substantially done now across all 3 of those projects. And I think that sort of when we look at sort of scale and potential country longterm country view as well. As I said before Im quite excited about sort of what is emerging from that and the potential that we can identify to roll some of those projects to that next stage as well. So Im going to stop short there before I sort of say too much more. Obviously weve got to present to the Board our findings agree a route map there and then very much looking forward to sort of getting that information out. But its been a good process. And I think yes thats a conversation looking forward to having.,Positive
Great. Well Ive just been informed that there is actually one more question on the telephone line. So Im just going to hand back to Ruby the operator to open that line.,Positive
Thank you Alex. Our final question is a followup from Alan Spence of Jefferies.,Positive
A bit of a followup question from what Tim was asking about. You mentioned some of the ways some of that material could come back into the mine plan. But what if ultimately that doesnt materially change Whats the gold price where that waste stripping is breakeven to the additional revenue from those ounces,Positive
It would work at todays prices. So if you could give me todays price 2032 2033 between now and then Alan if you could underwrite that for me then then I think that would be fine. So its not 1 million miles away from where we are. But when we look at longterm sort of prices prudent sort of planning longterm pit shell sort of planning as well on a 10yearplus basis weve got to have an inherent level of if you like say conservatism but sort of prudent planning around that. And I think when I look at that I dont strictly think of a gold price thats going to make it work. I do think its going to be a contributory factors of improved grade in that area if we can drill that off and prove that up. I think of some of that waste changing as I said is the operating cost base coming down as well.,Positive
So I think its going to be a number of different factors that will  if we can bring that in there theyre all going to play a contributory part. I dont just see it being a simple gold price gets to this. Were comfortable for the longterm we bring them in. So those ounces at todays spot yes I think wed probably go for it.,Positive
But I think sort of the longerterm prices were looking at but I think its at that stage it doesnt make the hurdle rate. And I think prudent to say we drop them out improve the cash flows and reduce our risk.,Negative
We have no further questions so Ill hand back to our host.,Negative
Thank you very much. Well thank you everybody for taking the time to listen in and for the questions. Hopefully you found that interesting. Any further questions comments to carry upon feel free to contact us. Im available. And obviously Alex on the call as well. So happy to do that. Look as I said look I think 2020 year  2020 was a pivotal year for Centamin. Lots of work done lots of sort of effort put in to deliver that vision of where we see the company going. And I think Im genuinely sort of looking forward to 2021 and beyond to be able to deliver some of that upside news for you. I think weve got a clear plan in place. I think weve got the right people to deliver that plan. Weve got some really good momentum now going with us both at Sukari and across West Africa and I really look forward to updating you in the future on our future endeavors and delivering some more good news as we roll into 21 and beyond.,Positive
So thank you again to everybody. Please stay safe and these are slightly strange challenging uncertain times and look forward to talking to you all again in a not too distance. Thanks very much.,Positive
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.,Positive
Good day and welcome to the Acorn Energy Fourth Quarter and Year End 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listenonly mode. Operator Instructions Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tracy Clifford CFO of Acorn Energy and COO of its OmniMetrix subsidiary. Please go ahead.,Positive
Thank you and welcome everyone to todays conference call. As a reminder many of the statements made in todays prepared remarks or in response to your questions may be forwardlooking. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. For example the operating and financial performance of the company in 2021 and future years is subject to factors such as risks associated with disruptions to business operations and customer demand resulting from the impact of the COVID19 pandemic executing the companys operating strategy maintaining high renewal rates growing our customer base changes in technology changes in the competitive environment financial and economic risks as well as having access to sufficient capital for growth.,Positive
Forwardlooking statements are based on managements beliefs as well as assumptions made using information currently available to management pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There are no assurances that Acorn or OmniMetrix will be able to achieve their growth goals in 2021 nor in future years. The company also undertakes no obligation to disclose any revisions to these forwardlooking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date made. A full discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect the company is included in the Risk Factors on Acorns Form 10K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.,Positive
Now I will hand the call over to Acorns CEO Jan Loeb. Jan,Positive
Thank you Tracy and good morning to those joining our call. Id like to start today by saying that I am very proud of the OmniMetrix team and grateful for how they rose to the challenges we faced over the past year.,Positive
Despite significant business challenges posed by COVID19 Acorn was able to achieve profitability on a net income basis in the fourth quarter and positive cash flow for the quarter and full year. These are very significant milestones for our company and ones that we have been working toward for several years. Whats even more important is that we believe Acorn is on track to achieve profitability and positive cash flow on a consolidated basis for the full year 2021 and moving forward.,Positive
This is particularly significant for Acorn because we have nearly 70 million of net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs. These NOLs will shelter our future net income from federal taxes for the foreseeable future positively impacting our operating cash flow and benefiting our future cash balances and financial positioning. Further we no longer have any debt as we paid off our line of credit last month. What this means for our shareholders is we now have a growing cashgenerating and selffunding business with attractive margins and recurring revenue streams. This should make our public equity more attractive to a broader base of investors and puts us in a stronger position to pursue valueenhancing investments and opportunities.,Positive
Importantly throughout 2020 and the ongoing spread of the pandemic we were able to remain fully operational without any employee furloughs. We did however experience an interruption in all business development dialogues particularly within our Corrosion Protection or CP business as prospective customers halted procurement discussions and inperson sales meetings. Nevertheless the strength of our value proposition and business model enabled Acorn to achieve yearoveryear GAAP revenue growth in 2020 and to maintain our cash basis sales at 2019 levels.,Negative
We also further improved our gross margins to 69.8 in 2020 versus 65  65.4 in 2019 reflecting an improvement in hardware margins and an increase in highermargin monitoring revenue as a percentage of total revenue. In addition the personal challenges we all faced with the spread of COVID some also faced the unpredictable damaging impacts of mother nature 2020 and the beginning of 2021 has been another period of severe weather patterns from wildfires in California to extreme cold in Texas. Severe weather continues to disrupt and expose the national problem of aging power grids. This increasing incidence of power outages is a driver of backup generator power installations even in places that historically have not been large markets for us.,Negative
California for example has not historically been a big market for generators which may now be a big market opportunity for generator OEMs thereby growing the base of potential endpoints to offer our monitoring and control products and services. These trends combined with the very limited penetration of backup generator monitoring in both commercial industrial and consumer settings as well as the growing base of people who work remotely are important demand drivers underlying our longterm growth outlook. It is estimated that as little as 15 of backup power generators are currently monitored which support our longterm growth yield.,Positive
In the near term we believe we have a strong foundation upon which to achieve further top line and bottom line growth in fiscal 2021. As business conditions gradually return to a more normalized state particularly in our dialogues with natural gas pipeline operators. In the latter part of 2020 we were able to begin reengaging in sales dialogues with large companies and we are working to build on that activity this year.,Negative
To that end we recently added a new sales engineer to support business development efforts in our pipeline Corrosion Protection segment so that we were able to adequately support an expected increase in business development efforts. We also added an additional sales engineer in our larger power generation segment to support expected growth from our focus on the commercial and industrial market segments.,Positive
Our growth prospects are also driven by OmniMetrix cuttingedge technology and solutions and our ongoing investment in new product development and innovation. During 2020 we launched our new Smart Annunciator solution which revolutionize circuit annunciator monitoring by refining a 5inch touchscreen LCD display on the device which combined with our remote monitoring technology provides realtime SaaS and lower missioncritical circuitry.,Positive
In late 2020 we also upgraded and launched our nextgeneration OmniPro data management software used in our pipeline Corrosion Protection solutions. This software builds upon our product capabilities to enhance the value and effectiveness of our Hero2 Rectifier Monitor and our Patriot test station monitors while also relying customers to import non OmniMetrix data. This valueadded solution solves a key pain point for our pipeline customers by enabling the centralized tracking of critical data and assets on a hardware agnostic basis.,Positive
We are excited to be reengaging with customer prospects regarding this important new solution. We are also focused on adding sales support behind our AirGuard air compressor monitoring solution which is still in its early stages of commercialization having been first launched in 2019. And in order to deliver greater value to our customers and maintain our technology leadership position in the remote monitoring marketplace. We plan to continue our investments in RD and new product development and we expect to launch additional product enhancements and new products this year.,Positive
Turning back to our financials Acron was successful in substantially strengthening our financial position in 2020 increasing cash by 816000 to over 2 million at yearend reflecting 464000 in operating cash flow and net Paycheck Protection Program loan proceeds of 421000 partially offset by investments in software and new products.,Negative
Our strength in the balance sheet provides a solid foundation to support organic growth as well as partnerships or possible tuckin acquisitions of a technology or product that would strengthen our remote monitoring solutions portfolio. In any scenario we would closely evaluate any opportunity to ensure that it meets our criteria of being accretive to earnings cash flow and shareholder value either immediately or certainly within a reasonable period of time.,Positive
Having forged a strategy that focused Acorns future on the potential of our OmniMetrix business we have been extremely pleased by its performance and resiliency particularly over the past year. We believe this strength is due to the value return on investment and even the environmental benefits that remote monitoring solutions deliver versus resourceintensive physical inspection and the significant limits of periodic onsite evaluations.,Positive
Our clear value proposition combined with continued low levels of penetration for remote monitoring and IoT services in commercial and industrial markets continue to suggest there remains substantial longterm growth opportunities for our business. As our economy stabilizes and as our larger pipeline of industrial customers get back to normal procurement dialogue cycles we believe Acorn is poised to aggressively execute and growth opportunities across our expanding base of solutions.,Positive
All of the reasons Ive highlighted our Board and management and team remain confident in the potential for Acorn to achieve an annual growth trajectory of at least 20 in 2021 and for years to come while also maintaining positive operating cash flow and achieving profitability on an annual basis. Given the opportunities we have identified our strong capital position our knowledge and experienced team and the tangible value we provide to our customers I am very enthusiastic about our business and about our prospects going forward.,Positive
We also think we are in somewhat of a sweet spot with the new administration in Washington firstly because of our clean tech business model and the expected renewed focus on environmental issues in green policy incentives and secondly our large NOL position could become an even more valuable asset corporate tax rates were to be increased. With that overview Ill turn the call back to Tracy Clifford our CFO to review our financials in greater detail.,Positive
Thanks Jan. This morning we released our 2020 fourth quarter and yearend results in a press release and also filed our 2020 10K with the SEC. Ill review some financial highlights compared to the comparable fourth quarter and full year of 2019. OmniMetrix revenue grew 8 to 5.9 million in 2020 from 5.5 million in 2019 due to a 15 increase in monitoring revenue. This was offset by a 3 decrease in hardware revenue.,Negative
Monitoring growth reflects an increase in the number of units being monitored while the decline in hardware sales reflects business development disruptions caused by COVID19 particularly in our Corrosion Protection segment. Revenue in Q4 2020 was 14 higher than Q41 2019 as a result of increases in both monitoring and hardware revenue. In accordance with GAAP hardware sales are deferred and recognized to revenue over the estimated life of the unit which is three years thus 2020 revenue on a GAAP basis includes amortization of hardware sales made in 2020 as well as in the prior two years when we enjoyed strong sales increases.,Negative
Gross profit grew 15 to 4.1 million in 2020 with a higher percentage of revenue coming from monitoring which is a higher gross margin and also due to a favorable change in the product mix of hardware. Gross margin on hardware increased to 44 in 2020 from 38 in 2019 reflecting a more costefficient product mix in the Corrosion Protection segment as well as to reduce cost on new power generation products.,Negative
Gross margin on monitoring revenue remained strong at 84 in both 2020 and 2019. In quarter four 2020 gross profit grew 17 over quarter four 2019 to 1.1 million and gross margin increased 1 to 69 from 68 in Q4 2019.,Negative
OmniMetrix total operating expense increased 4 to 3.6 million in 2020 primarily due to an 11 increase in research and development expense and a 3 increase in SGA expenses. This increase in RD was for continued development of nextgeneration products as well as potential new product lines. In Q4 OmniMetrixs operating expenses increased 4 to 888000 as compared to the prior year quarter.,Negative
OmniMetrixs operating income increased to 580000 in fiscal 2020 versus operating income of 177000 in the prior year period principally due to increased revenue and higher gross margin offset by slightly higher operating expenses. In Q4 OmniMetrix operating income increased to 222000 compared to 89000 in Q4 2019 attributed to the same drivers as the annual increases.,Negative
Acorns corporate SGA costs increased 2 to 890000 from 876000 for the full year 2020 compared to 2019 and increased 8 213000 from 197000 in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 both the increased full year and the fourth quarter increase was due to higher professional fees. Acorn recognized a gain of 421000 in 4Q 2020 and the full year 2020 on the forgiveness of OmniMetrixs Paycheck Protection Program loan.,Negative
Including the gain net income attributable to Acorn shareholders improved to 69000 or zero cents per share in 2020 as compared to a net loss of 618000 or 0.02 loss per share in 2019. Q4 2020 net income attributable to shareholders improved to 417000 or 0.01 per share from a net loss of 61000 or zero cents per share in Q4 2019. Excluding the Paycheck Protection Program gain Acorn would have recorded consolidated Q4 net income before noncontrolling interest of 2000.,Negative
As you may know Acorn uses cash basis sales as a performance measure to supplement our GAAP revenue growth trends. Cash basis sales differ from GAAP revenue because we differ and recognize revenue from hardware sales over a threeyear period. And we defer and recognize revenue from monitoring contracts over the period of service which is typically oneyear. We invoice upon hardware shipment or monitoring renewal and our terms are typically 30days.,Negative
Cash sales are typically greater than GAAP revenue during periods expansion when we are able to be active in new business generation. Given the impact of COVID19 on our pace of new hardware sales during 2020 our full year cash sales only modestly exceeded GAAP revenue in the same period which we view as a positive outcome. For the full year our cash basis sales has held steady at 6 million in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.,Negative
Cash sales were also flat for the second half of 2020 versus the second half of 2019. In Q4 our cash basis sales were 1517000 versus 1557000 in Q4 2019. Were encouraged that were able to maintain our cash sales throughout 2020 at 2019 levels despite the impact of the pandemic. And we do expect that cash basis sales will once again exceed GAAP revenue as the impact of the pandemic recedes and we return to more normal business practices and sales trends in 2021.,Negative
As it relates to cash sales across our two segments comparing fiscal 2020 to 2019 cash basis sales increased by 169000 to 5.2 million in our power generation segment. While our CP segment declined 162000 to 807000.,Negative
Cash generated from operating activities improved to 464000 in 2020 including 164000 generated in 4Q.,Negative
At yearend 2020 consolidated cash increased to 2.1 million from 1.2 million at December 2019. The increase of 816000 is due to cash generated from operating activities plus the PPP net proceeds offset by some investments in software and development.,Negative
OmniMetrixs outstanding balance on its credit line was 149000 as of December 31 2021. And as Jan previously mentioned we paid this line off in full in February. And given the strength of our consolidated balance sheet we elected not to renew the line and wed let it expire on February 28 in accordance with its terms. We believe the companys current cash and expected cashflow from operations provides sufficient liquidity to finance the companys existing operations into the foreseeable future.,Positive
That concludes my remarks. And now Ill turn the call over to the operator and give you an all an opportunity to ask any questions you may have. Operator,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,Negative
We will now begin the questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions The first question comes from Richard Sosa who is a private investor. Please go ahead.,Negative
Hi Jan how are you doing,Positive
Good morning Richard.,Positive
First of all congratulations. As you know Ive held this stuff for what seems like over 10 of my life. So congratulations on your first quarter profit on an operating basis and the cashflow basis. Youve been talking about this for many years and its been a long road and its great to finally see it. So definitely congratulations to you and your entire team.,Positive
Thank you.,Positive
So I had two questions. The last year you had talked a little bit about a slowdown in the industrial markets and both of your end markets have you seen any kind of pickup in the first quarter specifically on the generator side,Positive
The slowdown that you are referring to in the commercial and industrial side is really from the OEM side. So for example Generac has said that their commercial industrial side generated sales has slowed because their residential side has picked up and has been growing very significantly. We have not seen a drop in the commercial industrial side because that has been our focus like the residential side has a very low penetration rate.,Negative
So our focus is commercial and industrial. And since thats our focus weve seen consistent growth in that area. The residential side of our businesses were not so focused because there is significant competition from the OEMs on the residential side. That business has been growing for the OEMs but from our standpoint our focus is commercial and industrial and that continues to grow very nicely for us.,Negative
And you talked a little bit about the new administration and a new potential friendly administration. It makes a lot of sense you have a democratic administration. It would make sense that OmniMetrix is a darling in their eyes helps companies be more efficient helps generators be more efficient helps pipelines be more efficient all of that is very good. Have you heard anything specific to like a specific policy that could benefit OmniMetrix,Positive
Weve not heard yet of any specific policies. But just in general were saying since green is going to be a focus and the administration has said its going to be a focus and going to zero emissions so remote monitoring is certainly an area that allows companies to do that but you get closer to that goal. So we think were in the right spot. But weve not seen or heard any direct policies that would impact us today.,Positive
Thats great. I do have one more question but Ill go back in the queue and let anyone go if theres somebody there.,Positive
We actually dont have anybody in the question queue currently Richard if youd like to ask your next question.,Negative
Oh thats great. Sure. So I noticed you did a presentation with Roche in December and I see that you are attending a conference virtual conference this week later this week with Maxim I believe is this something you plan to do over next few months to be I mean youve done a great job telling your story obviously. But are you going to do more of these and get in front of new investors,Positive
If were invited it certainly would be hope that I can do that. I think our story  I think weve reached a milestone which weve tried as you noted before is to get to profitability on a consolidated basis. And I think that now that weve reached that milestone our next milestone is to show that we have significant growth potential and the profitability that that growth can bring. As you know we have a 70 gross profit margin on our business. So as our gross ramps up the profitability story becomes a very large one. And so I hope to bring focus to that over the next year or so. And conferences will help me accomplish that.,Positive
Thats great Jan. Congratulations. And I look forward to your continued success at AcornOmniMetrix.,Positive
Thank you Richard.,Positive
The next question comes from Peter Rabover with Artko Capital. Please go ahead.,Negative
Hey Jan congratulations on reaching profitability and cash flow positive. I wanted to get some questions on the metrics for the hardware. The relationship between the hardware and the recurring revenue. And so I think Tracy might have said it but what were the hardware sales this quarter 650000 or something Am I correct on that or,Positive
Tracy Tracy you want to handle that,Negative
Tracy this is the operator your line might be muted if youre speaking we cannot hear you.,Negative
Yes. Im sorry. Im sorry Peter could you repeat your question,Positive
What were the hardware,Negative
Is it hardware sale or hardware cash sale,Negative
Yes I guess  I guess an increase in deferred revenue what are the metrics you guys use to track hardware sales,Negative
Sure. We typically use metrics across our product lines as well because the gross margin differs by product. As it relates to cash sales compared to the hardware sales as I was stating the hardware is amortized over three years of hardware sales or actually amortized over three years. So the cash that is the difference between the cash sales metric and the actual GAAP revenue that we recognized. So theres actually three years of amortized sales coming into the GAAP revenue on a monthly basis. So that kind of explains the difference. As our hardware sales increase of course the layers of GAAP revenue that are amortized in will also increase.,Positive
Right. So Im sorry but what was the number of both the GAAP,Positive
Our full consolidated sales across  I dont believe I gave hardware sales separately on the cash basis. Our full hardware sales and monitoring sales for cash basis were 6 million in both 2020 and 2019.,Negative
Sorry I was asking for the quarter what were the hardware sales for the quarter,Negative
Let me just pull that for you. Give me just a moment.,Positive
Okay. Let me ask this question. So while she is looking I guess do you guys have kind of a good idea on  and I think I sort of did it in the past but I dont want to send this number without  doesnt come out and correct but for every x amount of dollars of hardware sales whether cash or GAAP what is your monitoring revenue base increased by,Positive
You cant really use that number because our hardware sales for example rectifier sale is about well call it 1800 a unit and the generator monitor sale is maybe 300 a unit. So you just cant say each dollar youd have to you look at the units.,Positive
Okay.,Negative
Not units in total versus a volume  volume sales number.,Negative
Okay. Do you have an ARR number for the monitoring revenue,Positive
So you could say kind of on average for every unit we sell its approximately 150 a year in monitoring revenue on average.,Negative
Right. Do you have like an average hardware  I mean I guess Im just trying to get better metrics to kind of highlight the value of the company in terms of given your high renewal rate so an increase in hardware which I think was like 400000 or 500000 for the last  for 2020 which was clearly a down year. Sounds like fourth quarter was at least 600000 700000. Just trying to get gauge what the ARR base for the monitoring revenue which is like the  which is what really drives the gross margins the gross profits and the value of the company,Positive
Yes I dont know that we can give it to you here.,Positive
Okay fair enough.,Positive
Peter just to circle back to your question the hardware sales in fourth quarter 2020 were 416000 compared to 545000 in quarter four 2019.,Negative
Really,Negative
And again thats across both segments.,Negative
I mean your yeartodate number in the third quarter for hardware sales was 1.5 and for this quarter its 2.15. So Im just kind of confused on what the GAAP is.,Negative
Those are going to be accessories. I can put together a reconciliation for you and we can circle back.,Positive
Okay. Fair enough. We can circle back. Im just trying to gauge how the hardware sales are going basically.,Positive
Okay.,Negative
I guess my second question would be what the  you guys are you have 2 million in cashflow you are cashflow positive. And I guess I know its a small amount like 2 million on a  but the market cap is not that big. So Im just curious what your plans with the cash flow going forward are,Positive
So we would use it to support our growth number one. I mean obviously weve said in our remarks that we expect the least 20 growth in revenue in 2021 and beyond. So well need some working capital increases inventory receivables et cetera. So as we hopefully ramp up our growth I would say that the cash right now would be used to support the growth of the company.,Positive
Okay. Thank you. Thats all I have.,Positive
Thank you,Positive
Operator Instructions,Negative
Operator are there any more questions,Negative
It appears we have no more questions. So this concludes our questionandanswer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jan Loeb for any closing remarks.,Negative
We are all wellpositioned to return to normal growth trends and to reach sustainable consolidated net profitability in fiscal 2021. Well continue to look for growth opportunities in the markets we serve or complimentary accretive opportunities.,Positive
Once again I thank you for your interest in Acorn. We appreciate the support of our shareholders and Im happy to speak with investors about the company. Please visit Maxim Groups website for information on their Emerging Growth Virtual Conference 2021 which is taking place this week. On the Maxim website you can register to view our presentation which will be available this Thursday March 18. You can also contact our Investor Relations with any questions or to set up a call with me.,Positive
Thank you again for your time today. Operator I believe this concludes this call.,Positive
The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending todays presentation. You may now disconnect.,Positive
Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Im Thierry Garnier CEO of Kingfisher and Im joined by our CFO Bernard Bot. I hope everyone is staying healthy during these difficult times and hopefully wont be long before we are able to meet in person again. Before I start on behalf of our group executive and Board I would like to express my sincere thanks to all our teams for their incredible efforts in the most testing of circumstances.,Positive
We are extremely proud to be part of that team and inspired by their commitment every day. Our agenda for today will start with an update on our operations and strategic progress Bernard will then present our financial performance and outlook before we open the meeting for QA. On Slide 5 I would like to set out the key messages. The home improvement markets we operate in are attractive and resilient and have supportive new longerterm drivers. Current market trends some of which have been brought forward by the COVID crisis offer us opportunities.,Positive
And we are emerging from the COVID crisis stronger with a clear improvement in our competitive position along with strong new customer growth and a step change in digital adoption. We have made good progress fixing issues from previous years although there is still work to do. And our new strategy is delivering. Our distinct retail banners has now empowered and much more agile supported by Kingfishers scale strength and expertise. And finally we have set out clear financial priorities for the group supported by a set of key drivers.,Positive
On Slide 6 Im pleased to report strong financial progress for the period with likeforlike sales up 7.1 and profit before tax and free cash flow strongly higher. Our competitive positioning is clearly improving in all key markets with market share growth at BQ Screwfix and Castorama France. We have strong current trading momentum with Q1 likeforlike to debt up 24.2 supported by continued ecommerce sales growth of over 150.,Positive
Finally I would like to confirm we are resuming dividend payments with a proposed total dividend per share of 8.25p and we are establishing a progressive and sustainable dividend policy. Ill come back to this later. Turning to Slide 7 with a total addressable spend of GBP 130 billion the home improvement markets in which we operate are attractive growing and have many structural drivers supporting longterm growth. It is a relatively highmargin industry resilient against ecommerce pureplay competitors and has proven robust through previous economic downturns.,Positive
The key point on this slide however is that over the course of the COVID crisis we have seen the development of new longerterm trends that are clearly supportive of our industry. During lockdown our homes have effectively been transforming to hubs where we work exercise entertain and rest. Longer term we believe that more working from home is here to stay. There is no doubt that the trend of flexible working arrangements has accelerated forward many years. Over time these factors will lead to material changes such as more wear and tear on the home and the need to organize living space differently thereby creating a structurally supportive shift for home improvement.,Positive
One of the most interesting things we have seen in the last year is also the emergence of new cohorts of young DIYers with a big increase in motivation new skills and enthusiasm for DIY. Recent surveys we undertook across our market highlight that 18 to 34yearolds have done more home improvement than any other age group with 20 doing DIY for the first time 55 doing more than they have previously done and 65 more confident to take on home improvement and learn new DIY skills. All of this is very encouraging for the future of our industry. Moving on to Slide 8. We can see some of the wider market trends which our strategy seeks to address.,Positive
The COVID crisis has led to a surge in ecommerce. The acceleration of our capabilities in this area heavily leveraging our stores has facilitated significant online growth across our retail banners. Smaller and more localized store formats are also becoming vital to serving the increased customer demand for speed and convenience. While Screwfix is already addressing this shift there is a huge opportunity for our other banners to widen their reach. Across Europe discounter format stores have been growing in line with the rising focus on value for money.,Negative
Our own exclusive brands our OEB products now 44 of group sales enabled us to capture this trend. In addition we are well placed in this area of the market with our Brico Dpt discounter banners as well as our overall focus on attractive price position. The COVID crisis has seen a pause of the trend towards Do It For Me due to social distancing and also engagement with DIY as a cheaper and popular activity.,Positive
We expect the Do It For Me shift to remain gradual over the medium term and we are well positioned to benefit with Screwfix TradePoint and Brico Dpt. And our acquisition in November 2020 of NeedHelp one of Europes leading services marketplaces.,Positive
And being a responsible business is a priority for Kingfisher and during COVID has become more important than ever before. Customers are increasingly aware of what companies do for their colleagues and of the environmental impact of their purchasing choices. Turning to Slide 9. Let me briefly remind you of our Powered by Kingfisher strategic direction. First our retail banners are not the same and this is a strength.,Positive
We see differentiation as an advantage more than ever in a world that is volatile and uncertain. We have a clear vision for our customer proposition based on ecommerce we stored at the center a mobilefirst experience in a compelling services offer. We will power our banners through Kingfisher scale resources and expertise enabling them to serve their customers better and will become simpler and leaner doing less lending it faster and reducing our cost and inventory. Across the bottom of the slide you will also see the key strength which underpin our strategy. Slide 10 outlines the reasons we believe we are emerging from the pandemic a stronger business.,Positive
And this is thanks to the extraordinary work of our teams during these challenging times and the way in which we have embraced our new strategy and the agility we have shown in managing the crisis. The rollout of our plans is fully on track. The crisis has pushed us to be bolder and several elements of our strategy are ahead of schedule. We believe we have seen at least 2 years worth of acceleration in ecommerce supported by our stores and rapid changes to our operating model. We have met an extraordinary surge in demand with group ecommerce sales of nearly GBP 2.3 billion up 158 in 2020 and now 18 of our sales.,Positive
Throughout the crisis we have remained committed to doing the right thing by our colleagues customers and communities. We have done this by enhancing our safe operating standards ringfencing and donating PPE supporting our colleagues and rewarding frontline staff and developing our plans to help tackle climate change and deforestation. We also made significant repayments of government support this includes forgoing U.K. Irish furlough and business rates relief worth GBP 150 million and repaying in full government supported debt in the U.K. and France was over GBP 1.1 billion.,Positive
Our customer Net Promoter Scores show a sharp increase in the awareness and reputation of our banners. And along with reconnection with DIY I mentioned earlier we also saw a step change in digital adoption across our banners with 10 million new customers shopping with us online. The crisis has also underlined the longerterm opportunity to manage our costs and inventory with greater efficiency. We took multiple actions in 2020 and believe we can be even bolder in this area. All this is reinforced by a stronger balance sheet supported by disciplined cash management.,Positive
Our net leverage is 0.9x EBITDA and we have access to over GBP 2.2 billion in total liquidity. Turning to Slide 11. While we continue to leverage some of the strengths developed by Kingfisher in past years such as group sourcing and buying OEB and a common SAP platform we enter into 2020 faced with many issues from previous years. You can see the significant progress we have made so far.,Positive
We have rebuilt our teams rebalanced our commercial operating model reduced time and resources on noncritical activities and empowered our banners to adopt new trading approaches. These actions have had a very positive impact on our business. We have also said in the past about implementation of our new plan and helped us to respond to the challenges of the crisis. Looking at France we have made great strides forward in repairing our business there. From new leadership and operational teams addressing all the pain points of Casto SAP implementation underlying improvements to the French supply chain and the benefits from many other initiatives noted here.,Positive
We have also reignited Brico credentials as one of the most powerful discounter brands in European home improvement. The proof is in our likeforlike growth and even more importantly our performance relative to market. Castorama which chairs for the first time in several years. However there is still work to do in France in particular around our range rebuild at both banners and as well as further efficiencies with our supply chain. Let me now turn to Slide 12 and our actions to drive share growth in our key markets.,Positive
Our distinct banners address diverse customer needs and this is the strength. All our banners have a clear positioning and plan. Conscious of time in the following slides we will take a closer look at BQ Screwfix and Castorama France. The role of Kingfisher Group is to support our banners to serve their customers better. These are the key group powers on the righthand side of the page.,Positive
Starting with BQ and TradePoint on Slide 13. The team did an excellent job managing unprecedented levels of demand in 2020 while moving all their key priorities forward at pace. Ecommerce sales grew by 117 and penetration doubled to 10. This was supported by rapid changes to its operations and a focus on speaking for our stores for click and collect.,Positive
We successfully launched nextday delivery from store and have started several innovative trials for lastmile delivery.,Positive
The group nextgen digital stack was fully implemented without disruption and now supporting enhanced mobile and web capabilities. Our new AB ranges are performing very well and BQ kitchen proposition is back supported with design and installation in BQ stores and is gaining market share in the U.K. Our pricing has remained very competitive indexing clearly below competitors. And we also benefited from the introduction of targeted and localized trading events.,Positive
BQ has seen the material rise in its online customer base and is enhancing its mobilefirst and service capabilities. The business is testing to checkout Scan  Go and tool hire concessions at TradePoint through Speedy Hire. BQ also continues to test new compact store concepts as well as concessions in 2 ASDA stores and we opened 2 medium box stores. These strategic initiatives and the outstanding execution by the BQ team resulted in a likeforlike growth of 13 market share gains strong new customer growth and a significant improvement instore customer NPS.,Positive
On Slide 14 we have outlined BQ key areas of focus for this year. Firstly well continue rebuilding inventory and availability ahead of peak trading periods. We are already well placed in this regard. We will also build on the progress we have made in ecommerce with more ranges available for online orders and faster delivery options. Ranges will be strengthened further with more choice through brands and through OEB. And we are excited to launch NeedHelp in BQ which will cover all services excluding kitchen and bathroom installations for the time being.,Positive
We are also relaunching our TradePoint banner which grew sales by over 10 last year and is nearly 20 of BQ sales. Following some early successes this year we will look to open more compact stores and extend our rightsizing tests. Turning to Slide 15. Screwfix has been a phenomenal growth story with a sales CAGR of 14 over 5 years 1 store opened per week on average over the same period and an exceptionally high return on capital employed. In 2020 Screwfix exceeded GBP 2 million of total sales  GBP 2 billion of total sales with likeforlike sales growth of 6.6.,Positive
The business has also seen a step change in new customer acquisition with net customer growth of 16 and online customer numbers up 146. 11 million customers shopped with us in 2020 1 in 5 in the U.K. adult population.,Negative
The team adjusted its operating model overnight during the first lockdown shifting to nearly 100 online. And mobile is now the biggest channel in the business accounting for 62 of online transaction. Pricing continues to be competitive and we are indexing below our closest peer. Finally our expansion plans remain on track with 38 new stores in the U.K. Republic of Ireland in 2020. As part of this we are trialing an innovative new compact format in central London. To Slide 16 and Screwfix is ready for the next stage of its growth.,Positive
Following the identification of further opportunities in catchment areas we now see a road map to over 900 stores in the U.K. and Ireland versus our previous target of 800 in just the U.K. Moreover we are now planning to enter new international markets starting in the first half of this year with onlinefirst expansion. In parallel we are constantly working to improve the business model with digital resources. This means investment in additional fulfillment capacity to support our growth upgrades to our IT platform to further enhance the customer proposition and a new mobile app featuring convenient mobilefirst collection and lastmile delivery options.,Positive
Building on 2020 will continue strengthening ranges with OEB tailored for the professionals together with targeted investment in price. Moving now to Casto France on Slide 17. Im happy to report that our repair modernize and extend approach is making significant progress stopping several years of market share decline in 2020. And so far in 2021 the business has continued to grow faster than the market. Starting with repair we addressed 18 key pain points related to our SAP rollout which contributed to improved operational performance.,Positive
The business acquired a significant number of new customers with associated repairs to brand brant equity as evidenced by a substantial improvement in both store and website customer NPS. The team has been rebuilding ranges both brands and OEB with 5000 new SKU introduced. In terms of modernizing the group nextgen digital stack has been fully implemented allowing us to enhance click  collect and delivery from store services. We launched a new website with visual search functionality and a new mobile app while strengthening our partnership with NeedHelp.,Positive
While Casto is making strong progress on the top line and market share here on Slide 18 I would like to highlight 2 areas of focus for 2021.,Positive
Firstly optimizing our supply chain. We are now in the process of reducing our warehouse footprint and reducing distance to store through the consolidation of the supply network of our 2 banners. We believe this will provide benefits to our customers and longerterm efficiency savings. Second the range we made very good progress in 2020. However more needs to be done to broaden choice within ranges to alter our customer needs.,Positive
I believe we are still 12 to 18 months away from repairing Castos assortment. The same can be said for Brico Dpt discounter model where we are trimming the number of ranges available to drive volume in key ranges and in turn offer even better prices. Overall excellent progress and still work to do. Moving on to Slide 19 and the progress we have made in reinforcing the group powers starting with ecommerce. Here we believe our ecommerce progress has accelerated by at least 2 years.,Positive
Moreover the digital customer adoption we have seen makes us even more confident in the growth opportunities that lie ahead. Back in mid2019 online sales penetration was 7 and we had limited capacity of 40000 click  collect fix per week across BQ and Casto France. Store to home delivery was more or less nonexistent. This has been completely transformed over the course of 2020 with penetration now at 18. Group ecommerce sales grew by 158 and by 144 excluding Screwfix.,Positive
Click  collect sales has become the largest and fastestgrowing fulfillment channel at group level with 226 growth. Supported by our newly implemented group digital stack our platform has scaled rapidly and is now supporting 500000 click and collect orders per week across BQ and Casto France. Stores now sit firmly at the center of our ecommerce proposition providing support for a very significant proportion of retail online orders. We have now rolled out digitally enabled picking for all fulfillment foods for BQ and Casto France and introduce a digital hub model at BQ where 56 stores service the vast majority of our home delivery orders. We expanded our lastmile delivery options.,Positive
Our partnership with DPD has enabled nextday delivery by BQ with 98 of the U.K. population. BQ Casto France and Poland are trialing click  collect lockers and we have implemented drivethru and car park collections in France. Looking ahead we remain committed to delivering strong growth in ecommerce sales through providing speed convenience and choice to our customers.,Positive
Our key focus this year will be implementing a new IT and digital operating model to increase our agility and lower costs. Overall we are moving towards home delivery for full storages with faster lastmile options. In Poland we are rolling out the new group digital stack enabling stronger digital capabilities. In Casto France we are implementing the same digital hub model used at BQ. And finally we are continuing to explore the merits building a marketplace model which could further support our ecommerce ambitions.,Positive
Turning to Slide 20. Kingfishers OEB product sales are now GBP 5.3 billion up 7.5 last year and represents 44 of our total sales. OEB provides a strong point of differentiation for our retail banners.,Negative
And here I mean affordability functionality and innovation and sustainability as well as supporting our gross margin. In 2020 we saw a strong increase in the awareness of our brands and our 5 leading OEB brands alone contributed around 14 of our total group sales. The rollout of Kingfishers new OEB kitchen range completed in BQ in H1 2020 and will complete in France and Poland this month.,Positive
Thus growth of BQ kitchen in H2 2020 was at strong double digits and this was despite the closure of some store showrooms from early 2021 due to lockdown restrictions. Looking ahead the move to our new commercial operating model is driving focus on innovative OEB product development on sourcing and engineering as well as enabling faster speed to market.,Positive
We plan to extend our ranges and tailor them to the specificities of our different banners customers. We are making great progress with OEB powerful enabler of profitable sales growth. Now on to mobile which is at the center of our customers home improvement journey. Mobile is our fastestgrowing order channel up by over 200 last year now accounting for 56 of our online orders. We made good progress during the year in optimizing the user experience.,Positive
We have already heard about the new app and website at Casto France both BQ and Brico Dpt Iberia also trialing mobile Scan  Go technology for customers enabling a speedier store checkout process. We continue to test and launch new service propositions across our banners. BQ has restarted kitchen and bathroom installations now in all U.K. mainland stores and the early takeup is encouraging.,Positive
BQ established a virtual sales model during the year for kitchen and bathroom with thousands of sessions conducted in January. Our new 3D tool for kitchen and bathroom design is currently being trialed in some of our retail banners. With our new OEB range strong price positioning and all these new services we feel good about our prospects in the kitchens market. Were trialing a comprehensive tool hire service in partnership with Speedy Hire. To date we have opened 14 Speedy concessions with the TradePoint.,Positive
We are also in the process of trialing new selfcheck out terminals at BQ. Lastly we are excited about our acquisition of NeedHelp. Business is growing fast and targeting expansion in the U.K. and in Poland in 2021 supported by our retail banners.,Positive
Moving to Slide 22 our 1400 stores play a central role in our industry providing our customers with inspiration visualization expertise projects and customized services. They also play a crucial role in meeting the customer demand for convenience and speed. This customer needs drive both the shift online and the need for smaller stores.,Positive
Over the next few years we plan to increase our overall store count while in parallel reducing their average size. We will achieve this by a combination of opening more complex stores rebalancing towards medium box stores and rightsizing some of our larger format big box stores.,Negative
On this slide you will see all the tests we have completed in 2020 including compact stores at BQ and Casto France storeinstore concessions within ASDA and 1 new Screwfix compact format. Early results look encouraging. With regards to rightsizing we have selected a small number of big box stores to be tested for rightsizing at BQ and Casto France this year with the possibility of widening this over the longer term. BQ Canterbury is the first of this test which completed this month. Around 30 of space in Canterbury has been taken over by Aldi and we expect to save 33 of store cost.,Positive
Disruption to sales has been low. We also believe in partnerships and I have mentioned Speedy Hire and ASDA. Earlier this month we also signed a franchise agreement with the AlFuttaim Group to expand BQ into the Middle East with the first step with the opening of 2 BQ franchise stores in Saudi Arabia later of this year. We are excited by the potential of all these tests. On to Slide 23.,Positive
Our commitment is leading our industry in responsible business practices. As you have heard this commitment has been at the forefront of our response throughout the COVID crisis. And during the year we set out 4 priority areas in this field. Firstly colleagues. Earlier I went through our actions through the crisis to do the right thing by our colleagues during these extraordinary times.,Positive
We were also proud to launch our 1 plus 1 all colleagues share plan with over 9000 colleagues electing to participate 75 of whom are from our stores. Next our planet.,Positive
We are making very good progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As a result we have reviewed our plans and agreed new targets with appropriate capital investment to move to a sciencebased target that is consistent with a 1.5degree trajectory.,Positive
We have made our updated submission to SBTi and are awaiting their approval. If and when approved we understand this will put Kingfisher among only 2 of retailers worldwide to have approved 1.5degree science based target. In addition as part of our commitment to be forest positive by 2025 we have partnered with a Rainforest Alliance and become a founding member of its Forest Allies initiative.,Positive
With customers we continue to help make greener healthier homes affordable.,Positive
Last year approximately 40 of our total group sales came from sustainable products including new examples like LED lighting and lowflow taps. And with our commitment to communities last year as part of our response to the pandemic we dedicated more time and resources for our local communities and health care authorities. We made over GBP 5.5 million of community investments on top of which our colleagues and customers raised GBP 2.7 million.,Positive
We also launched a network of charitable foundations to support the fight against bad housing. We have supported nearly 800000 people since 2016. We are involved with some fantastic initiatives in responsible business which are crucial components of our strategy. We have made significant progress with our Powered by Kingfisher plan. On Slide 24 I would now like to set out our financial priorities.,Positive
We will prioritize top line growth and gross sales ahead of the market. We aim to grow adjusted PBT in line with sales growth as well reinvest scale benefits and cost savings to drive the top line. As this materializes we will aim to grow PBT gradually faster than sales over time. We will generate strong free cash flow through greater capital efficiency and financial discipline. This will underpin shareholder returns through our new progressive dividend policy announced today which has a target cover of 2.25 to 2.75x and is effective from this year. We are committed to maintaining an efficient capital structure while keeping a prudent position at this time of uncertainty.,Positive
While the progress we make may not be linear our mindset is firmly on market share and top line growth on profit growth and cash generation. Finally to Slide 25 let me summarize the key drivers of the delivery of our financial priorities.,Positive
Ecommerce sales growth and sales penetration OEB sales growth new compact stores across our markets bigbox rightsizing at BQ and Casto France cost and samestore inventory reduction and our progress in responsible business. We will report our progress on these drivers going forward. With my update now concluded let me hand over to Bernard.,Positive
Thank you Thierry and good morning everyone. Starting with Slide 27 and the key financials. The group performed strongly last year. Total sales were up 6.8 to over GBP 12.3 billion with likeforlike sales up 7.1. We generated gross profit of GBP 4.6 billion up 6.9 driven by sales growth and a flat gross margin of 37.,Positive
1. Retail profit increased by 27.4 to just over GBP 1 billion with the retail profit margin increasing by 130 basis points to 8.1.,Negative
Adjusted pretax profit increased by 44.4 to GBP 786 million. This number includes nonrecurring net cost savings related to the COVID pandemic of GBP 85 million in the year. Excluding this the increase was around 29. Statutory pretax profit increased to GBP 756 million reflecting strong operating growth and significantly lower pretax exceptional adjusting items of GBP 30 million.,Negative
Statutory posttax profit was GBP 592 million. Free cash flow in part supported by temporary working capital movement was GBP 938 million. Our strong cash position reduced net debt to GBP 1.4 billion with net leverage at 0.9x EBITDA.,Negative
Turning to Slide 28 and the performance of our major geographies. Starting with the U.K. and Ireland likeforlike sales increased by 10.7 driven by strong trading from Q2 onwards.,Negative
The net total of 41 new stores were opened contributing a further 1.6 of sales. Likeforlike sales at BQ grew by 13 reflecting core DIY demand and a strong performance from TradePoint. Showroom categories remained broadly stable despite long periods of physical showroom closures and grew at strong doubledigit in H2. Likeforlike sales at Screwfix grew by 6.6. Growth accelerated through the year with Q4 up 14.7. U.K. and Irelands retail profit increased by 36.3 to GBP 681 million.,Negative
Retail profit margin increased 210 basis points to 11.9 with U.K.,Negative
gross margin up 80 basis points and a better operating cost to sales ratio. In France likeforlike sales increased by 5.1 reflecting strong trading from Q2 onwards and a significantly strengthened competitive position of both banners. Total sales only grew 3.2 because of lost sales from the closure of 8 Castorama stores.,Negative
Gross margin rate decreased by 120 basis points mainly reflecting more trading events at both banners more special promotions or arrivage and higher supply and logistics costs from COVID and from external disruptions at the start of 2020. Retail profit increased by 7.9 to GBP 181 million with a 20 basis points increase in the retail profit margin supported by lower operating cost to sales ratio. Poland which kept its stores open throughout the period saw stronger demand from Q2 onwards following COVIDrelated lower footfall in Q1.,Negative
Likeforlike sales grew 4.9 and total sales grew 8 reflecting through new store openings. Gross margin rate decreased 60 basis points reflecting changes in mix price positioning and higher distribution costs. Retail profit in Poland declined slightly to GBP 146 million with higher gross profit unable to make up a 9.4 increase in operating cost. This was driven by space growth wage and general inflation incremental COVIDrelated costs and additional frontline staff bonuses.,Negative
Iberias likeforlike sales were down 7.,Negative
The banner was more severely impacted by COVID restriction in H1. However H2 likeforlike sales recovered strongly at plus 10.8. Despite weaker sales the business grew its retail profit to GBP 3 million.,Negative
Romania reduced its retail loss by circa 40 to GBP 14 million driven by higher demand across all product categories and the full year benefit from the rebranding of former Praktiker stores to Brico Dpt. Moving to Slide 29 and the movement in group retail profit. In constant currency this was up GBP 216 million or 27.4. The gross profit increase of GBP 297 million was largely driven by the 7.,Negative
1 increase in likeforlike which added GBP 317 million. Net space growth contributed a further GBP 17 million with the contribution of new Screwfix and Poland stores somewhat offset by the closure of 8 Castorama front stores. COVIDrelated supply and logistics costs mainly in France and the contribution of Russia were both negative.,Negative
On to operating costs. We managed to contain inflationrelated cost increases to GBP 48 million or 1.4 yearonyear. Cost related to net space growth in the year were GBP 8 million. Excluding inflation and space items operating costs increased by GBP 25 million or 0.7 yearonyear against a 7.1 increase in likeforlike sales.,Negative
Included in this are higher variable costs associated with higher sales levels staff cost increases from headcount and frontline staff bonuses and incremental COVIDrelated costs.,Negative
This was mostly offset by cost reductions achieved in the year some of which as I mentioned earlier were nonrecurring benefits due to the COVID crisis. In terms of more sustainable cost reductions I will talk to this shortly. Let me now take you through the pretax exceptional adjusting items for the year of GBP 30 million. We recognized asset impairments and exit costs of GBP 27 million related to the disposal of Russia in September.,Negative
The disposal also resulted in an additional noncash charge of GBP 49 million largely due to the transfer of cumulative foreign exchange losses from reserves. Upward revisions to store performance projections resulted in a reversal of impairments of GBP 42 million. A profit of GBP 13 million was recorded on the disposal of a property in U.K.,Negative
And finally other exceptional items contain a restructuring charge of GBP 16 million related to our commercial operating model partially offset by the release of a warrantys liability held in relation to the BQ China disposal in 2014.,Positive
After these exceptional adjusting items our statutory pretax profit was GBP 756 million. Slide 31 highlights a year of very strong cash generation for the group. We generated EBITDA of GBP 1.5 billion in the year. The working capital inflow of GBP 376 million reflects an GBP 86 million decrease in inventory and a net GBP 290 million increase in payables.,Positive
The inventory reduction was due to the strong levels of demand seen in H2 alongside more focused inventory management initiatives. The increase in payables was largely driven by timing of stock purchases and higher payroll and VAT creditors also associated with stronger sales. The payables position is expected to reverse during the course of this year. After rental payments tax interest and gross CapEx free cash flow for the year was GBP 938 million up by GBP 747 million. The net cash movement after exceptionals and other was GBP 942 million.,Negative
Now moving to Slide 32 and our current liquidity and financial position. As of 18 March we had over GBP 2.2 billion of total liquidity available including over GBP 1.4 billion of cash and GBP 775 million of undrawn RCF facilities. This is after redeeming GBP 600 million issued under the CCFF program in H1 and repaying our EUR 600 million French term facility in December 2020.,Negative
Our financial debt which excludes GBP 2.4 billion of lease liabilities was GBP 109 million as of 31st January. Finally to net leverage. Over the medium term we are targeting circa 2x net debt to EBITDA which we have lowered from our previous target of 2 to 2.5x.,Negative
This is in line with adjusted rating agency credit metrics and supports our target of solid investmentgrade credit rating. As a result of our strong cash position net leverage strengthened by over 1 turn to 0.9x EBITDA. Through 2021 we expect this to move up as some of our working capital positions unwind but generally we expect it to remain lower than 2x in the short term. This provides us with the liquidity headroom we required during this period of heightened uncertainty.,Positive
Overall we are in a very sound financial footing. Switching gears for a moment on Slide 33 let me highlight the plans to drive cost and samestore inventory reduction which are well underway and show encouraging early results. We believe there are significant opportunities across Kingfisher to reduce cost by being simpler and more efficient. During the year we launched programs in key areas which are being managed jointly by our banners and group functions. These included reorganizing our commercial operating model testing and deploying store productivity initiatives great automation and launching various IT and GNFR procurement initiatives.,Positive
We also continue to regear our leases as appropriate renegotiating 9 BQ leases in the year for an average rental reduction of 25. Overall in a volatile year we achieved a 30 basis points reduction in our group operating cost to sales ratio on a constant currency basis. In sourcing and buying we continue to deliver cost price efficiencies by leveraging our scale in particularly in our OEB product base. We are also renewing strategic partnerships with our top 20 to 30 international brands which will drive further benefits. And we achieved lower levels of clearance in the year through our focused approach to ranging.,Positive
All these contribute to a stable gross margin. Overall the net savings of our ongoing cost reduction programs are expected to partially offset the cost of inflation expansion and space changes as well as the investment requirements of our business over the next few years. Finally while stock availability has been strained from the COVID crisis and volatile demand levels we have seen a general improvement in our inventory health mainly due to a reduction in range review activity and lower delisted stock. Despite the challenging environment we implemented various inventory reduction initiatives during the year contributing towards a GBP 50 million reduction of samestore net inventory and a 10 improvement in average net inventory day.,Positive
What our immediate focus is to rebuild stock levels ahead of peak trading periods in 2021 our work to sustainably reduce samestore inventories continues.,Negative
This includes work to remove and redeploy slowmoving inventory together with more robust planning and forecasting. To Slide 34 and a brief reminder of the evolution of group likeforlike and ecommerce growth last year. Trading in the first quarter started positively reflecting early benefits from our focus on fixed actions. From midMarch 2020 we were significantly impacted by the lockdown measures in the U.K. and France resulting in our decision to voluntarily close instore browsing and purchasing for several weeks.,Positive
This allowed us to protect colleagues and customers while we establish safe operating protocols. In Q2 2020 group likeforlike trends improved significantly following the phase reopening of stores in the U.K. and France.,Positive
Sales growth both instore and online remained strong for the remainder of the year as we delivered on many elements of our strategy to satisfy demand levels. The momentum has continued into the new financial year with likeforlike sales for Q1 to date up 24.2. We are however mindful of the continued uncertainty related to COVID in Continental Europe. We have some stores temporarily closed in France due to regional confinement measures and a new national lockdown has been announced in Poland albeit all our stores they remain open.,Negative
Thus far this has not had a significant impact on trading in either country. Finally moving to Slide 35 where well go over our outlook and guidance for the full year 2122. Further technical guidance can be found in the appendix on Slide 42. Recognizing that these are highly unusual and uncertain times. On a oneoff basis we would like to provide more specific guidance where we can to help frame expectations for the year ahead.,Positive
This all assumes there is no adverse change in COVIDrelated confinement measures for example any new lockdown restrictions which may result in further store closures. Given the profile of our trading during full year 2021 we expect distinct performances in the 2 halves of the year. In H1 2122 we expect low doubledigit likeforlike sales growth supported by the continued delivery of our strategic objectives. For H2 2122 our planning scenario show a wider range of outcomes with likeforlike sales decline by between minus 15 to minus 5 given the strong performance in the comparable prior year period and the uncertainty of the macroeconomic and consumer environment. On a 2year basis these planning scenarios represent H2 likeforlikes of minus 1 to plus 11.,Positive
In line with our financial priorities we are targeting to grow rebased adjusted PBT in line with total sales on a constant currency basis. For the purpose of this guidance rebase means removing GBP 85 million of nonrecurring net cost savings from full year 2021 profit as you can see on this slide. With our strategic progress we are well positioned to capitalize on the positive longterm trends in our industry and are confident of the continued outperformance of our wider markets. With that let me now hand back to Thierry to summarize.,Positive
Thanks Bernard. To now briefly summarize here on Slide 37. We operate in attractive markets and see supportive new longerterm drivers for our industry. This creates additional opportunities for us. The COVID crisis as pushes us to move faster and to be bolder and we are a stronger business as a result.,Positive
Our competitive position has clearly improved and we have seen strong new customer growth and a step change in digital adoption. While there is still more to do there has been significant progress in addressing historic issues. Our new strategy is delivering with our distinct retail banners now empowered and much more agile supported by the scale strength and expertise of the Kingfisher Group. And lastly we have set out our financial priorities that will deliver attractive shareholder returns. Thank you for your time.,Positive
I would now like to invite any questions. Over to you operator.,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,Negative
Operator Instructions Well take our first question from Richard Chamberlain of RBC.,Negative
Three questions from me please to kick things off. First of all can you maybe touch on any sort of recent survey work that youve done thats giving you any sort of indications about consumers intentions to carry on spending on DIY in major markets,Positive
Thats the first one. The second one is on the sort of new international plans of Screwfix. I wonder if you can just touch on how that will be different from what weve seen in the past for instance in Germany And then the third one is maybe you can just flesh out a little bit more on the relaunch of TradePoint. Maybe give a little bit more color in terms of what youre doing in terms of ranging that business differently,Positive
Yes. Thank you Richard. Thank you for your question. I would say firstly indeed the customer surveys are very important and very interesting for us. We run a comprehensive 2 set of survey 1 last year SeptemberOctober and we did it again earlier this year in February.,Positive
I think the first thing I mentioned in my introduction and I would like to refer again is what is most interesting thing is we see a new generation of DIYer a cluster of 18 to 34 years old saying  for 20 of them they did DIY for the first time. And on top of the 20 55 of them did more DIY in 2020 than in the past. And for a very significant proportion explaining they are learning new skills and enjoying it. In our surveys asking on 2021 overall we have as well a much higher proportion of people saying they will do more home improvement in 2021 than in 2020 and still back in February. So thats for the first question.,Positive
I would say on Screwfix you know we discussed that on previous calls. We have clearly 2 directions. First learning from Germany as you referred to and Ireland. We considered we should start online first before opening stores. And on the other side we will look at countries we know already.,Positive
We learned from Germany on  as well the supplier relationship. We had limited teams capabilities. We did not build supplier relationship before already entering this country. Therefore we consider starting in country we know well when we have teams when we have existing supplier relationships sometimes where we have supply  existing supply chain will be more appropriate candidates. So that would be the 2 directions starting with online first before opening stores and two to look at countries where we have a strong supplier relationship already there.,Positive
Now on TradePoint I think TradePoint is very important for us. And let me say as well that TradePoint are  is addressing very different customers than Screwfix. Screwfix is really targeting electrician plumbers rather targeting smaller parcels. While TradePoint is more on timber building material paint and even kitchen. So we have seen a very good year in 2020 and key actions are on range  ranging.,Positive
And we are rebuilding additional ranging at trade points. We are recruiting. And the past months we saw very strong recruitment activities through our loyalty card programs. We rebuilt the team in the past months and we are now already fully ready to relaunch this business. We have new plan on our loyalty program because loyalty programs are very critical in  for trade.,Positive
So we have now a good team and a clear plan in place.,Positive
We will now take our next question from Simon Irwin of Crdit Suisse.,Negative
And congratulations on the numbers. Can you  a couple of questions for you. Firstly can you just give us a sense about how you see the margin opportunity in France and what those levers will be in the medium term And the second is can you give us a bit of a sense of the kind of components of demand as you saw them last year in terms of your kind of small basket retail customers and projectrelated and traderelated and how the 3 kind of interact and what your thoughts are around those 3 groups going forward,Positive
Yes. Thank you Simon. Maybe a few words about the action we are doing in France. We said several times that probably France was the country and the banners that was the most disrupted and impacted by the ONE Kingfisher strategy around range that have been significantly reduced at Casto new IT new supply chain overall a strong demotivation of the 2 teams that were convinced that Casto and Brico are probably no longterm future versus other banners. So I think we really did good progress in 2020.,Positive
And I refer to some acceleration probably in France we have made some acceleration versus our initial plan. We have very strong team. We rebuilt 2 small management boards for Casto and Brico. We have recruited on our supply chain significant new experts and we are in a good place now. You know that at group level we have decided to rebalance our group banner operating model.,Positive
And happy to say that in March we totally completed across the group this new commercial operating model including in France and it helped a lot France in the past months. We have decided to stop noncritical IT projects to focus on SAP for Casto. It has been fully implemented. We have implemented a new ecommerce group digital stack into Castorama with very good feedback on the customer NPS. We have made I mentioned that a few minutes ago a lot of innovation on ecommerce store picking click  collect drive thru home delivery on the range.,Positive
And sincerely Im relatively happy with what weve done in 2020 because we went fast. So I think we really did a big improvement in repairing the range. As I mentioned probably we need 12 to 18 more months to be fully happy with the range we have at Casto and at Brico. And therefore we saw strong growth in likeforlike we saw market share gains at Castorama recruitment of customer NPS. So all that very positive.,Positive
So then answering your question. For me looking at France I would set up the same priorities on top line and time line. The first is top line growth. In retail I strongly believe that to create value you need to make sure the top line is there and that you have a strong speed and you grow market share. Thats the first priority in France to make sure we are at the right speed and gaining consistently market share.,Positive
Then over time we will grow our margin when we are confident that the top line growth is where we want to be. But I confirm that we are optimistic on the profit margin in France and that well be able to rebuild a stronger profit margin over time. On the  your other question on project trade and DIYer I would say we have been still impacted by the lockdown. So meaning you have people that are afraid to have treat people inside their home. So the Do It For Me part of the business has still be impacted especially during H1 and thats Screwfix.,Positive
So a bit less trade trends. And clearly the boom and the largest trend is around new DIYer. I would say beginner of the DIYer people that do painting decoration flooring but not necessarily very large projects. And because of the showrooms have been closed in the past week in the U.K. as well the big projects are still growing but a bit more impacted that easier project. So clearly what we saw in the past months is the demand around new DIY starting new projects with a slightly more constraint on Do It For Me and on the large project.,Positive
Even though just to mention large project we  BQ and the French team they have been very innovative and fast we have built much stronger virtual appointment virtual design capabilities. And we are saving many many kitchen and bathroom online now which is good news for the future.,Positive
Well take our next question from Warwick Okines of Exane BNP Paribas.,Negative
I was  I had 2 separate questions. The first is on the store carve up or the store reduction size in the U.K. that youve done so far. Could you just give us a sense of what youre expecting sales to do when you take 30 out of the floor space just give us a sense of overall revenue impact youre modeling through please That would be useful.,Positive
And secondly on Brico Dpt youve talked for some time now about it being a powerful discount format that perhaps lost its way a little bit. You mentioned in the  in your presentation tuning the ranges. I was wondering whether you can maybe give us a sense of what the SKU reduction might look like And what areas youd like to really concentrate the range please,Positive
Yes. Thank you Warwick. I think on the rightsizing and you take the example of 30 of sales square meter I think is a good  probably a good average for us. I would say we should be between 0 and 30. It means we should have less  clearly less sales impact than square meters.,Positive
You still have a bit of impact. You cannot reduce your square meter and have absolutely no impact of sales. So according to our experience we have some impact but much less than the reduction of sales. So thats clearly the kind of KPI we will build over time. What is impacting your sales what is the cost reduction you are able to do what is the impact of margin what is the contribution of the partner you are bringing in or what you are doing with the square meter.,Positive
We are still there in the test and learn mode. We consider its a very important topic. We have some time to answer it. So we are running consistently tests in 2021 and in the coming years. And we were ready to set up clear KPIs and understanding so that we will come back with a more longerterm plan on rightsizing. Brico Dpt to start with the range we  in the past years the number of SKUs were probably 5 years ago at 12500 SKU and gradually moved up to 17000 SKU. So without coming back to 12500 we consider we should decrease a bit our ranges. I give you a small example for example the  all the screws categories in the past we had probably 30 to 40 less than the SKU than today. But the presentation was in bulk with very large conditioning totally different to the one you can see today in the store. And we lost probably 20 to 30 of sales in this category because of the change of the range.,Positive
We really moved from a discounter to a kind of general DIY offer and that was not right for Brico Dpt. So we have a very expert team in Brico Dpt. They exactly know what they want to do category by category. Typically for schools we are coming back to very different ranges very different presentation. But you understand we need some time to move from this DIY offer to discount offer.,Positive
Probably we need 12 to 18 months in addition to today to be really fully where we want to be with Brico. And the other area on the range I would comment on Brico is our private label our OEB. We have today exactly the same OEB between Casto and Brico. And for some categories its not relevant and we will adjust we will tell our OEB offer to make sure we can differentiate more between Brico and Casto and as well on prices.,Positive
And Warwick Bernard here. Maybe just to frame a little bit the rightsizing discussion and maybe Im repeating things you know but it is really  it applies to BQ and Casto. Its much less of an issue in the other banners. And if you look at BQ theyre 300 stores its about 13 of those that have big boxes. And then admittedly Casto its  they have 93 stores and the majority are.,Positive
But within those most of the BQ and Casto stores are well located have good sales densities and are profitable. So its really  it affects those stores where that doesnt apply and thats where were testing and looking what works best over the next couple of years and then take those earnings and gradually invest in the rightsizing program.,Positive
Well take our next question from Anne Critchlow of Societe Generale.,Negative
Ive got 2 questions please on exclusive brands. First of all where would you like to see that get to in terms of percentage of sales What might be the ideal level And then secondly whats the gross margin differential between an exclusive brand and thirdparty brands I mean for example is it say 5 percentage points more than that,Positive
Yes. Thank you Anne. Today we have reached 44 of the group sales through OEB and thats pretty impressive. And I must admit that not only the job done in 2020 but all the past years by building sourcing offices designer engineers across the group. Thats really a group what we call it group power to be able to produce OEB.,Positive
We have clear and ambitious plan. I would not give you precise target today but we consider we can continue to grow from 44. Well not grow to 100. They are very strong brands very strong vendors and we need as well to have choice and open our ranges to many vendors. But we continue  we can  we consider we can still grow from 44.,Positive
As you mentioned the margin of OEB category by category is above the average of our business. So we have a clear margin contribution from OEB. Thats why our plan by growing OEB as well not only to push ourselves to provide differentiation but as well to provide more margin. But I cant give you any figures from now.,Positive
Operator Instructions Well take our next question from James Grzinic of Jefferies.,Negative
Yes. Just 2 quick ones. I guess firstly coming back to Simons question Thierry are you basically saying that once you have concluded that piece of work on those French ranges and youre fully happy with those the key driver to grow profits ahead of sales is in place. Is that how we should be thinking about it And secondly in terms of Screwfix International is the time line moving from purely online to multichannel the sort of the 2year gap that we saw in Ireland should we be thinking about that in terms of you opening stores I presume in Poland France and Iberia,Positive
Thank you James. I would say just to clarify the French point. I would say firstly we need to be happy with the top line and the 12 to 18 months is really around rebuilding ranges. In our plan we say we want first to repair and we consider on range its not repaired yet. But I will not commit today that the 12 to 18 months is my commitment to grow the profit margin in France.,Positive
I want to make sure the top line is where we want to be before we start to drive strongly higher profit margin. On Screwfix first I didnt mention any specific countries. I mentioned the countries where we have the existing operation from Kingfisher. Again we want to establish a brand. We want to make sure the range we are starting with online.,Positive
The reaction to customer is good and well understood. And as soon as we have that then well consider to  would consider physical operations.,Positive
Well take our next question from Kate Calvert of Investec.,Positive
A couple from me. First just going back to the rightsizing program. Can you give an idea of the number of stores of that sort of third big boxes in BQ that you think you could rightsize And then the other thing could you give a bit more detail of the online operations within the 56 BQ. I mean how much has it impacted the existing sales area of those stores And then the final question is on France gross margin. Obviously it was down 120 bps.,Positive
How much of that do you think might be able to get back in the current year FY 22,Negative
Yes. Thank you Kate. Rightsizing let me step back a minute to give you the global picture. We do not feel we have a kind of rightsize issue everywhere across the group. Again if I take one by one obviously Screwfix small stores Brico Dpt we are more around 6000 to 7000 square meters.,Positive
Poland is not a problem either. And Romania Iberia again are more around 6000 to 8000 square meter stores. So the question is really very much about Castorama and BQ. And if you look at BQ for example we have a large part of BQ estate that I would qualify as medium box. That are 4000 to 6000 square meter stores.,Negative
And today they are performing extremely well. Sales density profit the supply chain to support those medium box stores of BQ are all very strong and very good. And well open more medium boxes looking forward. Now when you look at the larger BQ big box again you have very very strong and successful ones. Were not far from London if you go to new model its a very big stores very successful very profitable.,Positive
And there is no  I would say not much job to do on this one to reduce the size. So its part of the estate. Its exactly the job we are doing with our test and learn. We want to do more tests to learn more in the coming probably 2 years time to set up a clearer and stronger longerterm plan on rightsizing at BQ and Casto France. And its a bit early to come with a detailed and strong plan with a number of store CapEx and results.,Positive
We discussed a few minutes ago what are the impact what is impact on sales when you reduce 30 square meter what is impact on margin and cost. We gave you some indication on Canterbury that are very encouraging. So depending on those test and learn well be able to come back to you with clearer numbers later on. I think your question on hubs and dark store very interesting very very important for us. The 56 hubs are stores that have been chosen for 2 reasons because of their location.,Positive
So because we wanted to cover large part of the U.K. and we today cover 98 of the U.K. population.,Negative
But at the same time that are large ranges and that are  some are surface space available to run the kind of dark store without reducing the store area. So today its really store where we have large warehouses and we build small dark stores small warehouses inside their existing operation. And therefore being able to capture probably regularly over 1000 order or 1500 orders a day which is pretty good for store operations. At last for France maybe I will let Bernard comment further on the margin question.,Positive
Thank you Kate. Thank you Thierry. I mean the answer again as Thierry said is the key focus is really on building the top line and growing the top line. And then over time with that build a rough margin maybe a little bit less of a focus on the gross margin. So if you look at the  what the gross margin did over the year minus 120 basis points would be driven by more trading events in both banners more arrivage but also some higher supply and logistics cost.,Positive
And I think those trading events in arrivage have done as well in terms of our market performance growing ahead of the market at Castorama and good growth in Brico. So that is important for us. So once that momentum gets going we believe we can get more leverage and grow the rough margin. And what will also continue or contribute to that is the focus on operating costs and the savings initiatives that were pursuing.,Positive
So in that combination strong top line growth and then over time build a rough margin.,Negative
And then the only piece I would say that is potentially more temporary is the higher supply and logistics cost where we had more oneoffish type impact on some of the strikes at the beginning of the year and then we had some COVIDrelated costs during the year and those will not recur.,Negative
Well take our next question from Tony Shiret of Panmure Gordon.,Negative
Just some simple ones to kick off with. First of all you alluded to the reduction in Castoramas range under ONE Kingfisher. So bearing in mind your comments about taking some time to get the range sorted in France what was the actual SKU count when you arrived in Castorama And what is the SKU count going to be in 2 years time And secondly why  or when is NeedHelp going to open in France So thats second question. Third question sorry to labor. The online ranges could you tell us what the SKU count is in the online ranges in the U.K. and France,Positive
And whether there are any online exclusives i.e. are you trying to use online to widen the range or just to fulfill peoples orders who want to order online rather than come in store,Positive
Thank you Tony. So on Casto the figures we saw and we mentioned in the previous months we lost about 20 of the SKU between 2016 and 2019. At that point Casto ranges was about 55000 SKU. So therefore you can see where we have to go. But again I could say Im pretty happy with the progress of the past months and we are moving fast.,Positive
And Im very comfortable when I say 12 to 18 months that well be back to where we want to. And its not only just adding a few SKUs sometimes its change of layout. Its more complicated just adding a few SKU on the shelf. So Im very happy with the job done by the team. We are moving very fast on this area.,Positive
NeedHelp. NeedHelp we are already in France. We are partnering with NeedHelp for a few years. We started with NeedHelp and we are broadening our partnership in France on more services. We are pushing communication campaigns on our website.,Positive
The big thing for us this year is to start NeedHelp in the U.K. and in Poland. To give you the additional information weve just been starting some testing in BQ for a few weeks in 1 or 2 regions of BQ. So its just early again test.,Negative
But the big story for us is as well to start in the U.K. and in Poland. Online today the range is firstly focus on store. I would put Screwfix aside.,Positive
Or if I look at BQ is ready to deliver the full storage on click  collect and home delivery from store. We have a few exclusive range online that are delivered directly by vendors. But they are relatively small number of SKUs. At Screwfix the model is slightly different because we have a very large central warehouse in Trenton where we have about 25000 30000 SKUs that are not in stores. In Screwfix you have 11000 SKU.,Positive
And in addition to that you have 25000 to 30000 SKU in this central warehouse in order to deliver all our customers. Thats for the online range. And again our first focus is around speed so fast click  collect and fast home delivery from store operation at the moment.,Positive
Well take our next question from Lorenzo Margiotta of Bank of America.,Negative
Well done on the results. Just a simple one. In the financial priorities youre talking about top line growth ahead of the market. Could you maybe just give us an idea of what you see as the sort of midterm growth in your markets maybe by BQ Screwfix in France if we sort of set aside forward maybe from 2022 onward or whatever how you think about the growth,Positive
Lorenzo thank you for your comment. On your question let me start and I will as well ask Bernard to compete. I think 1 key thing we are  again we are very interesting with this to see new supportive trends. And again we try to take it very coldly. I think the first one is around more working from home.,Positive
We see clearly in the future people working a bit more from home. I dont know if its 10 5 15 or 20. But this will have a material impact on many businesses including on our business. It will be more wear and tear people reorganizing their space. And I think the second big trend is the new DIYer we saw during the lockdown.,Positive
We all see people doing more cooking at home and we saw a lot of people doing more DIY. And when we try when you learn new skills usually part of it is staying and we believe part of it will stay with us. So we could have ups and downs in the short term. But in the medium term we are  we feel they are new supportive trends. Maybe Bernard if you want to add.,Positive
Lorenzo if you look at some of the more structural drivers theres obviously population growth. Theres an aging housing stock. On average theyre 50 to 60yearold in the markets that we are. Were also seeing an increase in the housing starts and all that is supportive. If we then do some statistics if we look at the period 2009 2019 what weve seen is that the home improvement growth is larger growth ahead of the consumer expenditure in most markets.,Negative
So thats the  lets say the structural drivers. And then I would say adding up some very supportive trends that we see which may accelerate that.,Positive
Well now take a followup question from Richard Chamberlain of RBC.,Negative
I wonder if I could just ask a followup Thierry. Just a quick 1 on going back to the French EBIT margin. Appreciate that youve said repeatedly that the focus is going to be on top line et cetera at least short term. But I wondered if you can just give us a sense of the current sort of spread in margin between Castorama and Brico Dpt and any sort of sense whether youd expect that gap to close over time And then my sense is probably the biggest opportunities is on the Castorama side. But any more color on that would be very helpful.,Positive
Yes Richard youre right to say and again we have been very clear in the past that the French businesses are made of 2 very different animals. We have Brico Dpt again discounter higher sales density higher profit margin. And Castorama with indeed a lower profit margin but Castorama is profitable. So in my view again you have two different story. I think Brico at this level should really focus on top line growth.,Positive
Bricos plan is around constant cost improvement constant work on the cost base in order to reinvest part of it on its top line to continue to have as today a very strong price index and even to improve it. Why we have more opportunity at Casto Youre right to say that we have much more opportunity at Casto. Sincerely its difficult for us to give more granularity and detail at this point. But Casto is profitable. And we are seeing much more opportunities as soon as we are clear about the top line.,Positive
Because in retail we have seen so many mistakes where with the wrong price positioning with the wrong time on price  on cost cutting the wrong focus you need first to make sure you have the customer with you you are recruiting customer you have the traffic back and then you can do many things on the profit part. But we need a bit more time to answer that.,Negative
Well now take our next question from Paul Rossington of HSBC.,Negative
Can you hear me,Positive
Yes very well.,Positive
Well done on the numbers today gentlemen. One question from me please. One presumes that against the increase in demand driven by COVID19 youve seen a reduction in markdown activity in your key markets And Im just  if you could confirm thats the case or not that would be great. And also Im just wondering what you think is going to happen to markdown activity or promotional intensity once we get out of COVID19 whether thats this year or next year,Positive
Yes. Thank you Paul. Again a few answers and probably Bernard will give you additional figure. Lets start 2 things. First on the clearance and markdown.,Positive
A few years ago I think during the peak of the ONE Kingfisher time we went up to 75 large range reviews per year. And we saw it was too much too much disruption in store probably even the quality of the job. We were just unable to manage so many range reviews at the same time across multiple countries. And therefore we ended up with sales impact and a large amount of clearance and markdown. So since last year we consider with my management team that 45 to 55 range reviews per year is the right number.,Negative
We need range reviews. Its a way to bring innovation and refresh our ranges but we need to make it in an organized way and thats where we are for 2020 and this is our target for 2021. So because first of this reduction of the number of range reviews and plus the fact that we are making them more efficiently we saw in 2020 and thats our expectation looking forward a bit less clearance and markdown costs. Just 1 caveat is in 2020 and early 2021 we are rolling out our new kitchen range. Thats probably the most expensive of the markdown because this is the heaviest changes you need to change large part of the store to rebuild the showroom to clean the previous ranges.,Positive
So still 2020 and 2021 has been impacted by kitchen clearance. Maybe Bernard you want to add on this one,Negative
Yes. Paul maybe to add a few things. I mean if you go back to this year youll see its a mix. So we had higher full price sales and lower clearance in BQ but then in some of the other banners as we just highlighted for France we did do more trading events. We had more arrivage in support.,Positive
So it really depends on the specifics and the specific market environment. And also while in some instances that may be a plus the counter of being in a COVID environment is the supply and logistics costs and some additional costs you have because of that some of which also impacts the margin. So there  as always in the margin there are puts and takes.,Negative
Can I just follow up with one Have you seen any increase in promotional activity from Leroy Merlin Or would you expect it,Positive
Well I would say I put aside lockdown period because during lockdown period as Bernard mentioned for some time we have been just concerning advertising campaign because we just felt it was not right. So outside those periods we see I would say rather stability. We have a very good competitor. They are doing their job and they are as well pushing a lot of promotion advertising but wed rather see a stable situation. We dont see a rise or a decrease of the promotional activities outside lockdown times.,Positive
And there are no further questions at this time. Id like to hand the call back to you.,Positive
Thank you. Thank you very much. So thank you everyone. It was really a pleasure for Bernard and I to be with you to share those results to share our strategic views and as well to exchange and answer your question. Thank you for all your questions.,Positive
We are really looking forward to getting together as soon as we can and when the time is right. So thank you for today and for your support and questions and talk to you soon. Take care. Byebye.,Positive
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the BioLife Solutions Q4 and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. Operator Instructions I would now like to hand the conference over to your host CFO Rod de Greef. Sir please go ahead.,Positive
Thanks Latiff. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining this call. Earlier today we issued two press releases. The first was our announcement of the signing of a definitive merger agreement to acquire Global Cooling Inc. better known as Stirling Ultracold a leading U.S. based developer and manufacturer of ultralow temperature freezers. The second press release detailed our Q4 and full year 2020 financial results and operational highlights.,Positive
As a reminder during this call we may make certain projections and other forwardlooking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company or its acquisitions. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For a detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect the companys business and that qualifies forwardlooking statements I refer you to our periodic and other public filings filed with the SEC. Company projections and forwardlooking statements are based on factors that are subject to change and therefore these statements speak only as of the date they are given. The company assumes no obligation to update any projections or forwardlooking statements except as required by law.,Positive
During this call we will speak to nonGAAP or adjusted results. Reconciliations of GAAP to nonGAAP or adjusted financial metrics are included in the press release we issued this afternoon. These nonGAAP or adjusted financial metrics should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP. However in light of our MA activity we believe that the use of nonGAAP or adjusted metrics provides investors with a clearer view of our current financial results when compared to prior periods.,Positive
Now Id like to turn the call over to Mike Rice CEO of BioLife Solutions.,Positive
Thanks Rod and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining our call. We are very pleased to present the background strategic rationale and synergies as well as the potential financial impact of our just announced acquisition of Stirling Ultracold a company thats been in the news quite a bit these last few months due to their support of COVID19 vaccine distribution and pointofcare storage.,Positive
Before I get to Stirling I would like to give some color on how we finished last year. Ill provide some quantitative data but Ill leave most of the detailed revenue presentation to Rod. To set the context its important to review how active the cell and gene therapy space is right now. In 2020 total funding for companies participating in the space was nearly 20 billion a 50 increase over 2019. Industrysponsored clinical trials increased by 154 over 2019 and several therapeutic candidates could get approved this year.,Positive
2020 was a banner year for BioLife with total revenue of 48 million up 76 over 2019. 2020 media revenue grew 32 over the prior year. We gained over 200 new direct customers with new end users across the portfolio including media thaw evo Cold Chain CBS freezers and SciSafe storage services. Additionally our two largest distributors sold and shipped our preservation media products to nearly 3500 different customers. This is truly remarkable and speaks to how well our direct sales team and distribution partners are planting seeds for future growth. Further to our media franchise since 2016 we processed nearly 300 crossreference requests for our U.S. FDA master files to support media use in human clinical trials. In 2020 we added 63 new media customers and we also added 75 new customer clinical trials using our media including 30 in the fourth quarter alone. Its not a perfect data match up but if we take the ARM data of 154 new clinical trials in 2020 its possible our market share is nearly 50 of these considering we added 75 new trials last year.,Positive
We continue to believe that our media franchise of really sticky marquee customers is the engine that will continue to leverage to market our growing bioproduction tools and services portfolio to. Todate our biopreservation media is used in four approved cell therapies Yescarta and Tecartus from Kite indiscernible from Celgene and Zynteglo from bluebird. CryoStor is also used in four new therapies that could get approved this year. These include idecel from Celgene Omidubicel from GamidaCell Ciltacel from Janssen and elicel from Bluebird. So we could start to see the anticipated growth in customer approvals this year and continuing for several years considering our large installed base of media customers still in the clinic and marching toward filing for approvals in various geographies.,Positive
Turning to our CryoStor products although the pandemic significantly limited our ability to sell onsite in person at customer and prospect locations we gained 11 new customers in Q4 last year and 29 for the full year 2020. Turning to our evo Cold Chain management platform we continue to gain traction and added 14 new customers in Q4 last year. The large pharma company weve been working with to secure some portion of the commercial shipments has confirmed that theyve completed their regulatory update filings citing the EVO platform in the U.S. and Europe. And we are on schedule to commence a series of monthly deliveries of evo containers to our courier partners to support customer shipments using evo next quarter. We believe that over time this customer decision to derisk cold chain management by approving more than one container and logistics provider will become the norm and we will have a strong opportunity to compete across the landscape of cell and gene therapies. In the last few months we also onboarded two new courier partners with Biocare and Fisher BioServices joining World Courier and Quick as approved evo partners targeting the cell and gene therapy space. With our CBS freezer platform again the pandemic curtailed much of our onsite selling activities. However we finished last year on a strong note and gained 19 new customers in Q4 2020.,Positive
Rounding up my recap our biostorage services team had a very strong Q4 and full year 2020. We gained 6 new customers in Q4 and set the stage for significant growth this year with expansion underway in the U.S. and Europe. Starting with this call and onward based on the guidance and requests weve directly received from several government agencies were not going to discuss SciSafe customers and involvement with COVID vaccines. So just a heads up for when we get to the QA portion of this call. In summary we are really pleased with what we accomplished last year and are confident about our organic growth potential and how the acquisition of Stirling will take BioLife to the next level.,Positive
Now turning to the transaction joining Rod and me on the call today is Dusty Tenney the current CEO of Stirling Ultracold who will be joining BioLife Solutions after we close the transaction as our new President and Chief Operating Officer. Dusty has a proven track record of scaling highgrowth businesses at Brooks Automation and before that at PerkinElmer. And I am really looking forward to his contributions in scaling the business. We are thrilled to welcome Dusty and the entire Stirling team to the BioLife family. With our acquisition of Stirling were now guiding 2021 total revenue in a range of 101 million to 110 million and have set our next revenue goal at 250 million within the next 3 to 4 years. I will start off with a recap of our MA strategy and then comment on why Stirling is such a great fit for BioLife.,Positive
Recall that in August 2018 we embarked on a strategy to identify and acquire or invest in novel and potentially disruptive technologies that would broaden our tools portfolio and enable us to help our cell and gene therapy customers to decrease the potential of delivering a nonviable dose. With reimbursement being predicated on an initial and sustained response from the patient and our understanding of the many ways manufactured cell and gene therapies can be damaged during storage shipping and filing we looked at the fragmented tool supplier base and got to work.,Positive
The merger with Stirling is our fifth deal in the last 2 years following our acquisitions of Astero Bio in the ThawSTAR product family SAVSU Technologies and the evo Cold Chain management platform Custom Biogenic Systems liquid nitrogen freezers and most recently last October SciSafe and their biologic storage services offering. We focused on the mechanical freezer landscape since we currently dont offer that temperature range in our freezer portfolio which is limited to minus 196C. Mechanical freezers operate in a range from minus 20C to minus 80C a key requirement of our strategy to enter the mechanical freezer market. We used to identify technologies that are not prone to the typical compressor failures and maintenance requirements of the current market offerings.,Positive
The Stirling Freezer platform is a novel utilizing a very efficient Stirling engine and no compressors providing much higher reliability and uptime on standard compressorbased technologies. There are just 2 moving parts and the energy consumption is a fraction of compressorbased freezers creating significant operational benefits. These are the typical reasons that customers buy from Stirling but the most compelling reason is that all Stirling freezer systems the portable ULT25 the undercounter SU105 and the upright 780XLE all have programmable ultralow temperature ranges between minus 20C and minus 86C which provides customers universal applications for their biologic materials and vaccines that no other system in the world can provide.,Positive
So with this acquisition we now have complete cold chain freezer line from minus 20C to minus 196C that fulfills 100 of the needs of cell and gene therapy developers and the broader biopharma market. The strategic fit is excellent. In addition to welcoming the 18 person strong Stirling Global Direct sales team to BioLife who will now also present our CBS liquid nitrogen freezers to customers we have an operational and cost synergy to leverage and that SciSafe is a major customer of Stirling so well be supplying one operations team from another. Lastly we will pickup 80 patents from the acquisition related to Stirlings current and future products that will enable strong sustained product differentiation.,Positive
Now I would like to turn the call over to Dusty to give you a background on Stirling and then Rod can take us through our 2020 financials and the impact of the Stirling acquisition. Dusty,Positive
Thanks Mike. This is a great day for Stirlings team members customers and shareholders. For my time at Brooks Automation and more recently at Stirling Ultracold I followed the progress that Mike and the BioLife team have executed to broaden their tools portfolio and provide more value to customers and shareholders. Each of the assets BioLife acquired were targets of my own MA list. When Mike reached out to me last fall to start a conversation about putting Stirling and BioLife together I immediately saw the strategic fit. And Im really looking forward to joining BioLife as its President and COO and doing my part to further the growth of the company and build into an even bigger and more trusted supplier of critical bioproduction products and services.,Positive
Let me give you a little background on Stirling. The company was spun out of Sunpower Inc. in 1996 to capitalize on an IP estate related to the use of Stirling engines in various industrial applications. Since that time the company developed a family of mechanical freezers and to date has shipped more than 10000 systems worldwide. I joined Stirling in March 2020 after a very successful time at Brooks Automation where I was President of its Life Science division and oversaw rapid growth and the completion of several acquisitions. We grew Life Sciences revenue from 65 million to over 300 million over 5 years. At Stirling we operate a 50000 square foot manufacturing facility southeast of Columbus in Athens Ohio and have an inside sales and marketing team that works in Downtown Columbus. We currently employ 160 team members and have been flat out running with the pedal down hard since last August when our upright under counter and portable Stirling freezers were recognized as key enabling technologies for the distribution and pointofcare storage of COVID19 vaccines.,Positive
In 2020 our revenue breakouts were along these lines. By market segment pharma and biotech was 71 academic 26 and government was 3. By freezer model large freezers were about 80 portable 15 and under counter freezers 5. And by geography North America was about 90 EMEA 8 and AsiaPacific 2. We sell through distributors mainly VWR and by our direct sales team who also provide support to our sales partner at VWR. Preliminary revenues for 2020 was 39 million and 2020 revenue is estimated at 60 million. We are a key supplier to Operation Warp Speed and have partnered with UPS Walgreens and other participants in the fight against COVID. We also serve the cell and gene therapy space in count Allogene Moderna Orchard and Sangamo as key customers.,Negative
I will close with some comments on why our Stirling engine freezers are highly valued in the cell and gene therapy and broader biopharma market. Just as with BioLifes entire portfolio its all about helping customers reduce risk Stirling has engaged with multiple cell gene and regenerative medicine customers provide a flexible solution and maintain the cold chain of custody critical to maintaining the efficacy and viability of these therapies. Use cases include localized highdensity upright freezers at manufacturing locations clinical applications that leverage the under counter system given the limited space to store therapies and a fully mobile solution that allows couriers to transport this high biological material to its point of use while maintaining full traceability at ultralow temperatures.,Positive
Stirling has partnered with several gene and cell therapy customers and cobranded the portable benchtop ULT25 as their pointofview storage. This makes it easy for their customers to maintain the biologic materials that they supply to clinics at proper temperatures ranging from minus 20 to minus 86C while bringing prominent brand recognition for repetitive purchases. Further Stirling has demonstrated that its engines can also support cryo temperatures less than minus 135C without further invention which creates tremendous pathways for further growth as a natural combination with the existing assets within BioLife to address the full range of ultralow temperatures required for viable cell and gene therapy storage and distribution. This truly highlights the tremendous growth strategies that exist by combining Stirlings assets with BioLifes strong cell and gene therapy portfolio.,Positive
Now I will turn the call back over to Rod.,Positive
Thanks Dusty. Ill start off with a review of our 2020 financial performance. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled 14.7 million representing a 78 increase over 2019s fourth quarter revenue of 8.3 million. Media revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 8.2 million a 58 increase over the fourth quarter of 2019. This quarters revenue also included 662000 of sales related to the automated thaw product line 469000 of evo Cold Chainrelated revenue and 3.6 million in freezers and accessories at CBS. We also reported 1.8 million in biostorage revenue related to our acquisition of SciSafe which closed on October 1 last year.,Negative
Revenue for the full year ended December 31 2020 totaled 48.1 million an increase of 76 over 2019. Media revenue for the full year of 2020 increased 32 to 31 million compared to 2019. We believe that the full year comparison is the best reflection of how media revenue is currently growing as it smooths out the quarterly lumpiness we witnessed throughout 2019 and 2020 and which we expect to continue to see in 2021.,Negative
Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 54 compared with 65 last year. For the full year of 2020 adjusted gross margin was 58 compared to 69 in the same period in 2019. The decrease in adjusted gross margin for both periods reflects the gross margin profile of the product lines we acquired in 2019 and 2020. In addition based on expected growth in these product lines in 2021 we increased our fixed manufacturing overhead at our evo and freezer operations.,Negative
Adjusted operating expenses for Q4 of 2020 totaled 8.2 million compared with 4.9 million in Q4 of 2019. For the full year of 2020 adjusted operating expenses totaled 27.6 million compared with 16.8 million in 2019. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by additional operating expenses related to the acquisitions made in 2019 and 2020 as well as increased head count and stockbased compensation expense necessary to support our overall growth objectives. The adjusted operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 255000 compared with operating profit of 437000 in 2019. Our adjusted operating income for the full year of 2020 totaled 293000 compared to 2.1 million in 2019.,Negative
Our adjusted net loss for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 256000 or negative 0.01 per diluted share compared with adjusted net income of 527000 or 0.02 per diluted share in 2019. For the full year of 2020 adjusted net income was 351000 or 0.01 per diluted share compared with adjusted net income of 2.6 million or 0.13 per diluted share in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 47 to 2.5 million compared with 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year of 2020 adjusted EBITDA increased 41 to 8.3 million compared with 5.9 million in 2019. And our cash balance at December 31 was 90 million.,Negative
Now Id like to make a few comments on our just announced acquisition of Stirling. This is an allstock deal whereby BioLife will issue 6.6 million shares of common stock in exchange for 100 of the outstanding shares of Stirling. Based on Fridays closing share price of approximately 39 the transaction has an imputed value of approximately 258 million including the assumption of 8.7 million of debt. When you combine fourth quarter 2020 revenue for BioLife and Stirling the annualized revenue run rate is approximately 115 million. Stirlings margin profile is not dissimilar to our CBS freezer business with gross margins currently in the low 30s and a modest adjusted EBITDA expectation this year.,Negative
However during diligence Dusty and his team did a good job of articulating a clear and what we believe to be an achievable plan for significant margin improvement over the next 12 to 36 months. We expect the gross margin expansion to result from the introduction of new and higher ASP products and increased plant automation which we expect will move gross margins into the mid to high 40s. So while we will see some nearterm margin erosion particularly at the gross margin level we believe that the combined entity can achieve our adjusted EBITDA margin target of 30 in the next 24 to 36 months and with materially higher absolute numbers. In addition we expect the transaction to be accretive to adjusted net income per share next year and beyond.,Positive
In summary we are issuing 19.9 of our outstanding shares which is 16.5 on a pro forma basis to acquire a business which is a great strategic fit and which we will expect will contribute in excess of 30 of projected pro forma revenue and EBITDA of this year and in the following years. I will conclude my remarks with our revenue guidance for 2021. So for 21 we expect to report revenue in 3 product categories first is media then freezer and thaw systems which includes our CBS and Stirling freezer systems and ThawSTAR product lines and then third services which includes our evo Cold Chain and biostorage services. Our 2021 revenue guidance is based on current expectations for our existing business and includes the anticipated contribution from our acquisition of Stirling which is expected to close on or before May 1.,Positive
Total revenue for 2021 is expected to be in the range of 101 million to 110 million reflecting yearoveryear revenue growth of 110 to 129. Our total revenue expectation for 2021 is comprised of the following items the expected 2021 revenue contribution of 35 million to 37 million from the Stirling product line given that we expect to close on or before May 1 media revenue is expected to be between 38 million and 40 million reflecting growth of 23 to 29 over 2020 and accounting for approximately 37 of total revenue freezer and thaw systems revenue including the contribution from Stirling is expected to be between 50 million and 54 million accounting for approximately 50 of total revenue and finally services revenue is expected to be between 13 million and 16 million accounting for approximately 13 of total revenue.,Negative
Now going to our share count in terms of our new share count taking into consideration the 6.6 million shares which will be issued in connection with the Stirling transaction we will have 40 million shares issued and outstanding and 42.5 million shares on a fully diluted basis.,Positive
Now I will turn the call back over to Mike.,Positive
Thanks Rod. I would like to summarize with three key points of our investment thesis one we have very sticky relationships with hundreds of cell and gene therapy companies and our media is baked into hundreds of clinical trials with each customer therapeutic candidate estimated to generate 0.5 million to 2 million in annual revenue if approved two these customers trust BioLife and want to buy more from us so we have a tremendous crossselling leverage opportunity with the rest of our offering and three the Stirling acquisition brings us proprietary products revenue scale and a seasoned team and leader in Dusty Tenney.,Positive
Now I will turn the call back over to the operator. Latif,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,Negative
Thank you. Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight of KeyBanc. Your line is open.,Positive
Hey guys. Thanks. Nice seeing again.,Positive
Hi Paul.,Positive
Hey Mike. First question on the core business preStirling and that is with your talk about a 50 share what does the rest of the market do Is it homebrew Could you talk to that share estimate,Positive
Right on Paul. Yes we believe it remains homebrew. We have yet to see really any entrance of either preformulated preservation media products from any suppliers distributors or anybody else thats out there. So it really is a  its a BioLife versus homebrew battle and we are doing great taking share we believe every quarter.,Positive
And then regarding Stirling with existing ops what do you have in terms of distribution meaning your move in the direct sales Do you have direct sales Whats the headcount there Whats the plan there And who are your key distributors,Negative
Sure. Paul yes we have in the current preStirling organization about 10 folks who are involved in sales and thats a mix of inside folks and field folks Ill call it about 10 with a couple of openings. The current distributors look like this. On the media side again its the big four as always its Fisher VWR MilliporeSigma and STEMCELL Technologies and there are perhaps 30 or so other regional incountry distributors that do a decent job on media. With CBS Freezers we did inherit a fairly wellknown and diverse distribution team around the world with good presence. So we will have a great time just rationalizing this. And from our perspective its just more feet on the street. So its all about a force multiplier to leverage the story.,Positive
And whats the overlap in perceived synergy with CBS what temperature was CBS operating in for customers and what do you see as the positives of those two together,Negative
Yes great question Paul. So with CBS the products are pardon me limited to liquid nitrogen operating temperature range which is minus call it 196 right. Its the coldest extreme for the complete station of metabolism of biologic material. Now this combined sales team has in their bag in their arsenal the ability to offer any freezer that meets whatever the customers temperature range might be from minus 20 all the way to minus 196.,Positive
Okay. And then lastly regarding the COVID benefit at Stirling Dusty whats your thought there Does it dissipate as we move into the year Do we have it visible into 22 Whats your thought on the duration of COVID,Positive
Yes. Paul I think first of all great to reconnect and thanks for the question. I think Mike provided some context there that we are not really at liberty at this point in time just given some of the nature of the placements that we have had with COVID to really get into the mechanics associated with that question. So we will have to defer on that one.,Positive
Yes thank you.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lin of Cowen. Your line is open.,Positive
Hi thanks for taking my questions. Mike just to start,Positive
Hi Chris.,Positive
Hey Mike. Just to start so investors have been attracted to BioLife Solutions because of the favorable mix of highly sticky consumable revenue and just the strong margin profile. Stirling Ultracold appears to be a largely instrumentheavy business that is also dilutive to overall margins. So with this in mind could you just elaborate why you believe BioLife Solutions is the right owner of Stirling Ultracold,Positive
Definitely. I will start and then I will ask Rod to reiterate some of the points in my remarks. So Chris for us this is about the novelty and the disruptive potential of the Stirling portfolio and then our ability to leverage the sticky media customers to expose them to this really cool new equipment offering to solve even more of their problems. And we believe obviously with Dusty and Rod on the ops and the margin side that we will definitely get that back to something a lot more attractive. Its really hard to find bolton acquisitions Chris as you know that would enjoy the margins from the media program that we have had for the last several years but nevertheless we believe that we are on the right track here and customers want to buy from us. So Rod you might want to expand a little bit on that if you could,Positive
Yes sure. I can. Chris as I mentioned on the call in my prepared remarks the gross margin profile of Global is not much different than CBS so currently in the low 30s. But again as I stated there is a pretty clear plan that we vetted as well as we could to take those margins into the 47 right. And once we have done that then I think you are going to be looking at blended margins overall for the company a few years out of mid50s at a gross level. And based on the modeling that we have done and we have done quite a bit both internal and using an independent source we believe that the EBITDA margin target  adjusted EBITDA margin target that we have set for 30 is absolutely achievable with the combined entity. And in fact as I mentioned its going to be at a much higher absolute number of adjusted EBITDA.,Positive
Got it. Just another question on Stirling Ultracold could you say what Stirling Ultracold revenue was in 2019 so preCOVID times And then in terms of the revenue guidance 35 million to 37 million could you clarify if thats a gross or net revenue figure that needs to be adjusted for potential intercompany eliminations of SciSafe purchases Stirling freezers,Positive
Yes thats a good question Chris. So 39 million is a preliminary unaudited number for Global last year in 2020. The base number this year is 60 million. There might be 1 million or 2 million here of RAC revenue thats sold by CBS to Global and the balance of it is going to come in the form of CapEx reduced CapEx on the SciSafe side when they have the move those freezers into the SciSafe operations.,Negative
Okay. Last question for me Mike you referenced in your prepared remarks that there are potential therapies  well therapies that could potentially receive FDA approval this year. As we think about your 2021 media revenue guidance does that explicitly include contributions from these new product approvals and commercial scale manufacturing volumes associated with those launches or would that be largely upside or the 2022 dynamic,Positive
Farther out Chris yes good question. We would expect from most customers just the sort of preapproval clinical trial phase revenue weve been seeing and continuing on to that. And the big step changes will come obviously 12 to 24 months postapproval once they have done what weve been articulating now for many of these calls which is to establish a reimbursement strategy thats going to be palatable to the payers to get their manufacturing operations fully scaled up and probably equally as importantly is to get the clinical centers trained up to administer their particular dose because they all have their own nuances. So think about it on a 12 to 24month ramp postapproval for us to see the large stepup changes in revenue from those hopefully soon to be approved therapies.,Positive
And Chris its Rod here. I want to try to provide a little additional clarity because Im not sure I fully answered your question. So you asked 2019 revenue  sorry 2020 revenue 39 million. Expected Global revenue for the full year of 2021 is 60 million. We have it in terms of contributing to the BioLife fiscal 2021 revenue 35 million to 37 million based on the fact that were not closing the transaction until April 30 May 1.,Positive
Okay. Could you just share what 2019 revenue was for Stirling,Positive
2019 revenue...,Negative
Dusty if youve got it go for it.,Negative
Dusty if you have that handy,Positive
Yes. Its 35 million Chris.,Negative
Okay great. Thanks for taking my questions.,Positive
Sure.,Negative
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Johnson of Stephens. Please go ahead.,Positive
Hey. Good afternoon everybody and congratulations on all the news.,Positive
Thanks Jacob.,Positive
Yes. Hi Mike. Maybe starting on the evo side and congratulations on the customer news there is there anyway to give any color on the revenue potential for evo shipping a commercial therapy I know its a little bit different business model but is there anyway to frame up the impact on that relationship,Positive
Not yet Jacob. Once we get a few more of these commercial therapies allocating or splitting their shipments then we would hope to be in a position to do that but this is the first one so too soon to try to prognosticate on that.,Positive
Got it. That makes sense Mike. And maybe just try and ask it a little bit different way just on the guidance given in 2021 for the services revenue stream 13 million to 16 million I guess kind of a wide range given the size of those revenues. Maybe if Rod wants to just talk about what are the kind of key swing factors for the low end and the high end of that guidance of evo versus SciSafe,Positive
Sure. Its two things. One on the evo side its how quickly the large commercial customer that Mike identified earlier how quickly they ramp up through the year because remember that the business model is a monthly rental program so the number of doers that go out in a particular month if its delayed by 90 days it does make an impact. And the other is that what weve seen in SciSafe for the last 6 months is that the orders that carry over there is wrestling with are very significant orders. And so whether you get one or whether you get half of one or how much of it gets into this year versus next year based on the timing of close there is a lot of variability in that which is the other reason we have such a relatively large range.,Positive
Got it. Thanks for that Rod. And maybe last one for me and maybe sticking with you Rod. Just on gross margins you talked about 50 longer term but obviously a few moving pieces in the nearterm. Can you give us any kind of color on your thoughts about gross margins as we think about modeling 2021,Positive
Yes. I think youre going to see something in the neighborhood of low 50s.,Positive
Okay got it. Thanks for taking the questions.,Positive
You bet.,Positive
Thanks Jacob.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Suraj Kalia of Oppenheimer  Company. Your question please.,Positive
Good afternoon everyone. Mike can you hear me alright,Positive
Hi Suraj. Again hi Suraj.,Positive
Hey. Congrats on the deal Dusty Mike and Rod. So a lot of information provided Mike. And maybe if I could just parse it a little more Rod you were kind enough  and Dusty you were kind enough to give the numbers from 2019 20 and 21 for ULT. How much  if I see from 2020 through 21 there is a significant jump. How much of that is COVID related And I guess to the extent that you can what was the expected growth trajectory of ULT versus if I may consider organic BioLife everything that is nonULT as you looked at the company I guess what Im just trying to understand is is ULT faster growing than what your BioLife was originally,Positive
I think in the nearterm Suraj the answer to that is yes. I think that the organic growth that we would look at is again in that sort of 25 to 30 range excluding Stirling. And so there is going to be a bump in the Stirling revenue this year in part related to COVID but also in part related to just an increase in demand. And we do expect that increase in demand irrespective of any future COVID activity to continue. And so therefore therell be a significant contributor and we expect them to grow at that  at the lower end of that range.,Positive
Got it. And Rod for ULT this would be a pointofsale model not a recurring revenue base correct for ULT,Positive
Thats correct.,Negative
And you guys are not comfortable at this stage sharing the incremental contribution from COVIDrelated revenues right,Positive
Correct.,Positive
Okay. Fair enough. Rod I know this has been beaten to death. Maybe Ill just belabor it a little more. Since 2019 you all have made a determined strategy to acquire a bunch of companies. And gross margins of the different businesses when you look at the composite gross margins they have taken a hit. When you will integrate ULT this thing needs to reverse pretty significantly from 30 to 55. Maybe you can give us some additional color. Im just going to piggyback on the prior persons question. Give us some color what gives you the confidence level in the midterm you can turn the tide around to get to an adjusted 30 EBITDA margin,Positive
So again its driven by two things. One is that the current Stirling gross margins are in the low 30s right And those are expected to expand to the mid to high 40s which would then at that point give an overall blended  again were looking in the crystal ball a bit. So it depends on how much of the revenue is comprised of media thaw etcetera. But the point being that if they get into the mid to high 40s then the blended gross margin for the company would be somewhere in the mid50s okay. It could be a little bit better but thats what we are thinking now. And so when you then adjust out all the things that we adjust out we feel very strongly that we can attain the 30. And if you recall Suraj the narrative for the last 18 months for BioLife has been that yes we recognize that the tradeoff was to remain a one product pony that had a great margin profile but had serious risk with respect to customer order patterns and perhaps ultimate customer growth right And so we wanted to mitigate that by embarking on the acquisition strategy we did fully understanding that in the nearterm and thats defined as 12 to 24 months from the time we started that strategy we would have declining margins until the point where the revenue scale and now my stated goal of 250 million. At that point in time we are very comfortable talking about a 30 adjusted EBITDA margin that has mid50s gross margin associated with it.,Positive
Got it. Hey Mike one last question for you. The evo commercial win would love to get additional color on that Is  should we  would we be too far off in thinking about the two commercial  key commercial players that youll have bagged at least one of them maybe on a different product line,Positive
Yes. Good question Suraj. I think rather than answer that directly I think Ill just refer to our previous response which is this company understands how material important this is significant this would be for us to be able to disclose the relationship. Were not quite there yet working through their multilayer approval process but Im confident perhaps at some point we will get that approval. But before then out of respect for relationship were just not going to disclose the name.,Positive
Got it. Gentlemen thank you for taking my questions.,Positive
Thanks Suraj.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason McCarthy of Maxim Group. Your question please.,Positive
Hey this is Michael Okunewitch on the line for Jason. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the announcement seems like a pretty big add to your overall business. But Id like to ask a bit generally. You invested pretty heavily into the Ultracold freezing and the cold chain logistics. So Id like to touch on what you anticipate to be the key drivers for growth in this business area Obviously COVID19 kind of thrust Ultracold chain into the public consciousness but its really  its just the first mRNA vaccine a lot more in the pipeline. So what are the areas where you expect to really drive growth in this respect,Positive
Yes Michael good question. I think in a nutshell sticking to our knitting within cell and gene therapy its going to be about the pace of approvals right. So we all know the ARM data. We know how many clinical trials are out there. Weve now been really clear about our estimates of how many clinical trials our media is used in. I articulated on the call in my remarks a little earlier today that we believe that the decision by this large pharma company to split off their commercial shipments and to award parts of the business to more than one logistics partner and to use more than one container. So they have got some risk mitigation. We believe will be the norm over the next few years. So it wont be a winnertakeall scenario and we are really I think strongly configured to compete into take a decent amount of share of those shipments. So in a nutshell its really going to be about the pace of approvals and then our ability to see the evo adoption increase based on this key win and also through the great work that our courier partners are doing.,Positive
Alright. Thank you. And then I have one more on the actual Stirling freezers themselves. So how does the energy requirement compare for Stirling versus a more traditional compressorbased freezer And how does that kind of translate into operational cost savings,Positive
Yes great question. Dusty why dont you take that one,Positive
Yes. I think to frame it out Michael the basis of our savings which is an energy star rating an important element in terms of the strategy that the business was born roughly about 10 years ago. And what that does it provides a material benefit as it compares to our compressor systems anywhere between 10 and 50 less energy being used. So when you start to think about the application of our freezers versus a traditional compressorbased freezer the infrastructure that many of our partners have realized is the fact that they can eliminate a lot of HVAC i.e. more cooling to offset some of the heat but also they are getting a material benefit associated with the less energy use. And when you start to multiply that especially with multiple different systems there is a significant benefit that many of our customers are parenting by virtue of using the Stirling freezer system.,Positive
Alright. Thank you. And I just want to ask one more if you dont mind. How does the target use case vary for the Stirling Ultracold that that 80  that 20 to 86C range compared to the CBS nitrogen based,Positive
Go ahead Dusty,Negative
Well I think there is two applications that basically cover the entire cold chains here Michael. So when you start to think about minus 20 to minus 86 our system unlike any compressor a system can be tuned to any temperature between those respective temperature ranges. So we basically cover every single temperature point between minus 20 and minus 86. And traditionally when you take a look at the workflows especially in the end markets that Mike and Rod talked about there are a lot of biological materials that basically are mandated to support that in addition to the vaccines that are more prominent with regards to the temperatures that we just highlighted. When you start to think about the even colder temperatures so the deep temperatures a key temperature point of course is minus 135C. At minus 135C thats the glass transition temperature. Mike noted this in terms of the fact that biological activity is stopped. And typically this is the temperature range in which cell and gene therapies are most noted to ensure that that biologic coactivity especially when it gets to researchers and the cell and gene therapies that are being developed ultimately meet the efficacy requirements that are being driven from the manufacturers. So those two temperature ranges basically are all focused on biological material but each of those respective temperatures provides a biological benefit that customers use in the markets today whether that be clinical trials cell and gene therapy biobanking etcetera. And the fortunate aspect that we have here is combining those two now we as Mike said cover the entire cold chain temperature range thats ever so critical for every single biological material in the world today.,Positive
Alright. Thank you very much.,Positive
Thanks Michael.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Flaten of Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.,Positive
Hi good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions.,Positive
Hi Thomas.,Positive
Just a quick one on SciSafe during the last quarterly call there was a suggestion there was some upside to that 2.7 million COVID deal and youve obviously raised your guidance from 9 million to 12 million. Is that all COVID deal or is there other business expansion thats nestled in that increase in guidance,Positive
Yes. Good question. And probably just best to stick to our line that were just not going to talk about COVID revenues just based on the guidance we received from a bunch of federal agencies. So I would like to answer and give that kind of detail but its a little early for us to do that.,Positive
Sure. If you cant quantify it but if at least we could do kind of a qualitative answer. If you look  if you think about the Venn diagram of customer overlap I know there is some names that were thrown out during the prepared remarks. But could you help us understand what the overlap is in customers between Stirling and the legacy BioLife businesses,Positive
Sure. Somewhat qualitatively I can say that there are some customers that do use our media and also contract with SciSafe for storage. But I dont want to get into how many or who they might be.,Positive
Okay. Fair enough. And then Rod I was wondering if you could help us a little bit with how to think through the middle of the PL this year Obviously there is going to be a big change to the middle for the second quarter but could you help us think about because youre not going to be EBITDA  or sorry accretive until next year. Can you just help us think through what that looks like from a spending perspective,Positive
Well I think that  heres what I can say because we purposely chose not to give guidance below the revenue and a little bit of gross margin. Weve got a lot of moving parts. And so what I will say is that if you looked at the operating expenses for Q4 that while we may have somewhat of  some growth in 2021 based on both activity and just gearing up to become a larger entity its probably not going to be the same growth that you saw from 2020 to 2019.,Positive
Okay.,Negative
And thats ex Stirling right Thats just the BioLife at the end of the year kind of thing.,Negative
Understood. Understood. Alright guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions.,Positive
Thank you.,Positive
Thanks Thomas.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Marc Wiesenberger of B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.,Positive
Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the deal.,Positive
Thank you.,Positive
Im wondering if you could talk about the demand from nonvaccinerelated players in terms of biostorage And has there been maybe a rush to secure space with the increase in demand from vaccines,Positive
Yes. I dont think we want to go there Marc. I think were going to just going to stick right to it and say were just not going to give any granularity on SciSafe other than how Rod has articulated how were going to report that in 1 of the 3 buckets going forward this year.,Positive
Got it. Understood. In the prepared remarks you did talk about expansion in the U.S. and Europe related to Biostorage. Could you talk about maybe some color on the location and level of investment we can expect,Positive
Definitely not. Based on the guidance from the federal agencies there is one thing were definitely not going to talk about and that is where were going to be and what might be stored in those facilities. Wed like to but thats the guidance. So were going to respect that.,Positive
Okay. You made an interesting investment in December in PanTHERA CryoSolutions. Can you talk about what attracted you to that opportunity How their preservation media compares to the  your current formulation And with kind of worldwide marketing and distribution rights whats the strategic opportunity there going forward,Positive
Yes. Good one. Thanks for asking. So PanTHERA has a particular synthetic molecule that can inhibit the formation of ice on inside of cells during the freezing process which is really damaging. That whole ice formation and then water flowing out water flowing back in can cause the membranes to go crazy and rupture and then you have no cells left because they are dead. So this particular molecule that the Panthera folks have identified and gained access to could be seen as a potential additive to our CryoStor family of freeze media although we have to be clear that CryoStor works really really well.,Positive
So there could be some upside with certain cell types but nevertheless it could be something we would spike CryoStor with to make it work even better. But I think Marc think about this as an offensedefensive play. While we have the opportunity to help them finish the work and then to commercially exploit it we also have the opportunity to make sure that its not in anybody elses hands where they could simply spike a homebrew with this particular molecule and come up with something that might ultimately based on the performance disrupted as large CryoStor hold in the cell and gene therapy space. So we think we have total optionality based on how it goes and were looking forward to seeing how the rest of the experiments go.,Positive
Awesome. Great color. And then just one more for me can you talk about the expectations for the preservation media growth in the first quarter given that there was some pull forward last year at the onset of the pandemic and maybe just more broadly the cadence throughout the year for the respective business lines Thank you.,Positive
Yes. We dont  as you know we dont give any quarterly color. But Rod you can chime in if you like.,Positive
Yes. I mean the only thing I was going to say Marc really is that the Q1 is going to be a tough comp on the media side because we probably pulled in 1.5 million to 2 million in Q1 of 20 from the COVID which was then kind of trailed off throughout the rest of the year. So we did conclude that it was demand pull forward as opposed to some permanent safety stock on the part of our customers. So I think Q1 will be what it is but certainly on the media side its a tough comp.,Positive
Got it. Thank you very much.,Positive
Thanks Marc.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Knight of KeyBanc. Your line is open.,Positive
Thanks for the redo. Hey Dusty who are your competitors in your business,Positive
Paul weve got probably two primary competitors that Ill denote. I think Thermo is probably one and Panasonic is the second.,Negative
Okay. Where do you rank in share Do you know,Positive
I think share by geography is a little bit mixed. I would say that were hovering around the number two position in the market.,Positive
Okay. And then Rod I missed the breakout on the number on Astero for 4Q,Positive
Sorry,Negative
We lost you.,Negative
Yes. You broke up. Can you repeat,Positive
What was the Astero number in the CBS revenue for Q4,Negative
Okay. Astero was  let me find my commentary. Astero was 662000 and freezer business was 3.6 million.,Positive
Okay. Thank you very much.,Positive
You bet.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Carl Byrnes of Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.,Positive
Hey thanks for the question. Congratulations.,Positive
Thanks Carl.,Positive
With respect to Stirling in addition to the obvious COVID opportunity and considering the Stirling has been growing do you see any material opportunity from stockpiling related to contracts from DoD or other government energies like BARDA Thanks.,Positive
Yes. Well Carl if youre asking specifically to the COVID we wouldnt answer that if you mean just generally then definitely sure.,Positive
Fair enough thanks.,Positive
Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to CEO Mike Rice for closing remarks. Sir,Positive
Thanks Latif and thanks again everyone for your interest in BioLife. We are all really inspired to share this good news and BioLife is now even better configured for even more continued growth. We have a very strong team here that executes every day to satisfy our customers and the performance of this team is simply amazing. I wish all of you and your families good health and safety and we look forward to speaking with you when we report our first quarter results. Good night.,Positive

With that Ill turn the call over to Dave.,Positive
Thank you Leigh and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us. On todays call Ill provide a brief review of Iridexs 2020 progress where our business stands today and our fourth quarter and full year results. Then Ill touch on our continuing growth initiatives and outlook for 2021. After that Fuad Ahmad will provide additional color on our financial results for the quarter and the year. And then well open it up for calls and questions.,Positive
So clearly 2020 was an extraordinary and difficult year for many companies. At Iridex we saw our second quarter revenues fall by 40. But over the course of the remainder of the year with focus from the entire Iridex team we adjusted how we operate and indiscernible and ended 2020 delivering one of our strongest quarters in years. In addition we achieved several important milestones including launching improved products and enhancing our market position. And we exited the year with solid momentum that will help drive several exciting catalysts in 2021 and beyond. Im pleased to report that Iridex had a great fourth quarter. Despite continuing COVID impacts yearoveryear revenue increased by 5 to 12.3 million a multiyear quarterly high plus gross margin improved by 4 percentage points while operating expenses were reduced by 9 resulting in nearly breakeven net income.,Positive
Returning to the highlights of the progress in 2020. The year was of course dominated by managing and responding to challenges created by the pandemic. However we also continue to execute on our longerterm strategic objectives. First we implemented structural changes to reduce operating costs and preserve cash to extend our financial runway and the success of these measures allowed us to limit cash usage to only 1 million for all of 2020 we finished the year with 11.6 million in cash. Second we adjusted our sales and marketing processes to improve market awareness and expand adoption of our nonincisional MicroPulse Transscleral Laser Therapy or TLT engaging new customers and reengaging our significant installed base. We began the year launching our revised MicroPulse P3 probe then midyear successfully shifted to virtual and webbased sales activities supporting customers. Although midyear procedure volume declined significantly starting in April as offices and surgi center closures were strictest. We strongly recovered U.S. glaucoma probe volumes in Q3 and Q4 both exceeding 2019 preCOVID levels. And third we continued rolling out product enhancements that strengthened our competitiveness and improved gross margins.,Positive
We updated our TxCell scanning laser module launched both an updated and a new LIO delivery device and made substantial progress on our new lowercost laser platform receiving FDA clearance and readying the first of the family for launch in 2021. Our progress on these initiatives during the challenging environment in 2020 makes us very confident for 2021. Id like to take the next few minutes and share some additional highlights from the fourth quarter.,Positive
Top line revenue in the quarter exceeded the preCOVID revenue in the prior year period improving 5 to 12.3 million. Adoption of our Cyclo G6 probes reached a record quarter in the U.S. with 8 growth over 2019. Outside the U.S. continued impact from COVID restrictions caused small reductions in probe usage. In the fourth quarter we announced that our MicroPulse TLT has been included in the European Glaucoma Societys Terminology and Guidelines for Glaucoma. These new guidelines were presented at the Annual Society Meeting this past December. In addition 9 new MicroPulse TLT studies were presented exemplifying the continued global expansion and potential for this treatment. Were very encouraged by the results in the fourth quarter from our retina business as well which had been severely impacted in the third quarter down 23 versus the prior year. In the fourth quarter this segment rebounded strongly posting 11 yearoveryear growth. We expect this strength to continue in 2021 particularly as we execute the Topcon collaboration elements.,Positive
And finally were pleased with our success in fourth quarter managing our capital resources. Similar to the third quarter our webbased sales and marketing activities enabled us to limit operating expenses while at the same time exceeding revenue from the prior year.,Positive
Id like to briefly highlight our continued progress in product development circling back to the launch of our new laser indirect ophthalmoscope the LIO Plus in the third quarter. The positive feedback we received from our users following that launch has translated to adoption and strong order flow in the fourth quarter. We expect this enthusiasm to continue in 21 as the ophthalmic business landscape recovers from the deferrals and cancellations that resulted from COVID. We also have our new laser system platform well underway with the 810 system launching soon and the 532 and 577 frequency lasers expected later in the year.,Positive
In addition with the acquisition of the PASCAL scanning laser line we plan to combine the key features from PASCAL and our MicroPulse and TxCell products into a single leading platform.,Positive
Lastly let me recap the exciting strategic collaboration with Topcon that we announced just a few weeks ago via press release and a conference call both of which can be found on the Investor section of our website. Topcon is a Japanese based manufacturer and distributor with approximately 1.3 billion annual revenue in 2019 including 430 million from its global eye care business. This new collaboration enhances our value proposition on 3 fronts. First it provides significant additional capital to drive new growth initiatives in retina and glaucoma. Second it expands our distribution network throughout Asia Pacific and key EMEA regions Europe Middle East and Africa. And third it increases revenue and scale by combining Topcons PASCAL line with Iridexs MicroPulse and TxCell products creating leader in technology and in market share for retinal scanning laser products.,Positive
The transaction is expected to net 19.5 million in cash to Iridex. And this allows us to fund strategic growth initiatives such as expanded sales teams clinical studies and market development programs all designed to drive faster market adoption of our glaucoma therapy products. As part of the collaboration Topcon will assume exclusive distribution rights in Asia Pacific and key EMEA markets for both our retina and glaucoma products. In total this will account for approximately 60 of our international revenue and the remaining portion will continue to be sold through our current distributor network. In assuming exclusive distribution rights both Iridex and Topcon will benefit from a broader offering of diagnostic and treatment products for both glaucoma and retina customers.,Negative
And finally combining the acquired PASCAL product line with MicroPulse and TxCell platform products will result in a leading market share in the marketplace as well as a greater scale to generate design manufacturing and marketing efficiencies.,Positive
So in summary we believe our fourth quarter results demonstrate the momentum created by the hard work of the Iridex team over the past 18 months. Weve seen sales growth in retina thanks to new products and weve seen increased market uptake of our unique MicroPulse TLT glaucoma treatment all despite significant COVID headwinds. This gives us the confidence to increase our investments to grow both retina and glaucoma segments as we anticipate the ophthalmic market returning to normal as the year progresses.,Positive
With that Id like to turn the call over to Fuad Ahmed.,Positive
Thank you Dave and good afternoon everyone. I will now go over our financial performance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 starting with revenue.,Positive
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was 12.3 million up 5 from 11.8 million in the fourth quarter of last year and up 40 from 8.8 million sequentially. We sold 13500 Cyclo G6 probes in the quarter same volume sold in the fourth quarter of last year but up 18 over the 11400 probes sold in Q3. We saw probes volumes approaching the prepandemic levels with pricing levels at or above last year. We sold 57 Cyclo G6 systems in the quarter compared to 107 in the prior year period and 37 sold in Q3 of this year. The reduction compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the COVID related capital purchase deferrals by customers. However consistent with our sales practices for most of fiscal 2020 we have maintained good pricing discipline and saw our system pricing remain steady. In fact fourth quarter of 2020 saw a modest uptick in system pricing sequentially on higher volumes a positive indicator for fiscal 21.,Negative
Overall revenue from Cyclo G6 product family was 3.5 million although down 5 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 because of lower sales  system sales it was 25 improvement from 2.8 million in Q3 of 2020. Our retina revenue improved significantly in the fourth quarter and posted an increase of 11 compared to the prior year period and 56 compared to the third quarter.,Negative
To recap our retina products includes lasers various delivery devices which we define as capital equipment and endoprobes which are a singleuse per procedure product.,Positive
Results in our retina product line were helped by the release of improved products and capturing previously deferred capital equipment purchases by customers in light of improving COVID related outlook both in the U.S. and OUS. Other revenue which includes royalties services and other legacy products increased 3 to 1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was up 420 basis points to 45.4 compared to 41.2 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin improved significantly as a result of solid pricing discipline and improvements in manufacturing cost structure. As previously reported gross margin enhancements have been and will continue to be an area of focus for the company.,Negative
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 were 5.9 million compared to 6.5 million in the same period of the prior year a 9 decrease. The decrease was a result of our continuing efforts to reduce our operating expenses both in response to the pandemic and a careful reassessment of our cost structure during fiscal 2020. As a result of meaningful gross margin and operating expense improvements we reduced our net loss in the fourth quarter to,Negative
179000 or a net loss of 0.01 per share an improvement of nearly 1.4 million or 0.10 per share from last year.,Negative
We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of 11.6 million down approximately 1 million from the end of 2019 inclusive of the PPP loan. We are very pleased with our yearend liquidity despite an overall decline in 2020 revenue. Our recently announced transaction with Topcon further bolsters our liquidity and gives us additional resources to accelerate our growth plans while retaining our focus on prudent cost structure and revenue growth which brings us to guidance.,Positive
Given the continuing variability in product demand due to COVID combined with variability introduced by Topcon collaboration affecting revenue recognition sales transition effects and integration costs for the PASCAL product line Iridex cannot provide a meaningful financial guidance for 2020 at this time.,Negative
With that Dave and I would like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,Negative
Operator Instructions. Our first question comes from Jon Block of Stifel.,Negative
Jon Block,Negative
First question Ill just pick up Fuad where you left off. I know youre not going to give explicit 2021 guidance but it seems like the business has good momentum. You exited 4Q in a very strong fashion. When we just think about sequentially the 4Q to 1Q step down that Iridex has usually experienced its been a little bit balancing but maybe 10 or so 1 million 1 million in change. Is that the right neighborhood to be in Or are there any sort of maybe goalpost that you can put up when we think about  how do we think about that 4Q 20 to 1Q 21 sequential move,Positive
John its Dave. Thanks for joining the call this afternoon. Yes. Its  typically we do see a reduction from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The fourth quarter is often a big capital equipment purchase quarter. Probes also though experienced some reduction into the first quarter as health plan deductibles are met at the end of the quarter and people arent as aggressive in going to get procedures early on. So thats the typical profile. We did say were seeing continued momentum from capital equipment success in the fourth quarter. And I think relatively we can  you can anticipate that as well. And then its always backloaded on quarters for capital equipment. So we do have a couple of weeks left in this quarter and that can introduce some variability. But typically were comfortable with the more standard step function. Now that said we closed the transaction with Topcon and we are now manufacturing the PASCAL product line and anticipate some revenue from that product line added into the quarter as well.,Positive
Jon Block,Negative
Okay. Great. It was actually going to be one of my questions but you clarified that as I think about maybe a couple of quarter  sorry a couple of week contribution from PASCAL specific to your 1Q 21 results. Alright. And then Ill just pivot Ill stay within the PL. The gross margin I thought was certainly a highlight in the quarter mid40 range. I think one of the stronger results in several quarters in some time. How do we think about the gross margin cadence If I go back to the announcement with Topcon I think you said expect some maybe pressure earlier on in the year and then strengthening throughout 2021. So do we think about that mid40 range maybe taking a step back in the first half maybe still all in for the full year the mid40s is a good place to be,Positive
Yes. I mean I think thats generally the right way to think about it. I think as we talked about on our call when we announced the Topcon transaction. The first quarter or so is going to be somewhat choppy given the distribution move over to Topcon as well as the integration costs associated with taken on the PASCAL product line. So we expect going to be some compression on the overall corporate margin. And then as those integration costs trade ph away I think we feel like well get back to the more mid40s beginning in Q3 and then certainly into Q4. And I think just to kind of highlight what happened in Q4 really was really a function of higher revenue. So certainly there was more overhead absorption but also the company has been  and are working diligently over the last year or so to find efficiencies in the manufacturing processes. So those will obviously continue from that perspective but there is some overhang from the transaction side.,Positive
And just to add to that Jon that capital equipment is typically at a lower gross margin than disposables. And as weve added a chunk of capital equipment revenue on average thats a higher percent of revenue. So that just by itself will pull down a bit the total average gross margins for the company. Thats offset by obviously higher revenue that comes in as well. And as we continue to grow the probe business that should drive gross margins up. And as you said earlier its going to take a quarter or a couple of quarters to clean up the integration and get the overhead in line as well as operating costs. Were just starting to integrate and well have some opportunities to have a better view of where we can go as we operate for a period here.,Positive
Jon Block,Negative
Got it. And maybe last 1 or 2 for me. I mean Dave you mentioned  we saw in the press release a while ago but MicroPulse included in the European guidelines. I think on this call you also talked about maybe new papers that are out there. Is there anything that we should be able to look out for in 2021 opportunities with additional guidelines maybe even something here in the U.S. Or other critical papers that you expect on the come that could help drive greater adoption of G6,Positive
Well theres been a steady stream of papers at the various glaucoma focused meetings some relatively large samples. I think one quarter last year we highlighted a 400patient study by a group from Toronto or led by a group from Toronto. And those are the kinds of papers that have been coming out. I think the continued publication of evidence on the more moderate stage patients publications around experience with dosing profiles and the mechanics of procedures and outcomes associated with that those are the kind of things that investigators are working on right now. And one of the things that we want to focus on is expanding our support of appropriate clinical studies to give the medical community just a greater confidence in particular subsets of patient types specifically moderates and looking at concomitant procedures with cataract. Theres been some publications of that but a broader set of experience would be desirable. So we look for those kinds of things through the course of 2021.,Positive
Thank you. Im showing no further questions at this time. Id like to turn the call back over to David Bruce for any closing remarks.,Positive
Thank you operator. That concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for joining and we look forward to updating you on future quarters.,Positive
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude todays conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.,Positive

Id like to turn the conference call over to Graham Farrell of Harbor Access Investor Relations Advisors for Body and Mind. Please go ahead sir.,Positive
Thank you operator. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to Body and Minds fiscal Q2 2021 conference call. We are delighted to have you here. This call will cover Body and Minds financial and operating results for the fiscal quarter ended January 31 2021 along with a discussion of some of our recent highlights and goals for 2021 and beyond. Following our prepared remarks we will open up the conference call to a questionandanswer session. The call today will be led by Body and Minds Chief Executive Officer Michael Mills along with the Companys Chief Operating Officer Trip Hoffman and Chief Financial Officer Dong Shim.,Positive
Before we begin with our formal remarks I would like to remind everyone that some of the statements on this conference call may be forwardlooking statements. Forwardlooking statements may include but are not necessarily limited to financial projections or other statements of the companys plans objectives expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The Companys actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forwardlooking statements due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.,Positive
I will now hand the call over to Michael Mills. Please go ahead Michael.,Positive
Thanks very much Graham. Hello everyone and thanks for taking the time for an update on the progress weve made at Body and Mind over the last quarter and we look forward to discussing our second quarter of fiscal 2021 ending January 31 2021. Weve been looking forward to reporting this quarter as we consolidated almost all our managed revenue in reported revenue as a result of successful license transfers and do 100 owned subsidiaries of Body and Mind.,Positive
To preface our discussion Ill remind you that we are a U.S. GAAP issuer and we do report in U.S. dollars. Ill touch on the potential benefits of the U.S. GAAP reporting a little bit later in the call. Were pleased to report both record consolidated revenue of US6.31 million for Q2 which is a 300 record revenue growth for Q2 2021 compared to Q2 2020. Q2 showed a 19 sequential revenue increase over Q1 and Ill remind you that our reported income for the entire fiscal year 2020 were 6.23 million.,Positive
On a very conservative run rate basis that puts us at roughly 25 million run rate of revenue with any allowance for increased sales or new revenue from projects currently near completion. Well discuss our current projects later in the call.,Positive
A quick summary of our balance sheet. Total assets increased from 40.57 million to 41.44 million. Total liabilities increased from 7.19 million to 8.92 million. Total current assets grew from 6.53 to 7.31 million and total current liabilities grew from 4.81 million to 6.19 million. We ended Q2 with roughly 160000 less from the start of the period and finished the period with 1.61 million in cash. Again we have no long term or convertible debt and roughly 108.8 million shares outstanding as of March 16 2021.,Negative
Now Ill talk a little bit about some of our operational metrics. Our Q1 gross margin was 34 and weve improved gross margin to 43 in the second quarter as weve moved more revenue through our operations expanded sales and continued to control costs. We anticipate continued margin improvement going forward as sales of our first flower from extended cultivation in Nevada come online and we see increased sales through our dispensary operations. Were still in the growth stage with some of our assets which continue to ramp and were also spending cash developing new operations.,Positive
We all know COVID and lockdowns have been a real challenge for all businesses and now pretty much everyone. Were really looking forward to getting back to hosting some of our customer and brand events as COVID restrictions relax. We had some great success in the past with customer events and instore marketing initiatives and we see these opportunities starting to come on line as restrictions relax.,Positive
Were also seeing travel and tourism increase to our markets including Las Vegas San Diego and Long Beach. An additional operating metric we see as an improving trend is the declining cash used in operations with just over 100000 in cash used in operations over the quarter and roughly 420000 in cash used in investments over the quarter. We anticipate cash used in operations continuing to improve and turn to positive cash flow as we move further into fiscal 2021.,Negative
Our adjusted EBITDA for Q1 was roughly 57000 and our adjusted EBITDA for Q2 increased to 0.66 million. We look forward to increasing our performance metrics as we continue to move more revenue through our lean infrastructure.,Negative
In addition to record financial results Id like to welcome Alexis Podesta to the Body and Mind Board. Alexis is the past California Secretary of State for Business Consumer Services and Housing and her agency was the lead in creating the legislation to transition California cannabis industry for medical to adult use. In 2016 the California cannabis market was 2.8 billion and in 2020 the industry grew to 4.4 billion. Projections for 2023 are in the 6.3 billion to 7 billion range. This is an important margin.,Positive
Over the past months weve seen numerous developments in cannabis legislation across municipal state and federal agencies and perhaps the most impact will be in the reintroduction of the SAFE Banking Bill into the House last week. The Bill has broad bipartisan support in the House of over 100 bipartisan cosponsors. The SAFE Banking Act was passed by the House in 2019 in a 321103 vote and is expected to go to the senate shortly.,Negative
While the current SAFE Banking language would not decriminalize cannabis on a federal level it would make the entire industry significantly more efficient and lead the way to lower cost to capital and potential access to U.S. capital markets both from a listing and investing opportunity.,Negative
As we think about developments around SAFE Banking we are getting prepared for the opportunity of U.S. listings for cannabis companies. Weve already seen some of the largest U.S. cannabis companies convert from IFRS accounting to GAAP accounting as well as register securities with the SEC. Again Body and Mind is a U.S. domiciled issuer and reports in U.S. GAAP and as we look forward to any change in U.S. banking legislation this has the potential to speeder transition to U.S. Exchange in the event the opportunity presents .,Positive
Looking forward our development team is actively finalizing Arkansas and Ohio and have additional development opportunities in the pipeline. We have license applications in progress and are working with local and state agencies on new and ongoing license applications. Were keeping a very close eye on states that are opening as well as limited licensed jurisdictions that are opening for applications in the near term. Our executive team has been evaluating numerous acquisitions through our topline revenue and EBITDA and are seeing very interesting opportunities.,Positive
Id like to turn the call over to Trip Hoffman our Chief Operating Officer to outline advances across our various operations.,Positive
Thank you Mike. Ill now provide a brief history and update on the operational facilities of Body and Mind. In Nevada we continue to operate a 100 owned 14000 square foot cultivation and production licenses that we began in 2015. In March of 2020 we completed construction and commenced operations of a new 7500 square foot production facility here in Las Vegas. This facility provides up to 10 times the capacity for more SKUs and more white label manufacturing opportunities.,Positive
In December 2020 we completed the construction of converting the space from the prior production location into an approximate 20 increase in our flower canopy capacity of the cultivation operation. Also in December 2020 we received our distribution license approval which allows B2B delivery of wholesale products and will provide overhead cost reductions for our wholesale operations. In March this month 2021 we completed the full utilization of our additional canopy space and we expect the sales going forward to reflect the new capacity.,Negative
Moving on to Ohio. In February of 2019 we began managing a medical dispensary branded as The Clubhouse at its opening. In September 2020 we completed the license transfer of the medical dispensary into a 100 owned Body and Mind subsidiary allowing full consolidation of financials. At the same time the business was rebranded from The Clubhouse to Body and Mind. In October 2020 we began construction of a medical production facility with about 4000 square feet capacity. We expect those production activities to begin next month.,Negative
In California in August 2019 we began management of a medical and adultuse dispensary branded as ShowGrow in Long Beach. In December 2019 we began production and distribution of Body and Mind branded products under our brand management agreement with an unaffiliated licensee. In April of 2020 we opened a 60 owned medical and adultuse dispensary branded as ShowGrow in San Diego.,Negative
In August 2020 we completed a license transfer of ShowGrow Long Beach dispensary into a 100 owned BaM subsidiary along full consolidation of the financials. And in January of this year 2021 we began home delivery service from our ShowGrow San Diego dispensary.,Negative
Moving on to Arkansas. In April of 2020 we began managing a medical dispensary branded as Body and Mind in West Memphis. That license also allows a limited cultivation and production on the same premises. Our management agreement we have in place provides a 67 share of the net profits. In October of 2020 we received the Best Dispensary in Arkansas award by Ark420.com.,Positive
In November of 2020 we began the operational setup for the medical cultivation. We expect that medical cultivation operations to begin in the next couple of weeks. And in January of this year in 2021 we began home delivery services from Body and Mind in West Memphis. And that completes the operational update.,Negative
Thanks very much Trip. If there are any questions out there please feel free to contact the operator and wed love to give you update now.,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,Negative
Thank you. Operator Instructions There are no further questions at this time you may proceed.,Positive
Operator do we have any questions there,Negative
It looks like we have one more question from Peter Wright with Introact. Peter your line is now open.,Positive
Great. Thank you guys for taking my question and congratulations on the fantastic results. Three questions if I can. My first question is on scale and if you think of the target model help us think about how youre thinking over the next 18 months. What are the numbers maybe on a top line level that you have to get to achieve your target model,Positive
Ive got three questions if I could throw them all out there if I can and we can along Mike. The second question I have is around branding. And what Im looking to get a better understanding of is as we transition from Clubhouse to Body and Mind or ShowGrow to Body and Mind what is really the implications economically that youre seeing from these transitions the good and maybe some of the challenges that you see in this brand change if there is any,Positive
And then the third question that I have is operationally as you get some exciting new features within the dispensaries delivery and the such what are some of the trends that you see being more of a full service dispensary maybe from an average basket size or a mix and ability to kind of guide product demand towards your proprietary product what are some of the benefits there as you get a more full operational model on these dispensaries,Positive
Thanks very much Tony ph. Im going to let Trip comment on the first couple of questions here. And I think we think let me talk to you let me talk a little bit about brand and when you have a disparate brand kind of like I think you have mentioned the Clubhouse in Ohio and moving that to Body and Mind I think every time we bring Body and Mind to the forefront in the form of dispensaries in the form of our products in the form of really everything that we have to offer we gain that much more interest across the broad market and its very interesting to see the change in Ohio from Clubhouse to Body and Mind in the sense that this is a brand and this is a group thats bringing opportunities from states that have been medical and then transitioned to adultuse for many many years. So I think obviously the Body and Mind brand we feel that it appeals to a very large broad group of people and bringing it into really every aspect of our business is key.,Positive
With respect to getting to some of the operational numbers that we had discussed earlier I might want Trip take that one and then circle back to other question.,Positive
Yes thanks Mike and thank you Tony. So as we think about how were going to meet our forecast for the next 18 months theres couple of drivers that dont include acquisition or starting up new businesses. Essentially we have our organic growth from the existing operations and we also have the expansion operations that weve discussed in the past the Ohio production plus the Arkansas cultivation.,Positive
So we do expect as I mentioned in my summary both of those new operations that come online very soon weve been involved with the state licensing authorities for inspections and things like that just recently and so were in a very good position we know that were very close to those. So we do expect those events to take place as planned. And then on top of that the organic growth starting with our 20 increase in capacity here in Nevada and then following that up with all the dispensaries with extremely strong demand as everyone else is seeing across the country as the adoption of the use of cannabis just keeps  continues to grow we do expect to see something along the lines of a 30 yearoveryear growth just from our existing operations but it could be slightly more than that but thats from where we are.,Positive
In addition to that the third way of our top line growth and what we talk about internally is that we are always looking for new opportunities whether theyre bolton opportunities for other dispensaries or other operations or starting up new license applications across the country in different jurisdictions that we are very fond of. And we continue to work that very diligently. We do expect to have some things that will be coming out that we can make public here in the next quarter or two but its a fast and furious pace of activity on that front right now.,Positive
Ill turn it back to Mike for a minute.,Negative
Peter did that answer all your questions,Negative
He may have dropped off. He did have one other question Mike I will just touch on regarding dispensary trends and what were seeing across the country basket size and such. So just to speak generally on dispensary basket size and the number of customer tickets per day varies greatly from location to location. It will vary from as low as 60 per average ticket to as high as 140 per average ticket depending on if youre in one of the blue collar communities versus a more affluent community and likewise your number of tickets can also be dependent upon the amount of competition around.,Negative
In each of our stores that we are seeing significant growth on both the average ticket size and on the number of tickets per day the number of tickets per day that is an easy one just as we get more market footprint in new areas and as we keep pushing on our marketing efforts which we are really pushing a new digital marketing campaign effort this year for all of our operations that includes not just the digital online presence but also social media strategy and the like. And we are already seeing tremendous responses from that effort we expect that to continue. But generally we do expect the trends to continue to grow with the number of tickets and the basket size depends upon how wholesale prices fluctuate from place to place as well as the competition in nearby areas and we do see them holding strong as well right now.,Positive
I might just add we had such great success in the past with our outreach programs that are directed at the dispensary level getting to know budtenders getting to know managers at dispensaries running what we would call popups where we have a Body and Mind representative go into various dispensaries and showcase our products and interact with budtenders interact with customers. We havent been able to do that really for the last year or so and we know that thats a very effective program for us when people try our products they like them. So were really looking forward to get back into that routine.,Positive
And as I mentioned in California we used to run Cozy Sesh concert series at Long Beach something that we had looked to bring to San Diego. Thats a great way of building a customer base interacting with your customer but also bringing some of the brands in and letting them interact with your customers. So a lot of these marketing channels and when you think about cannabis and being able to reach customers a lot of the standard advertising that a CPG company would use. It is just not available to cannabis companies. So you have to be very strategic with your social media which were being but this personal touch and the ability to really have those conversations with your customers and your budtenders with your buyers is incredibly important. Were really looking forward to that opening up again.,Positive
Thank you.,Positive
Welcome.,Positive
There are no further questions at this time you may proceed.,Negative
Great well thank you very much for everyone for calling in and listening to this earnings and I would encourage anyone to reach out directly if you have specific questions. I would like to say that these record results that weve brought forward are a huge team effort and I would really like to thank everyone on the Body and Mind team our investors and the people whove supported us to get here. Thanks very much.,Positive
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.,Positive
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Guild Holdings Company Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Operator Instructions As a reminder this call will be recorded.,Positive
I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Kim Investor Relations. Please go ahead Michael.,Positive
Thank you and good afternoon everyone.,Positive
Before we begin Id like to remind everyone that comments on this conference call may contain certain forwardlooking statements regarding the companys expected operating and financial performance for future periods. These statements are based on the companys current expectations. Actual results for future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements due to a number of risks or other factors that are described in greater detail under Risk Factors in Guilds Form 10K and 10Q and other reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally todays remarks will refer to certain nonGAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of nonGAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in todays earnings release we filed with the SEC as well as on Guilds Investor Relations website.,Positive
Participating in the call today are Chief Executive Officer Mary Ann McGarry President Terry Schmidt Chief Financial Officer Amber Elwell and Chief Operating Officer David Neylan.,Negative
Now Id like to turn the call over to Mary Ann McGarry. Mary Ann,Positive
Thanks Michael and good afternoon everyone. I wanted to start by acknowledging all of Guilds employees for their ongoing efforts and contributions throughout what was a remarkable year. Without their hard work and dedication we would not have been able to report the levels of growth and success we achieved in 2020. Id also like to thank all of our clients for their continuing trust and business. Guild is more than just marketing and market share. We build longterm relationships with our clients and drive more sustainable growth across cycles. And finally we remain focused on driving longterm value for our existing and prospective shareholders.,Positive
Im going to spend a few minutes discussing our differentiated platform and how we are prepared to drive consistent growth and profits as the interest rate environment shift. Terry will walk through how Guild is positioned for sustainable growth. Amber will discuss our financial results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2020 and we will then be joined by Chief Operating Officer David Neylan for QA.,Positive
For 2020 we generated exceptional results across originations revenue net income and adjusted net income reinforcing the strength and differentiation of our business model. Consistent with other mortgage lending providers Guild benefited from historically low interest rates driving record refinance activity across the industry last year. Unlike some peers we remain well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable and profitable growth across cycles reinforced by our 60year track record.,Positive
At the core our business model is focused on purchase lending which historically has delivered more durable volume and higher returns on average versus refinancing activity across interest rate cycle. For the fiveyear period from 2016 to 2020 purchase loans accounted for 64 of our total originations. And looking ahead according to Februarys forecast the Mortgage Bankers Association forecast purchase originations to increase 10 in 2021 while refinancing originations are expected to decline yearoveryear.,Negative
Next our origination strategy centers on the retail channel where borrowers interact directly with our loan officers throughout the client lifecycle. It is this personalized and local mortgage borrowing experience that engenders client trust and brand recognition and more favorable unit economics over time. Finally our scaleenabled servicing business generates a recurring stream of cash flows helps to extend client relationship and works as a natural hedge during rising interest rate environment.,Positive
So with that Id like to turn it over to our President Terry Schmidt. Terry,Positive
Thanks Mary Ann. As Mary Ann mentioned Im going to discuss in greater detail how Guild is positioned for growth as well as some of our key strategic initiatives. To start I think its important to highlight our proven track record of growth across different interest rate backdrops. Since 2007 origination volumes have compounded at an annual growth rate of 28 while our market share has grown by 13 times and most importantly Guild has maintained profitability every year since 2008.,Positive
We operate in a large and fragmented market with the top 10 lenders in the retail channel capturing approximately 22 of total originations in 2020. Within the broader market we remain wellpositioned to continue to gain share with our constant focus on firsttime homebuyers. Our digital capabilities combined with our local presence in MSAs with favorable demographic trends complement our strategy. According to the U.S. Census Bureau around 45 million people will turn 34 the average age of firsttime homebuyers within the next decade.,Positive
We view our retail focus distribution approach as a key differentiating factor particularly in a rising interest rate environment. We have built a scalable robust infrastructure and a strong reputation while maintaining a local relationshipdriven model that can deliver a personalized client experience. We remain focused on organically growing our business in existing MSAs and entering new markets by recruiting new loan officers to our platform. Through 2020 annual loan officer headcount growth excluding acquisitions has averaged 7 since 2007 and we maintain high retention rates with existing loan officers generating more than 80 of our overall volume in the past five years through 2020. In addition to adding new loan officers we can further enhance growth by increasing the productivity of our existing loan officers through our ongoing coaching programs and system enhancements.,Positive
Next our scale and technology remain key competitive advantages that enhance operational efficiencies and improved profitability and we are increasingly leveraging our proprietary endtoend tech stack in a variety of ways. From a prospecting perspective we can analyze proprietary data to identify lead generation opportunities.,Positive
Turning to production and fulfillment we can provide a digital point of sale experience to our clients with online application automatic verification alerts and electronic closings allowing us to serve our clients as they prefer. Once on board our platform is designed to anticipate client activity which enhances servicing and retention. Refinancing opportunities are delivered back to the loan officer that originated the loan which improves the client relationship and increases portfolio retention. This is evidenced by our likelihood to recommend score of 94 and our refi portfolio retention of 66 for 2020.,Positive
Finally assuming interest rates continue to rise market dislocations often provide openings to enhance growth organically through opportunistic acquisitions. Focusing on MA we remain committed to expanding our presence in existing MSAs and into new territories through targeted and accretive transactions. And while past does not necessarily prologue origination volumes for companies that we have acquired increased by nearly 40 on average in the thirdyear following acquisition as businesses increasingly leveraged our scaleenabled platform to accelerate growth and realize operating efficiencies.,Positive
Ill now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Amber Elwell to discuss the financials in more detail. Amber,Negative
Thanks Terry. Im pleased to again report strong financial results for Guild Holdings Company. For the full year 2020 we generated 35.2 billion of loan origination representing 62 growth yearoveryear. Net revenue totaled 1.6 billion up 128 from 713 million in 2019. Net income totaled 371 million while adjusted net income which excludes the change in fair value of MSRs due to model inputs and assumptions acquisitionrelated contingent liabilities and stockbased compensation was up 277 yearoveryear to 524 million primarily driven by strong growth in origination volume reflecting our purchasefocused retail channel model and differentiated technology platform.,Positive
For the year GAAP EPS totaled 6.18 while we reported adjusted EPS of 8.73 for 2020. We finished 2020 on a particularly strong note with fourth quarter originations reaching 10.6 billion an increase of 75 over 6 billion for the yearago period. Following suit total net revenues were up 77 yearoveryear to 454 million with adjusted net income up 222 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. GAAP net income totaled 78 million while adjusted net income totaled 90 million. For the fourth quarter of 2020 GAAP and adjusted EPS came in at 1.30 and 1.49 respectively.,Negative
Next I wanted to spend a few minutes walking through gain on sale margin. Based on total origination volumes our gain on sale margin came in at 436 basis points for the fourth quarter up 67 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 but down from 552 basis points in the prior quarter. Our gain on sale margin on pullthrough adjusted lock volume was down 7 basis points to 482 basis points compared to 489 for the third quarter of 2020 and remained among the highest of our public company peers.,Negative
The margin compression on a sequential basis largely reflected normalizing spreads as supply and demand trends converge and competition for refinancing activity remains intense. We believe Guild remains well positioned to continue to generate strong gain on sale margins both on an absolute basis and relative to our public company peers in light of several key drivers.,Positive
First the MBA Forecast industrys originations next to increasingly favor purchase volume as the interest rate cycle turns boding well for our purchasefocused model. While purchase originations represented 44 of our total origination volume in the fourth quarter of last year over 64 of our originations were from purchases during 2016 to 2020 as Mary Ann mentioned earlier and we have a proven track record of profitable growth across interest rate cycles. Second channel mix matters our scaleenabled retail channel enables higher gain on sale margins relative to other companies that captured lower margin wholesale channel to drive growth. Third while we have continued to capitalize on outside refi volumes our refinance business model is different. Given our purchase focus we are not dependent on refinance activity to drive growth in originations going forward. Moreover while the refinance business is largely commoditized we compete on service not price and leverage our longstanding relationships with existing clients.,Positive
Our servicing business is another key differentiating factor that helps us to deliver sustainable growth across the variety of market and interest rate backdrops. First we are scaleenabled provider with a 60 billion servicing portfolio as of December 30 2020 up 22 from a year ago. In turn total loan servicing and other fees increased by 16 yearoveryear to 44 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. Furthermore most of our growth has come through the retail channel clients established relationships with our loan officers during the origination process which are further strengthened through servicing activities. So when clients are looking to refinance down the road our loan officers are well positioned to capture that business and this has reinforced by a refinance recapture rate which remained strong at 65 for the fourth quarter.,Positive
In the nearterm we continue to monitor the forbearance impact under the Cares Act. Our forbearance request represented 3.5 of our overall portfolio as of the end of 2020 compared to 5.5 for the industry based on MBA data. Our balance sheet remained strong and highly liquid with 335 million of cash and cash equivalents excluding funds used to pay down our warehouse lines as well 2.1 billion of outstanding warehouse lines of credit with unused capacity at 0.9 billion as of December 31 2020.,Negative
We are very focused on capital allocation as a team and with our board. Capital allocation priorities include funding origination ongoing reinvestment in the business and capitalizing on strategic and accretive MA opportunities with an overriding focus on optimizing returns on investment and driving longterm value for shareholders.,Positive
Finally I wanted to provide an update on the first quarter. As we have previously stated we dont intend to provide forwardlooking guidance. Given the date on which the earnings release fell on the calendar this year we wanted to share actual loan origination volumes for the first two months of the year. This totaled 6.1 billion for January and February of 2021 exceeding the 5.7 billion we generated in the entire first quarter of 2020. Based on these first two months through February total pullthrough adjusted lock volume was approximately 6.4 billion. This trend has softened a bit more recently and yeartodate gain on sale margins based on pullthrough adjusted lock volume were relatively in line with the fourth quarter of 2020 and ahead of the first quarter of 2020 at 302 basis points.,Negative
We anticipate an industry refinance volume to pull back and gain on sale margins to normalize as interest rates rise. Longterm our differentiated purchasefocused business model and strong retail distribution platform combined with our proprietary technology position us well to continue to deliver profitable growth regardless of interest rate cycles.,Positive
And with that well open up the call for questions. Operator,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,Negative
Thank you. Operator Instructions Our first question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.,Positive
Yes. Amber thanks for the volume numbers for January February. I might have missed it but did you say something about gain on sale for January Feb,Positive
Yes. Thanks Don. For gain on sale for January and February our pullthrough adjusted lock volume was 6.4 billion. And gain on sale was relatively in line with the fourth quarter 2020 on pullthrough adjusted lock volume which was 482 basis points.,Positive
Got it okay. Thank you. And I guess one question I have on the expenses is if you look at production expenses as a percentage originations this quarter versus Q3 they went up quite a bit yet the volumes didnt move up as much. And then can you sort of talk a little bit about that dynamic and how we should think about it going forward,Positive
Sure. I think the focus really should be on the full year. When you look at our expenses as a percent of revenue were at 57 for the full year of 2020 compared to 78 in 2019 and overall our expenses for the year were at 285 basis points compared to 297 for last year. And our origination segment ended at 218 basis points in total profitability for the year compared to 84 basis points in 2019. So there are some timing differences but I think focusing on the full year is really the best way to think about it and to get some of that timing difference out from quartertoquarter.,Negative
Okay. Thank you.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.,Positive
Thanks everybody for taking my questions this afternoon. First what percentage of the UPB was retained this quarter and what was sold,Positive
On the retain percentage for the quarter was about 95.,Negative
Got it. And the way our model is sort of looking at the numbers were seeing the CPR on the portfolio of about 50 during the quarter does that seem right Are we in the ballpark there,Positive
On an annualized basis yep that was around 48 in for payoffs and the CPR in the model that were using for the year as of December is 18.,Negative
Got it okay. And then what drove the increase  the sequential increase in servicing expenses that was sort of changed trajectory is that onetime or should we see that as a new run rate going forward,Positive
There was some onetime expenses in there on from a Cares Act perspective for our foreclosure loss provision as some of the  we looked at the moratorium and the rules and regulations changing around that and the length of foreclosures would be increasing cost. So I would consider that more of a onetime although our cost of service is a little bit higher just as weve had to prepare for staffing to work through all of the Cares Act forbearances this year and then continuing into next year.,Negative
Got it. And then last question. And I apologize for so many but Im just sort of try to put a finer point on Dons question. When we think about the timing differential between originations pullthrough adjusted lock and compensation expense help us think about that relationship is what we saw in terms of the fourth quarter origination or expenses a function of third quarter volume or is there a better alignment and that as we sort of move through the year that will help us get the models trued up,Positive
Yes good question. I think the focus really is the thinking of that on a straightline basis for the year more than looking at the quartertoquarter. There is not any trailing expenses that would roll and it would be aligned so I think focusing on the full year of where we ended at 2020 for the expenses and looking at 2019 as well obviously everyone knows 2020 was an anomaly year overall with margins and expenses as well. But I  the fullyear impact expenses to me is the way to think about it.,Positive
Got it. Yes understood. But certainly we get that and we appreciate that but at the same time people are looking at quarter so understanding how that correlation is going to be important going forward especially in an environment where were likely to see sort of a divergence between locks and fundings and some inflection there as well,Positive
Sure. We do compensate certain members of our management team based on business performance and growth in both volume and profitability which resulted in higher payments to some key employees in the fourth quarter. And so when you think about straightlining it takes out some of that variability and as well as when volumes and overall revenue and profitability goes down that would shift accordingly.,Positive
Got it okay. So some of this we hear and true up related to management compensation,Positive
Yes.,Positive
Okay thats all. Thank you.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Giuliano Bologna with Compass Point. Please proceed with your question.,Positive
Well thanks for taking my questions. Thinking about your balance sheet for a second is there a sense of how much cash you have in your different warehouse lines that are kind of paying down warehouse lines thats kind of in excess liquidity And just to get a sense of what your general kind of liquidity position is on a pro forma basis,Positive
So at the end of the year we only had 16 million that was in our warehouse paved down and the rest of it was sitting in cash and we were about 33 leveraged on our MSR debt overall. And so the operating cash at 335 million is the majority of our cash with just a little and the pay down and we continue to make sure that were focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position as we always have and are poised to handle any changes in the market going forward.,Negative
I just wanted to...,Positive
Yes to Ambers point. This is Terry. The third quarter our MSR outstandings was much higher. What was the number Amber it was around 50 of the collateral value and we bought it down to 32 33. So that was another change in the cash position.,Positive
Yes. Yes it was up 52  around in the third quarter.,Positive
Thats great. And I guess pivoting a little bit from there you obviously have a very large liquidity position. Im curious how to think about that liquidity position since  are there any potential acquisition candidates out there that makes sense or how does the pipeline look at the moment And then from there how do you think about a maximum amount of liquidity or when you might entertain capital return,Positive
Yes I can talk about our cash position...,Positive
I want to  okay talk about it sounds good. Go ahead Amber.,Positive
Overall go ahead.,Negative
Go ahead.,Positive
We think about our liquidity looking at operating reserve at CG capital so whether we need to run the business based on bank covenant requirements and then market risk associated with forbearance advances that sort of thing margin calls. And then to your point any strategic capital that we would need for investing back in our business and investing in the business is really  that remains our top priority. And as it relates to excess capital beyond these needs well continue to discuss potential capital return options with our Board.,Positive
On your acquisition question. Last year there wasnt a lot of activity just because of the volume that all the  everybody in the industry was handling. And but keep in mind that over 50 of the industry is coming and the volumes coming from independent mortgage bankers so we believe theres still great opportunity and were seeing a lot of IMBS that are kind of really thinking maybe its time to cash in their chips kind of sort of speak. So were seeing activity more activity the pipeline of sellers is growing and the key is going to be just getting to the right valuation point and were always good stewards of capital so were very careful about price considerations and want to make sure that anything that were considering will definitely be reasonable.,Positive
Thats very helpful. Thank you and Ill jump back into queue.,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Trevor Cranston with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.,Positive
Hi thanks. Couple of questions related to the MSR portfolio so maybe help us think about prepay speeds looking forward and the ability to generate refi volume from recapture. Can you share any data with respect to the servicing both in terms of the overall weighted average coupon or sort of the portion of the servicing book that you would estimate kind of still has a significant incentive to refi mortgage rates up around 3.25 or so,Positive
Sure. Ill start with that and then David can jump in on the refi retention. So overall our weighted average coupon is 3.6 for our portfolio. And we have like I said its indiscernible. So and then a multiple of 2.7 ending at the end of the year. And then David if you want to talk about what is the money based on your analysis.,Positive
Sure. Thanks Amber. So just a couple of things in 2020 we actually doubled the amount of close volume that came from our portfolio from 5 billion in 2019 to nearly 11 billion in 2020. Market conditions were certainly favorable but also reinvestment in our technology and the ability to continue to look at the portfolio anticipate client refinance activity as well as new purchase activity really has positioned us favorably and thats helped to generate our 66 refinance recapture rate for all of 2020. This is an area that were continuing to invest in. We think that there is good opportunity going forward. As youve indicated rates are still low theres strong tailwinds but we also anticipate being able to identify when the market normalizes opportunity for that repeat purchase activity whether its borrowers buying up or buying down. And again were well positioned to take advantage of that regardless of the interest rate cycle.,Positive
And I would just add on David this is Mary Ann. I would just add that its probably going to start to be a little bit more cashout refi because in some markets the inventory is an issue to move up. So we are seeing  I bet thered be a lot more improvements remodeling that will be and we  salespeople our customers tend to come back to us.,Positive
Yes. That makes a lot of sense. Okay I think the rest of my questions have already been addressed. So Ill jump back into queue. Thank you.,Positive
Sure.,Negative
Operator Instructions Our next question comes from Derek Hewett with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.,Negative
Good afternoon everyone and thank you very much for the volume and margin data through February I think thats very helpful for investors. Most of my questions were already addressed but could you talk a little bit about the tax rate it looks like it was in the low 20s during the fourth quarter where there  what were the moving parts and then should we expect it to kind of normalize back to the mid 20s next year,Positive
Yes. The 25ish range is what we would expect for the regulatory changes.,Positive
And then what was causing the tax rate for the fourth quarter,Negative
There was a slight adjustment for a deferred tax asset that we just put on for the full year.,Positive
Okay all right. Thank you.,Positive
Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.,Positive

Thank you Millicent. Hello everyone. And thank you for joining our call today. 2020 was an extraordinary year with the pandemic impacting all walks of life and the macro economy. Yet it also brought opportunities expediting internet penetration causing a paradigm shift in online content consumption and presenting potentials for online concepts.,Positive
The past year we demonstrated strong resilience and agility a commitment to investment in content technologies and people as well as innovation in new products and services solidifying our position as Chinas leading Music Entertainment platform and allowing us to build a strong foundation for our music content ecosystem. We closed the 2020 on a very strong note and are excited about our next phase of growth along our journey to evolve into an allin one online music and audio entertainment destination in China.,Positive
First and foremost in the fourth quarter of 2020 both our financial and operational performance were solid. In particular our online music services maintained its momentum which is to rein 29 yearoveryear growth in revenues up from 26 in the third quarter. Specifically subscription revenues increased by 42 yearoveryear. This outstanding performance was driven by 40 yearoveryear growth of paying users fueled by our effective payroll strategy diversifying the bundle membership offering as well as continuous rising user retention rate. Before with 56 million online music paying users are paying ratio of 9 up from 6.2 a year ago we finished the 2020 ahead of the curve and are confident that this success will continue in 2021 and years to follow.,Positive
Online subscription revenues in the fourth quarter we are pleased to report that we record triple digit yearoveryear growth on advertising for two consecutive quarters. This impressive growth was driven by increasing asset inventory and improving eCPM across our music application portfolio in the form of splash screens and then as we plan to continue developing our overall brand awareness to engage a broader array of advertisers by initiating more creative advertising products such as immersive video app reward as an audio app.,Positive
Looking into 2021 as we continue to leverage our inhouse and Tencents renowned advertising shrinks and capabilities we expect another year of strong growth from advertising.,Positive
Moving next to content Ill continue the investment in procuring and developing content has provided our users with a rich diverse and endless choice of entertainment which has been a key driving force behind our success. Apart from comprehensive cooperation through tactical expansion and deepening penetration to further captivate the young demographic to continue promoting and pursuing trend setting genres from trend predictive models to Content procurement and promotion. We have significantly increased our copyrights coverage in new hit content which has continued contributed to the increasing engagement of our users.,Positive
In the fourth quarter our partnership with leading rap music labels GOSH and 404 Rapper we sold that in more rap music stream that by younger users as compared to the beginning of 2020. We also make notable breakthroughs in Chinese Asian style music total streams for which boosted over 100 billion on our platform in 2020. We also make significant progress in cultivating and promoting original music. Let me provide just a few examples. First the scale of our Tencent musician platform expanded rapidly. In the fourth quarter the number of participating Indian musicians on the platform grew over 100 yearoveryear and outstanding rates in the industry. In particular the number of exclusive Indian musicians was 14 times of that in the same period a year ago showcasing the recognition by Indian musicians of our capabilities in promotion platform support and well defined incentive programs.,Positive
Second the number of original songs uploaded reached over 1 million on Tencent musicians per platform by the end of 2020 doubling the number compared with a year ago numerous original proper songs were incubated on the Tencent musician platform such as story of Indiscernible. Our industry influence was significantly amplified by Huangshi was enlisted by CCTV Spring Festival Gala.,Negative
One of the worlds most watched TV programs with more than 1 billion viewers for years performing his signature song Indiscernible. These are great examples of what we can do. Using our prestigious industry know how as well as in depth insights and data mining abilities to foster and grow original music.,Positive
Third we are proud to share that during the past year we have dedicated even more financially to the size of the business which enable over 60 of musicians to more than double their income. Such support will continue in 2021 contributing to a win win situation for everyone.,Positive
Finally on our Tencent musician platform Im very proud to say that we deeply care about diversity and we are doing our past to promote gender equality our support of female artists and musicians traditionally a minority in the music industry has led to female musicians accounting for nearly 40 of total artists on Tencent musician platform as of the end of 2020. This is significantly higher than the industry average of around 20 according to the 2020 China musician report.,Negative
Our music content leadership has been further cemented by strengthening partnerships with leading music labels and artists. For example recently and ahead of the schedule we extended a multiyear strategic licensing agreement with Warner Music and expanded our in depth cooperation for forming a joint venture record label in China in future we have confidence to continue to showcase new generation artists to music lovers unlock intrinsic value of music in China and keep contribution to the prosperity and development of the music industry.,Positive
The next topic that I would like to discuss is the strategic policy of our longform audio and our initial achievement during the first year of investment. Before going into details I would like to outline the exciting opportunities the audio services market presents us with and how we can harness them to compete effectively and scale quickly.,Positive
Firstly this market has exceeded in China for decades with no clear significantly the yet market penetration remains extremely low. Second this fast growing market has various potential natural synergies with online news entertainment giving us a tremendous advantage over vertical players.,Negative
According to third party research data the audio market in China is projected to reach a massive user base similar to that of online music streaming over the next few years. With our massive user base and the complimentary nature of music and all those channels we are able to seamlessly convert our music uses to audio uses positioning us to emerge as significant player while ultimately accelerating the penetration of online audio in China.,Negative
Firstly our strategic alliances with prominent content partners such as the China literature and other content collaboration within Tencent Online Entertainment ecosystem will continue to empower us to offer a wide range of content quickly.,Negative
During the fourth quarter the number of licensed titles was up by 370 yearoveryear covering a broad spectrum of audio categories such as audio drama Chinese drama comedy parenting and history apart from the well of the literature. Fourth our twopronged approach to integrating with our muse applications as well as launching a standalone application is unique and allow us to effectively acquire users at low cost and scale up quickly.,Positive
For example we significantly increased our longform audio MAU penetration in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 14.6 from 5.5 for the full period of 2019. Such a hybrid model differentiates us from other payers at home and abroad.,Negative
Fifth our recent acquisition of Lazy Audio which is expected to be consolidated in the first quarter of 2021 will become another driver that will help us forge ahead in the pursuit of growth in the years to come. Our view on longform audio is strategic and long term. We believe that investment in content whether licenses audio books or podcasting PTC or UGC we improve user spend time spent user loyalty and eventually revenue per user. This is evidenced by the 20 credit show increase in average daily usage time spent in the fourth quarter. If you wish that nearly 10 million at year end of 2020 and is on track to double by 2021. Over the past few quarters we had a good start in monetizing our longform audio business who in fact is bundled offerings with our existing music streaming services and extract pricing for standalone audio memberships. With increasingly enriched content and growing users we will tap into the audio ads to unlock commercial value which will push our revenue.,Negative
We consistently ask ourselves what else we can do better to improve user engagement. In 2020 weve further expanded our coverage of a broader set of music usage scenarios integrating with smart speakers incar audio systems TV and making euros in the profit performance market. Although not yet included in our report online use MAUs during the fourth quarter of 2020 smart devices enjoyed a solid yearoveryear growth in user scale providing additional channels for users to consume more content and interact with us.,Positive
In summary we achieved a solid progress across our full business spectrum in 2020. In terms of scale industry leadership content diversifications monetization and innovation in particular our online music services with improving economies of scales and diversified revenue streams achieved the high quality revenue growth and margin expansion throughout the year.,Positive
In 2021 we expect the strong momentum of our businesses to continue and anticipate a faster revenue growth across the board compared to 2020. With that now I would like to turn the call over to Tony who will discuss other highlights and important areas of focus for our businesses. Tony please go ahead.,Positive
Thank you Cussion. Hello everyone. Apart from the key developments discussed by Cussion just now I will provide additional highlights for our online music services before I move on to the discussion of our social entertainment services. During the fourth quarter core users are increasingly engaged with our platform. Despite the sequential decline in music MAUs average daily time spent for users has increased. This is a result of our concerted efforts to enrich both music and audio content offering as well as the launch of innovative products features and services for Putong Community and TME Live.,Positive
Next I will elaborate more on these efforts. First as a pioneer in the music fan base economy our digital album performance continued to create new milestones becoming a vital distribution channel for musicians further distancing ourselves from peers in terms of promotional capabilities.,Positive
In the fourth quarter we released many digital albums such as volume 4 by LUHAN a wellknown trendsetting male singer THE ALBUM by BLACKPINK a top Asian female band and In My Thoughts by Zhang Yunlei a rising star as a singer and a Chinese comedian. JJ Lin released three digital releases on our platform including his fourteenth album Drifter Like You Do which topped multiple music charts on the first day of its release.,Negative
To explore new opportunities in the dynamic market we continue to transform and innovate the fan base economy in Chinas music industry. In 2021 we will continue to push the boundaries of our fan idle connections and lead industry innovation in areas such as digital album virtual benefits fan meetings offline events and merchandise sales.,Positive
Second in our relentless pursuit of enhancing the user experience we continuously upgrade our products with music as our home ground to make online music services more social visual and personalized.,Positive
In July 2020 we introduced Putong Community in QQ Music through which we foster cultural communities with useful and transmitting content and interactions. We have continued to make it more interactive and appealing which has led to consistent increases in MAU penetration rate and user retention in the fourth quarter. Our efforts also brought resounding endorsement from younger users with users in the teens and early 20s accounting for a larger proportion of Putong Community users higher than the present in QQ Music.,Positive
In December 2020 QQ Music successfully held Boom Boom Award a forum that encouraged young people to vote on what was popular in 2020 and offer a glimpse into the views on future trends. It attracted interactions from home and abroad generating 2 billion instances of social media bus driving active users in the Puton Community to a record high.,Positive
Fans Club sensational a new community focused channel introduced by QQ Music in the in the second quarter of 2020 also received strong recognition particularly among young users. This is evidenced by more than half of Fan Club users being in the teens and mid20s with total user timespan increasing 15 sequentially during the fourth quarter.,Positive
When it comes to video enrichment we continue to transform the conventional experience of music streaming. QQ Music created a video based music product by pioneering embedded MBs on music streaming page further catering to the needs of users for consuming music videos and bringing in a more immersive audio visual experience. As a result on a sequential basis VAUs for embedded MVs on streaming page grew over 70 and daily total time spent increased by 88.,Positive
With 10s of millions of songs available to be stream we continue to leverage our proprietary user insights and data analytics to provide users with more personalized experience which has led to a sequential increase in the proportion of streaming volume driven by recommendation.,Positive
Technologically we continue to shine in the world right now merits global song recognition technology competition in 2020. QQ Music was the winner in the audio fingerprinting category while QQ Musics predictive model broke multiple world records in the area of patents for prediction. Aided by these technologies we are able to improve our predictive capabilities on the popularity potential of music before a wide scale promotion. And in the fourth quarter we successfully discovered and promoted chart topping songs such as Wrongheaded Jimmy boy and Swallow Never Wet rest yet we shed.,Positive
Now lets turn to our social entertainment services which in general maintain a steady performance in the fourth quarter. While live streaming business continued to recover healthily post COVID19 WeSing delivered faster growth thanks to product enhancements to improve its competitiveness and monetization efficiency.,Positive
First let me discuss our online karaoke services. The year 2020 presented WeSing with challenges and opportunities. To take up and respond to competitive pressure we refocus and made effective adjustments to enhance and we think core and differentiated services that are music centric and socially interactive creating a fun and engaging platform that provides the best online karaoke experience.,Positive
We are pleased to see WeSings MAU bottomed out during the fourth quarter and user engagement has improved as active users increase in November December compared to September October and are turning increasingly loyal on WeSing platform making a good start going into 2021.,Positive
Our first UI design and short form video recommendation feed on the homepage rolled out in September 2020 continue to gain traction.

Our music centric live streaming services delivered healthy operating metrics. Besides active performance our robust content offering effective and targeted operational initiatives and personalized recommendations help drive sequential improvements in user retention in the fourth quarter of 2020. Were also pleased with the increasing user engagement as we roll it out diversified live streaming content and attractive performance in categories such as ACG Chinese ancient style in gaming.,Positive

Gross margin was 32.4 in Q4 2020 which was unchanged sequentially and about 1.7 compared to last year. The yearoveryear decrease was primarily due to increased investments in new products and the content offerings such as longform audio less rental apps in terms of brand new generation and increased revenue sharing space to strengthen our platforms to competiveness. Online revenue services continue to positively impact our overall module.,Negative
Now moving on to operating expenses. Total operating expenses for Q4 2020 were RMB1.7 billion and was 20 as a percentage of total revenue as compared to 90 in the same period last year. Selling and marketing expenses were RMB773 million up 50 yearoveryear. The increase was due to higher promotional spending and the use of acquisition defenses to strengthen our products competed lists and solidified our advantage in musical centric live streaming.,Negative
Higher costs associated with annual gala events such as community event racing gala also contributed to the increase. General and administrative expenses were RMB906 million up to 21 yearoveryear. The increase was driven by increased investment in RMB for product enhancement and the technological innovation such as longform audio racing international versions brand new car okay room net all leading to higher employee rated costs.,Negative

This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are ready to open the floor for questions.,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,Negative
Thank you Operator Instructions Your first question comes from Eddie Leung from Bank of America. Please go ahead.,Positive
Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Two of them quick questions the first one is about trust the proportion of songs you guys have moved across the paywall Do you feel we are reaching more of like a high level which we going forward is basically less easy to move an incremental number of songs to the paywall If not why not,Positive
And then secondly its very interesting that you guys are first I mentioned that about a user base on so called internet of things or devices right in car audio speakers etcetera. So could you give us an idea whether these users are basically the same users on your mobile app Or are we addressing a different set of user base Thank you.,Positive
Thank you for your question Eddie. In terms of paywall to the end of 2020 we are just over 20 in terms of our streaming share of content thats sitting behind the paywall. And we actually dont see there to be a ceiling in the near term. And we continue to expect that by the end of this year 2021. We continue to increase our paywall at a similar pace as the previous years which would take us to just over 30 by the end of the year. We wanted to note that in the fourth quarter our net ads deliver a very solid performance of over 4 million 4.3 million net ads. And when we continue to expect our net ads to be strong. In particular in Q1 we expect the net app in Q1 to be even stronger than Q4 driven by a very successful keywall strategy and our various marketing campaigns.,Positive
In terms of the second question on IoT theres actually a different user group we see that majority of them are nonoverlapping because its a different use case. People who listen to music on smart speakers or in car a slightly different MAUs and DAUs compared to the music platform. So effectively our IoT strategy is helping us broaden our user base. We note that while the MAU the online MAU saw a slight decline which is mainly attributable to a higher churn of noncore users.,Positive
But on the other hand our core users actually increased the level of engagement on our platform. And by that I mean if we look at the average daily time spent for our DAU which is more representative of our core users it actually increased yearoveryear. And thats a result of all the product enhancements that weve been investing over the past year such as long audio embedded MVs on streaming page Putong Community TME live etcetera. And its important to note that our reported music MAU figures do not include the IoT devices such as smart speakers in car and Smart TV and the IoT devices MAU actually record a strong double digit growth yearoveryear in the fourth quarter. And that presents additional opportunities for us which well share more in the future.,Positive
Great next question please.,Positive
Thank you. Your next question comes from Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead.,Positive
Hi morning management. Thanks for taking my questions. My question is related to your longform audio even the 15 penetration rate could you share more detail regarding the user profile and any overlap of the FEC music subscriber and also their content of interest. In relation to that can you also elaborate the various monetization model that you plan to push more aggressive this year Would that be more on the suspicion or would that be more on the on my app to drive the growth in 2021 Thank you.,Positive
Okay thank you so much for your questions. Actually the longform audio is a very important strategy. That for TME we are fully committed to invest in this area. I think this is a very natural way for TME to doing it because we have a very strong competitive advantages that compared to the other vertical player in the industry right now. First of all we seem that this is a very natural extension of music consumption. Because all a lot of our music users nowadays besides listening to music they will be more easily to be extended the time and then listening to more audio programs. So this is very easy for us to convert our existing users into the longform audio users.,Positive
So we will save the user acquisition costs in this aspect. Besides this we are seeing that we have already set up a lot of content partnerships especially with the very renowned company like the China literature that we have already set up the strategic partnership last year we also starting to team up with other content providers in the industry as well not just the professional content but we are also extending our footprint into the podcasting and also other UGC and PGCs area.,Positive
The third point that I would like to mention is for the TME long term audio strategies we are taking the two pronged approach which is unique in the industry which means that on one side we are going to leverage our music application to have a long term audio section on our apps. But on this other side we are also launching out our standalone longform audio application as well. And with the acquisition of the Lazy Audio team the news that we announced last year we actually further strengthen our strength on the standalone longform audio side. So I think that this is a very unique strategy and make us to stand out from the competitions in the industry. Beside this well also continue to pull in more financial resources. And also we have set up per team to working on the long form audio businesses. And Im sure that in the year 2021 is going to be another a huge step for us. And by doing this we strongly believe that the longform module will create a long term value to the entire group. First of all it will increase as Tony mentioned it will increase the user engagement because the time spent on a platform will be improving and also to be increasing because they will enjoy more and more content from our platform.,Positive
Secondly because of the different monetization model that we have for example we have the premium content monthly subscription model. We also have the advertising model as well. So we will further bring in others monetization opportunity for us and create strong revenue growth in the future.,Positive
Next please.,Positive
Thank you. Your next question comes from John Egbert from Stifel. Please go ahead.,Positive
Great thanks for taking my question. Advertising clearly has a ton of momentum. I think you each highlighted a few of the key drivers of recent strength there. But wondering if you could dig deeper into the runway for future advertising growth by maybe looking at the current state of your business there versus what you might think is possible in the next few years in terms of like ad coverage on your various services ad load within the screens that youre actively monetizing today potential for new ad formats to kind of change your capabilities anything worth calling out there,Positive
Yes sure. Advertising grew at a very rapid pace of over 100 yearoveryear for two consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter advertising now accounts for the majority of the nonsubscription revenue with an online music accounted for just over 50. And this is all in the result of the investments in the advertising technology and solutions that weve made in the last year. As well as leveraging Tencents groups overall strong ad sales capabilities which enable us to penetrate into an increasing number of advertisers. We also continue to see room for us to increase our ad load. There is more real estate on our various multiple platforms. That provides us with ample inventory and so far our ad format have been rather homogenous to the traditional banner I saw a splash screen. But as Cussion question mentioned in his earlier remarks we do intend to broaden our ad format into other ads such as audio ads reward ads as well as other. And as a result we expect such strong growth in advertising to continue for the near to midterm.,Positive
Okay question please.,Positive
Okay thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,Positive
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to the music subscription business. So I want to understand about the effectiveness of the paywall you mentioned about just over 20 by the end of last year and last year on average roughly we have added about 4 million per quarter. I want to understand about if we go from 20 to 30. The fifth organic conversion would increase from 4 million to something say 5 million would be faster than before. And actually on top of payroll you have better user engagement long form audio premium model promotions content a lot of new tools that you can drive conversion. So try to understand thats just the first part is the organic effectiveness of the payroll going from 20 to 30 compared with the 10 or 20. And then this new drivers how they can how much additional growth that can come from these new tools that can convert subscribers Thank you.,Positive
Yes sure. Music subscription. Revenues obviously continue to deliver pretty strong growth at around 42 yearoveryear. In particular the paying users record a strong growth at over 40 yearoveryear and the solid net additions of 4.3 million which brings the total pay users to 56 million or 9 paying ratio which is a substantial increase compared to just about 6 last year.,Positive
In addition to the paywall strategy that weve mentioned there are actually many other products and best investments as well as marketing campaigns that weve embarked on which are starting to pay benefits. We continue to observe the retention rate of our paying users continue to improve. Theyve basically been improving every quarter since the first quarter of 2019. So for eight quarters now which means that once weve converted a user from free to paying they are actually remaining as paying for a longer period of time compared to before. And thats also helping us to improve the pay user. And we are able to achieve all this throughout 2020 while seeing an increasing trend in ARPPU.,Positive
Right. So we are very optimistic. In terms of our subscription growth we expect like I said the net app in Q1 to be stronger than in Q4. And I guess for the year 2021. We expected average net ads to be approximately between 45 million per quarter. And which would be a strong growth driver to our overall business.,Positive
Next question please.,Negative
Thank you. Your next question comes from Alvin Neo from JPMorgan please go ahead.,Positive
Good morning management. Thank you for taking my question. I have a follow up question regarding your payroll strategy. Can you share with us how do you strike a balance between the size of the paying ratio and the platform users Theoretically you can achieve 100 of the paying ratio if you adopt a tap for Music type of monetization model i.e. content is only available to paying subscribers. But that will probably come at a big cost in terms of the platform usage or platform MAU. While your current strategy is pushing the size of the table gradually well driving up the paying ratio. Can you share with us philosophically how do you strike the balance and what are the key considerations to make you more aggressive or less aggressive increasing the size of the payroll and over longer term what could be the equilibrium level of the paying ratio Thank you,Positive
Thank you. Oh sure we there is a good balance that we do need to strike between pay well strategy as well as the free user experience. At this point in time we continue to see the payroll strategy to be very effective without substantially hurting the free user experience. However we are investing in new monetization capabilities such as various forms of advertising to help us monetize the free segments of users that for whatever reason may be very difficult to convert to premium.,Positive
And for that those particular user the monetization strategy isnt paywall the monetization strategy for those user would be advertising. And perhaps we would provide them with advertising as a way for them to unlock certain benefits which allow them to access a limited volume of songs behind the paywall. I think thats an example of how we can strike a good balance between free and pay users.,Positive
Again I think we continue to see the paywall strategy to be very effective. We expect the pace of that of that strategy will out to be in line with previous two years. And because of the various factors that we mentioned we expect the net ads of this year to continue to perform well of approximately 45 million per quarter this year which is an increase compared to last year.,Positive
And one more point I would like to add this as we mentioned before educating the user saying that the music to have a value greater times. That we are super excited because in the last two or three years we have done a great job and our users really treasure the music and also they are willing to pay for it. But nowadays when we are educating our users to buying a monthly subscription they will be happy to produce experience what I mean is they can enjoy all these songs. And they only need to worry about which kind of songs that they can listen on we found that  that they cannot. But at the same time we are also providing other privileges to them. So besides listening to song as we mentioned therell be also has a PME live events that we offered. So for our monthly subscribers they will have some privileges. For example in different special user experience is enjoying the TME Live event. So this is all the things that we keep evolving and keep innovating. And we are targeting to bring a new type of experience for the TME Live in this year. And also it will help our VIP which is a monthly subscriber to have more privileges.,Positive
Deciding this we are also focusing on the test based economy. So which means that if you are a monthly subscriber you will also enjoy some of the privileges on as well. So all of this will be worked together as a total package. And let our users really think that being a Monday subscribing VIP this is the right way to enjoy music and also all other people experience on our platform. We have been getting a really encouraging result by moving to the retention rate of our monthly subscription has already been keep continue improving. So I think this is a really good signal to us. And we strongly believe that with the combination of putting the songs behind the paywall in a steady pace together with the premium that I just mentioned it we really make our subscription model and together with advertising model as well. It we work out together and bring a good healthy development of our revenue in the future.,Positive
Great. Next question please.,Positive
Thank you. Your next question comes from Zhijing Liu from UBS. Please go ahead.,Positive
management for taking my question. I have two questions.,Negative
Sorry Zhijing we cant hear you. Do you mind speaking up a a little bit,Positive
Yes sorry. My first question is how do you think about the timing for us to promote a premium model of music apps Do we see any potential risk of balancing user experience and competition on premium models Second can you also show us some colors on how longform audio contributes to overall timespan of our music apps Thank you.,Positive
Sure in terms of the timing we continue to make investments in the various ad formats that leverage to monetize the fleet user base in particular the segments that may be difficult to convert to to premium. And thats ongoing. You see us talking about this in the last one to two quarters we will start to implement some of that as beta test during this year. But in terms of the exact timing of when we will scale up in a larger sense obviously we need to observe and how the adoption level and how the the effectiveness level of that.,Positive
And then in terms of longform audio I think its important to understand that theres a lot of natural synergies between music and audio. And just like in the radio era users are very used to listening to both music and audio content together. And similarly we actually see that dynamic playing out in online platforms. And so when we provide audio content to our music users they dont switch off and listen less to music in order to listen more to audio they actually end up increasing the total time spent.,Positive
And therefore its actually very it puts us in a very advantageous position in being the leading music platform going into audio and with the addressable market expected to reach to a similar size of music users the large several hundreds of millions in the next few years. Were very optimistic about the audio market as Cussion mentioned. And thats why we actually think together with our content strategy within audio that Cussion talked about our monetization strategy as well as our two pronged integrated music and audio app as well as standalone audio app strategy. I think all this would play very well to provide us with ample growth opportunity in the next few years.,Positive
Great were ready to take the next question please,Positive
Thank. Your next question comes from Vincent Yu from Needham and Company. Please go ahead.,Positive
Hello. Thank you management for taking my question. So the first question is also on longform audio. Just follow up on that question. Can management share some light on how these users paying habits are compared to the music only users. And I hear other NS ask about our target penetration rates for the near term for longform audio. So do we have some number that we can share And my second question is on the podcast. So does company have a plan to sign creators for exclusive content in the podcast space Thank you.,Positive
Yes in terms of target users for longform audio I think Cussion mentioned that weve reached about 10 million DAU. And you can see that our MAU reached about 90 million by the end of last year. And we expect our user base to double by 2020 and 2021. Right. So thats the near term target. And by no means were done we actually think the total addressable market as I just mentioned is very very large for audio market similar size to the music market in the high several 100 million in terms of scale and that will play out over the next few years. And we also see there to be ample monetization opportunity.,Positive
The end is different depending on the types of audio content. For example audio books which well talk about in the past being the biggest content category within the audio consumption. Thats obviously primarily driven a lot by subscription right chapter by chapter. And that plays very well in terms of synergies with our music subscription because we could bundle our music subscription plan with the audio subscription plan. And and on the other hand there are other forms of audio content which are much more suitable for audio advertising. And so were also seeing that play out and as our MAU and DAU grow we see ample opportunity in both of these two categories.,Positive
For the podcast content that you mentioned actually we are also closely in talks with different content providers I think theres different tiers of content that we try to bring into our platform. First of all which is similar to what the strategy that Spotify is doing theyre also talking to some of the top tier artists or maybe podcasters. We are also in talks to some of them. Some of them may be informed in industries and some of them is providing other content for more than  area. So the top here is we are in talks and we are also working on the long tail as well because our platform is really big. And I think that one of the competitive advantage that we have is we have given us a platform like the QQ Music Kugou and Kuwo and and all of the target audience will be a little bit different in terms of their positioning. So they can tailor make different kind of supportive professional content or the user generated content according to the needs of their own audience.,Positive
So I think that we are really open right now and having a lot of talks and especially heavily investing in the content side for not just longform audio but also podcasts as well.,Positive
Right. So were take our next question please,Positive
Thank. Your next question comes from Vinny Wong from CICC. Please go ahead.,Positive
Sorry this Binnie from HSBC. So I have two questions here very quick one. I just want to follow up with Shirley here in terms of the investment because I think in the previous two years we talk about that we are very interesting a lot ambiguous acquisition and also a new form of business. So I just want to understand that how much of this initiative should we expect to see more meaningful revenue contribution into 2021 Thats one question. And just one really quick follow up is in terms of live streaming. So we see some of your short video players have also been seeing that like live streaming growth has also been softening from last year for certain reasons right. But then if you look at into 2021 how do we provision in life streaming Because I think they also if you look at like ARPPU also paying ratio there is something like how can we maintain at a more competitive level in the live streaming business And how can you see in 2021 this will change given that this is a one of our most meaningful earning strides Thank you.,Positive
Sure in terms of live streaming I mean associate entertainment broadly revenue grew by 8 yearoveryear as a result of obviously more difficult based effect comparison comparing to the preCOVID Q4 last year but also impacted by the lingering weakness in the macro economic situation which affected the paying users willingness to spend. However on the other hand we are encouraged to see a continue recovery in our traditional Kugou and Kuwo life in inorganic sense. And in addition we also broadening the content category to include ACG China ancient style but also around music. And thats the key point because even though you may be benchmarking us against other peers but its important to stress that our live streaming is differentiated it is a meal most music centric compared to other peers. And that continues to provide us with differentiation in terms of attracting performance as well as users.,Positive
In addition to that we obviously have were very pleased to see the continued scale up in QQ Music live streaming which will continue to see an increasing contribution to social entertainment revenue into 21. As well as we also encourage to see that we things DAU and MAU decline clearly bought bottom in Q4 and beginning to see a sequential growth in December January compared to September October for example.,Positive
So as a result we as we look into the full year 2021. Well I mean in terms of total revenue growth we actually expect our total revenue growth to be growing at a faster pace at close to 20 compared to 2020 14. And thats a result of faster growth rate in both online music as well as social entertainment.,Positive
And also for the social entertainment side besides the live streaming I would like to spend a little bit of time talking about the leasing platform Indiscernible. Actually its a very unique platform that he and we have and especially make us stand out in the industry. Last year I think that we are doing actually is the evolution and trying to make it to be more up to the current needs of the users. So what we are doing is actually I think that singing is still a very strong demand from a user. So we are focusing on making the singing experience even better than before we lower the content productions entry barrier. And we create a lot of tools and helping our users to make their content better and lead them to share on the social platform.,Positive
So I think that what were doing is not just doing this engagement but we are doing user interaction this is very important. And besides we are also bringing in the short form recommendation feed on the  the leasing platform which really allowing us to increase the people to consume more audio and video based content. So I think this is some of the evolutions that we have made and really make the overall the user base is really bottom out. And we are seeing a positive trend in earnest. One is one one. So I think that for the user comp speciality for the social entertainment side besides all the saw the live streaming environment and also the revenue Outlook I think that  is also another platform that we will be strongly focusing on. And this is also the unique very special platform that we have when compared to our competitors.,Positive
Okay so in the interest of time well take our last question operator.,Positive
Thank you. Your next question comes from Thomas Chong from Jefferies. Please go ahead.,Positive
Good morning. Thanks management for taking my questions and congratulations on a solid set of results. Just wanted to talk about the 2021 revenue growth also asked about how we should think about the margin side or how we should think about the trend in terms of the expenses. Given that we also have our lumber hall areas for investment. On that one can you also comments about our MA strategies as well as the regulatory environments in China as we further expand our scale. Thank you.,Positive
Sure well first touch upon the regulation and MA and then let Shirley take the marketing question. In terms of regulation we continue to maintain a very constructive relationship and a close working dialogue and relationship with the relevant authorities. Even when the relevant authorities issued any new rules were permitted to work closely with them to comply with the applicable laws and regulations. Because our overall goal is to work towards promoting healthy growth and development of the China music industry. And TME has been in operation for 16 years over 16 years and we face multiple revenue regulations throughout our corporate life. And we are experienced in dealing with new regulation and we fully committed to comply with relevant authorities.,Positive
And then in terms of MA as you can see we recently announced the acquisition of Lazy Audio which is an integral part of our longform audio strategy which is very highly strategic and long term which were very committed to. You see us continuously set up increasing amount of joint venture to venture into content development with our partner legal partners. We set up we announced that we will set up a joint venture with universal and then just today were announcing that were setting up a joint venture with Warner. And thats following a very successful JV that weve already had with Sony and all these will lead us to continuously improving our content development and promotional capabilities which is also very synergistic to our music platform and music distribution business.,Positive
So well continue to explore MA opportunities around our core music and audio platforms. And well deploy capital in a in a in a disciplined manner.,Positive
Yes in terms of the MA I really think that is a really exciting journey for us because our feeling is not doing financial investment but instead we really want to have a very strong business cooperations with our partners. As Tony mentioned of the joint venture of music labels we really worked out. I remember that around three years ago where we talked about the first major label JV with Sony Music we just bring it out. And then Im so glad that we have the support of the three majors and its only really joint has with us. And nowadays if you guys are recognizing that we are just rolling out a number of really good songs in this two days especially we have a very close partnership with the Tencent games in rolling out the theme song for the Top Chief the first anniversary. And we actually roll out a project together with some really renowned worldwide artists like the DJ we have and also with Jody Ph Insight which is also another very popular female artists in Asia. So I think this is some of the  we started to bear the fruit. And so I think that this is something that really made us excited because we are not just doing some financial investment. But instead we are creating wonderful piece of content that was widely accepted and being praised by the industry and also especially by our users.,Positive
As we mentioned during the last call so the announcement we are also going to have analysts JV with a Universal Music set up is now in really good progress. The management is on board already. And we have a different positioning for this music label. And Im looking forward to have creating more quick songs for the industry in the future.,Positive
And today we announced that we announced another joint venture which is with Warner music I think we will pull up on that and really made us to to show that TME is really opened. And we would like to team up with of the industry player in order to make this going to be a winning situation and create better content for our users. So this is very exciting for us. So maybe Shirley maybe you can talk about the margin side,Positive
Okay about the gross margin. In Q4 2020 our gross margin is 32.4 that is relatively stable compared to that of Q3 and meet our expectations. In Q4 the rapid growth of subscriber revenue and advertising revenue have positively impacted our gross margins. And in Q4 we will ride to the next gen gala or we will provide more for promotion actives and those for the performers. So the revenue sharing of the ratio the revenue sharing of social entertainment is increased. And it includes the Q4 gross is stable. Looking forward to 2021 we expect the first growth of subscription revenue and advertising revenue will be a continual high will positively impact our gross margin. And second we will keep an eye on the industry we will control our revenue sharing fees or for social entertainment. So exceptions these two points we will invest more on our new products and new futures such as long form audio and passive ecosystem. In conclusion in 2020 we will we will invest more on new products and pave way for our long term growth.,Positive
And so just to close out I think were very pleased with this quarters results with online music subscription revenue continuing its rapid growth. And we believe Chinas online music industry continue to be in a long term secular growth trend that will provide us ample opportunities in the future. And outlook in 2021 remains very positive we expect total revenue growth to accelerate compared to 2020 close to 20 driven by faster growth rates in both online music and social entertainment services.,Positive
A  Millicent T.,Negative
Okay so thank you everyone for joining us today. And this concludes todays call and we look forward to speaking to you again. Thank you and goodbye.,Positive
Thank you so much.,Positive
Thank you.,Positive
