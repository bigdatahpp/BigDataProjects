Our enterprise momentum drove yearoveryear growth of 34 in customer spending more than 500000 and 44 in customers spending more than 1 million.

Our remaining performance obligations which grew 59 from the same period a year ago reflect momentum in multiyear deals particularly from the enterprise.

At above 95 we continue to have industryleading renewal rates.,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Before turning to operating expenses I would like to highlight the robust growth in our international markets. Revenue grew 34 yearoveryear to total 24 of our revenue.

I will now turn to the detailed nonGAAP financial results. As a reminder a reconciliation between GAAP and nonGAAP results is available in our earnings release. For the full year operating expenses were 204 million compared to 171 million from a year ago as we continue to invest in the business. For the quarter operating expenses were 56 million compared to 44 million in the prior period. This is a 28 increase primarily due to investments in our gotomarket strategy offset by COVIDrelated savings due to reduced travel and officerelated costs.,PD,0.9315814971923828,0.8631629128235059,Positive
Research and development expenses were 14 million compared to 12 million in the same period a year ago a 14 increase.

Sales and marketing expenses were 13 million or 51 of revenue for the quarter compared to 48 of revenue in the prior year.

While we managed our investments closely in light of the pandemic we also benefited from savings in fiscal 2021 as a result of moving from inperson events to virtual events not traveling and not incurring all costs associated with our offices. In fiscal 2022 we expect some increase in these types of expenses albeit not at preCOVID levels. In addition we will continue to invest in Rundeck integration and innovation and fiscal 2022 will reflect a full year of owning this business.,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with 560 million in cash cash equivalents and investments.

Free cash flow increased by over 100 to 2 million in the fourth quarter driven by positive operating cash flow and the deferral of investments in new and existing offices.

This was a major milestone for us generating positive operating cash flow while continuing to invest in innovation.,PD,0.9736361503601074,0.9472722692920383,Positive
That said we expect to dip in and out of positive operating cash flow during FY 22 and do not expect to be positive in the first quarter due to timing of certain cash payments. There are a number of cash payments that will occur this fiscal year that are either new or incremental namely a 4 million payment related to the acquisition of Rundeck and a full year of interest payments of 4 million associated with our convertible debt issued in June 2021.,PD,0.8796396851539612,0.7592792268271606,Positive

NonGAAP net loss per share in the range of 0.09 to 0.10 with basic shares outstanding of approximately 83 million. This implies a nonGAAP operating loss margin in the range of 10 to 12.

Thank you. Operator Instructions Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets has had his hand raised early on. Matt go ahead.,PD,0.9417595863342284,0.8835191032404321,Positive
Hey. Thank you guys and congrats on a great close to the year. The acceleration really across the board was really good to see. Jen theres a lot of things to unpack here but success outside of ITOps weve been talking about this for a long time.,PD,0.999980330467224,0.9999606609110001,Positive
You noted some of the adoption of customer service and security which is great to hear. Im wondering is the success youre seeing there is that largely expansion in your base or crosssell or in fact are you starting to land in some of these new use cases as an initial entrance into the PagerDuty family,PD,0.9992438554763794,0.9984877100513638,Positive
Thanks for the question Matt and thanks for being here. Its generally expansion within our base although with the acquisition of Rundeck we do see that as an opportunity to land customers through the automation use case as well.,PD,0.9992844462394714,0.9985688916259359,Positive
Thats great. And then Howard you mentioned that youre optimistic on fiscal 2022. You seem to have a lot of momentum coming out of 2021. Im curious how do you think about your pipeline here I mean it feels like theres building momentum. Youre effectively halfway through Q1. Can you just talk about sort of the  your sense of pipeline generation Are things accelerating there as well that really supports sort of the guide,PD,0.9999977350234984,0.9999954700442968,Positive
Yes. So Matt I think what weve seen particularly in the back half of this last year sales execution has improved significantly under the leadership of Dave Justice. And that includes far more proactive efforts around pipeline generation. Weve also seen how we were able to clearly seamlessly move away to new methods of generating pipeline as we move to more virtual events. So we feel very confident in the health of our pipeline and the mechanisms that we have in place to continue to manage that proactively.,PD,0.99907249212265,0.9981449831396239,Positive
Yes. And if I could add to that Matt I would say that Im confident we can get our growth into the 30s. I think we have the right strategy. We have the best product. And we have a very experienced team. So I like what were seeing in terms of trajectory. Were also seeing some early positive signs that the impact of the pandemic is receding. So were reasonably optimistic particularly given our historical strength in small business and verticals like travel hospitality and entertainment we see those segments reopening as tailwinds for the business.,PD,1.0,1.0,Positive
Yes I would also say that were seeing a lot of customers who have had to really shift their business like a large coffee retailer you might know of where mobile pickup and pay has become really important. Thats a pandemicdriven shift but its here to stay. And that kind of dependence on digital assets becomes another tailwind for us. So we like the velocity that we have going into the year and feeling good about our gotomarket leadership and with Sean coming on Board excited about product innovation as well.,PD,0.999975323677063,0.9999506473247095,Positive
Thanks a lot. Congrats guys.,PD,0.995254635810852,0.9905092659647858,Positive
Thank you.,PD,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you Matt. And next wed move to William Blair lets see trying to locate that video. Bear with me just a sec. There we are. Bhavan Suri please go ahead.,PD,0.9980043172836304,0.9960086321882202,Positive
Thanks. Ill echo my congrats too. I guess I wanted to touch a little bit on following up on the previous question about pipeline. You obviously had  and I know Howard you said dont look at billings but you had a phenomenal billings quarter so we wont look at it. But was there some quarter that happened Did you see sort of a set of larger deals was  I know you mentioned the commercial business but just a little more color on what drove fairly material upside in that And then Ive got a question on DRR.,PD,0.9999969601631165,0.9999939203226091,Positive
Sure. So as I mentioned in my comments it certainly was a good quarter for billings. So I wasnt going to complain about 21 billings growth yearoveryear. But we do note that we did do a number of large multiyear deals within the quarter and we also had a few renewals that because of expansion activity were brought forward. That being said across the board all of our teams executed well. And so we saw a highvolume of transactions even a lot of smaller transactions and all of that contributed to a healthy billings number.,PD,0.999935269355774,0.9998705386343831,Positive
Got you. Got you. And then if we take the sort of reacceleration in the dollar retention and we think about pricing impacts and we think about concessions youve given and the loyalty youve talked about Jennifer and Howard about customers indiscernible come back are we starting to see that play out Was this because of the large deals that we saw in that dollar retention and the expansions come in Help us balance those two out Is it  are we getting passive Youve seen some early green shoots but was this because of billings and expansions that drove the net dollar retention rate improvement or a combination or if you could piece that out for us that would be really helpful I think.,PD,0.9966363310813904,0.9932726581529725,Positive
Sure. So  and Jen may have some comments on this too. I think the way that I would characterize it is our strength in enterprise is wellestablished. And we continue to see large customers within the enterprise expand with us. And so its now become quite predictable that well have about onethird of our customers enterprise customers expand with us each quarter. We saw some spend contracting in the early days of the pandemic. But certainly today were seeing that more of that preCOVID like demand is back right And so those customers are expanding with us. And thats contributing to the good netnet dollar retention rate. However across all of our segments were seeing positive movement. Its not exclusively in the enterprise. Enterprise is above 125 but were seeing healthy expansion happening in all of our segments today.,PD,0.9999955892562866,0.9999911785073152,Positive
Yeah. Id add to that that the success that were having with the digital operations platform is really driving user expansion within large customers within our base. And I think our customers have learned that that Clydesdale rule applies that with PagerDutys ROI as you add more users that ROI scales exponentially. Likewise users recognize that the more users on the platform the easier their job is.,PD,0.9980890154838562,0.99617802868964,Positive
So were starting to see that network effect at scale. And that makes a meaningful difference. I also  I just want to recognize our teams again because you look at midmarket setting a pretty significant record on the number of transactions their transaction growth over the quarter. I love it when I see that because thats the nature of our hybrid gotomarket model at work where youre doing high velocity transactions and at the same time still able to do large expansions in enterprise and Dave and his leadership team have done a great job there.,PD,0.999275803565979,0.9985516062686481,Positive
No no thank you. Absolutely. And congratulations to Dave and all of your teams. Really nice job. Thanks.,PD,0.999894917011261,0.9997898338972533,Positive
Thank you.,PD,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thanks Bhavan.,PD,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thank you. Next well go to a hand raise from  Rishi Jaluria excuse me DA Davidson. Let me go ahead and add you to the spotlight.,PD,0.9994840025901794,0.9989680045652416,Positive
Hey Rishi.,PD,0.8045236468315125,0.609047060636914,Positive
Hey Jennifer and Howard thank you so much for taking my questions. Great to see the reacceleration in the business. Jennifer I want to go to a comment you made in response to Matts question at the very beginning which is that youre confident that you can get your growth into the 30s not going to hold you to that as guidance. I think thats a great aspirational goal.,PD,0.9999988675117492,0.9999977350221483,Positive
Thank you.,PD,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
But maybe if you could help us understand what is it that youre seeing thats giving you confidence in that as a reasonable target And maybe how should we be thinking about the drivers to achieve there is that just a bounce back and macro is that relying on more growth in these noncore use cases where youre talking about security and customer support and then maybe some that were not even talking about today that we might be talking about a year from now Maybe lets drill into that. And then I have a followup for Howard.,PD,0.9999993443489076,0.9999986886970336,Positive
Its definitely a combination of things. I think strengthen  when we went public actually we talked about multiple engines for growth. And I think we really delivered on that mindset our new product if you look at digital  ARR from digital operations management like thats doubled from that plan our regional growth is up 40. So were starting to see the new our new investments in EMEA and APJ come online user growths up 40.,PD,0.9950829744338988,0.9901659430062428,Positive
And then were really starting to see traction in some of the most I think sensible adjacent use cases like security and customer service but were also seeing user expansion drive new used cases that we dont even track. So those growth engines are working the way we intended them to. Were executing better from a gotomarket perspective. And I do think the macro is improving and its improving in a way thats favorable to us because remember we dont have a bunch of pullforward revenue from COVID rather what were seeing is as customers get into either recovery mode as they have gotten about managing remote work and they have made that transition to digital they are making more strategic investments. Our sales teams have given us feedback that they are just seeing many more transformative deals as opposed to tactical deals.,PD,0.9944424629211426,0.9888849192171807,Positive
Secondly as some of the rest of the market recovers we expect to see them start to invest like they did potentially preCOVID or even more than they were investing during COVID because they are now more reliant on the digital environment.,PD,0.9668920040130616,0.9337839685582929,Positive
And so I think reopening  and even hybrid work is a bit of a tailwind for us because when  right now when everybody is working at home it works really well. You know where everybody is. As soon as half the company is in offices and half the companys remote somewhere you cant find them that those teams feel even more distributed and PageDuty was built for that.,PD,0.0011677145957946,-0.9976657615099918,Negative
So I think were going to continue to pull away from the competition like we have been the last couple of years and that also bodes well for us. But I just  I like how its all coming together. Its probably a really good way to put it.,PD,0.989268958568573,0.9785379043447402,Positive
Fantastic. Thats great to hear. And then Howard I wanted to drill a little bit more into the margin guidance for next year. You are talking about margins declining pretty meaningfully. Maybe you can you tell us  where are you seeing these  what do you  what are the high priorities for the incremental investments And maybe you did touch on this in the prepared remarks but you obviously expect some bounce back of COVIDrelated savings as travel becomes a little bit more reasonable than expectation. Can you maybe talk about how much of those costs are coming back and what your assumptions baked into that margin guidance are And maybe alongside that just overall have you turned the corner on at least being sustainably free cash flow positive on a full year basis Thanks.,PD,0.999959111213684,0.9999182223786247,Positive
Sure. So I would probably unpack it this way Rishi. When we look at our operating margin you have identified some of the elements correctly. There was a certain amount of savings that we got this past year related to COVID. But then there were also some proactive measures we put in place as last year in light of the macroeconomic uncertainty where we slowed down certain parts of our activity intentionally like things like hiring because whilst we wanted to get a better understanding of what was happening in the environment.,PD,0.9988017082214355,0.9976034150143951,Positive
So now that we are seeing our execution operating so well our view is that we can take a far more progressive view on investment into this next year. So what that means is one well have Rundeck which will be with us for the full year and we have significant investment in Rundeck through this next year. So that has an impact which we spoke about at the time of the acquisition.,PD,0.9998818635940552,0.9997637270472808,Positive
The second is that were planning to accelerate our investment in engineering because we believe that from an innovation perspective weve delivered a huge amount of value to our customer base within this last year but its not yet done. We have a number of initiatives such as the European data hosting which is another initiative that is kind of additive to what were doing.,PD,0.9942007064819336,0.9884014060505664,Positive
So when you add all of those together our view is that this is the right time for us to continue to invest in the business to continue to invest in gotomarket because the demand is clearly there. And thats why we framed our thinking around operating margin in that 10 to 12 range  or operating loss 10 to 12.,PD,0.9263650178909302,0.8527299480020689,Positive
I would just add to that. When you look at the solid performance on unit economics for the business and also you look at how early we are in this transition the total addressable market that gives us confidence to continue to invest in growth particularly around product innovation because thats where were demonstrating a number of competitive moats that I think we can build upon.,PD,0.9989767670631408,0.9979535329064921,Positive
We were  the prior year we were at negative 17 operating margin. We improved to negative 9 this year. Weve demonstrated our ability to be able to make that progress. So we will continue to be prudent in how we manage those things. And pure comment on operating cash flow clearly its always been a goal for us to be sustainably cash flow positive.,PD,0.9923208951950072,0.9846417812358026,Positive
We have a few things that are happening this year like the payments related to the Rundeck acquisition and the full interest payments from the capital raise we did last year that are going to mean that some quarters we wont be but we will continue to be working to be sustainably cash flow positive.,PD,0.0707301199436187,-0.8585408678894448,Negative
Wonderful very helpful. Thank you Jennifer Howard.,PD,0.9966473579406738,0.9932947118846844,Positive
Thank you.,PD,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you so much. Next question came in as a chat request. Derrick Wood Id like to turn to you. Derrick let me bring it to spot light please. Hi Derrick its from Cowen  Company. Go ahead Derrick. Thank you.,PD,0.999996304512024,0.9999926090196427,Positive
Hi Derrick.,PD,0.7536945343017578,0.5073887749843449,Positive
Hi Derrick.,PD,0.7536945343017578,0.5073887749843449,Positive
Long time listener first time caller. So thanks for taking my questions. First you guys rolled out some new pricing and packaging recently and I wanted to ask about 2 things. First on the free tier wed love to hear how thats helping build a new customer funnel and whether you see trade downs or thats really just about new funnel generation,PD,0.9977526664733888,0.9955053302677457,Positive
And then second on the simplification of the SKUs and just would love to hear the dividends from that and how you expect that to impact the model specifically net revenue retention rates heading into the New Year,PD,0.8618050813674927,0.7236099979937065,Positive
Well Ill kick off by talking a little bit about free and then Howard can jump in and talk about pricing. On free thats been a really important new offer for us to try and stimulate trial and more activity in the top of the funnel and thats going well. When you look at our new accounts both free and paid thats up 23 yearoveryear. So we like the momentum that were seeing there.,PD,0.9974496364593506,0.9948992698784291,Positive
Free has also given us an opportunity to invest in longterm relationships with our small businesses who really struggled this year to find OpEx to invest in things. So its helped us I think to continue to keep some of those customer relationships engaged. And frankly it reduces friction for trial. So its bringing more users on to the platform which we have I think a good track record in converting.,PD,0.9906012415885924,0.981202471972985,Positive
So its still very early days as an experiment for us. But again kind of we like what were seeing there. And were seeing it helpful across all of our segments not just small business and very small business. And I think with Sean Scott here you should expect to see us try and build more functionality more discovery more capability in the early use of our product the trial experience how our customers discover us how they discover new products et cetera. Howard do you want to talk about pricing,PD,0.9994782209396362,0.9989564412572629,Positive
Yes. And I would add to that I think the simplification that we did on our pricing structure and our plans has yielded benefits almost immediately because its made it easier for customers to buy. So the selection process of which plan they should take theyre no longer confounded by is this plan with this option. The simplicity in that has made it easier for them to progress through the tiers. And I think thats part of why weve seen people make the choice around our digital operations plan because its very clear the value theyre going to get into it and weve made it easy for them to buy.,PD,0.9351744055747986,0.8703487338714206,Positive
Great thanks for the color. If I could squeeze one more in So you guys have a new product geared for customer service specifically. Can you just explain how thats different from the core And maybe how youll kind of be more strategic around trying to sell that in the New Year Will there be a dedicated sales force or how do you plan to take that to market,PD,0.9999803900718688,0.9999607801203607,Positive
Sure. Ill take that. We actually have one of our executives leading a dedicated business unit around customer service so really starting to focus on that. And if you think about it the platforms and products that customer service agents work in are very different from the products and services that developers and IT organizations use.,PD,0.9953198432922364,0.990639681005288,Positive
So our customer service offering really started with deep integrations into products like Salesforce Service Cloud and Zendesk. And we just saw a lot of uptake in when we built those integrations and we sort of started there and then started to add feature sets.,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And if you think about it case management. So customer  inbound customer case management is very similar to incident management. But as businesses have become more digital the urgency the sort of realtime operations challenge has become a lot harder for a customer  for our customers because they have less time before a customer will start shouting on Twitter or Reddit or getting angry or wherever theyre going to get angry. They dont call and wait on the 1800 line for you to patiently express whats going on.,PD,0.0067783594131469,-0.9864444651868733,Negative
And so the challenge for these service agents is they need to get to the developers in the organization the IT team the security team et cetera. And historically those teams are all on different platforms. What PagerDuty does really well is orchestrate that effort across teams across platforms without the agent needing to leave the context of the environment that theyre in. So huge time savings huge productivity savings and theyre able to get the attention of dev and IT very quickly to solve some of these problems.,PD,0.9217768907546996,0.8435536882601309,Positive
Likewise theyre able to talk to agents intelligently about whats actually going on how long it will take to resolve something et cetera so able to give better information to service agents as well. So thats  these are sort of early days. There are some additional use cases that were working on or serving but thats kind of the starting point.,PD,0.9215655326843262,0.8431309718674254,Positive
Great. Thank you. Congrats on a strong Q4.,PD,0.9998266696929932,0.9996533391793603,Positive
Thank you. Nice to have you.,PD,0.99679696559906,0.9935939273798031,Positive
Thanks Derrick,PD,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thank you. Next well be hearing from Sterling  lets see where Sterling went Hes unmated. There we go. Thank you. Sorry about that. Sterling here we are with JPMorgan. Go ahead.,PD,0.9998403787612916,0.9996807573322997,Positive
I was just going to hide my video I was hiding from  so guys I think youve given some of the breadcrumbs to answer part of this but I want to make sure I fully understand. When you look at the success that you had in the enterprise segment in particular and in the quarter how much of that was coming from expansion in existing customers which we saw in the net dollar retention versus how much of that is actually bringing on new enterprise customers in the quarter that might be a result of some of the improved sales execution,PD,0.994841694831848,0.9896833835145133,Positive
Owen Wilson,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So Sterling it is a combination of both. We definitely saw good expansion in the enterprise. The enterprise segment now covers more than 50 of our revenues. And so we certainly saw good expansion which shows up in the dollarbased net retention rate. But weve also been pleased with the customer acquisition that were seeing in the enterprise and the midmarket segment.,PD,0.996566653251648,0.9931333024104252,Positive
So weve been bringing on  and much in our land and expand model that weve spoken about for a few years weve been bringing on enterprises and theyre starting with us small in teams and then growing into those cohorts of the 100000 and 500000 and 1 million.,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then just maybe as a followup Jennifer as you think about that why not What is it that these enterprises  is it just theyre giving up on inhouse solutions that maybe they were trying to use Is it that its clear that you separated from the competition What are the major  and Im sure theres a number of them but what would you say are the one or two things that are causing enterprises to choose you now,PD,0.9905349612236024,0.9810699111639927,Positive
Its definitely a couple of things. Its definitely the digitization of these business models creating a sense of urgency to figure out how to make all the complex technology that sits underneath their brand engagement their end consumer engagement their employee engagement right And I think COVID taught many leaders not just technical leaders but CEOs that when  that digital is care to stay and its driving the majority of your business now not the minority part of your business. And so youve got to get that right.,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The second thing is I think weve just made it clear that we are the only and the best solution for realtime ops for digital ops and enterprise. Theres just nobody whos come close to proving their resiliency and their scale at our level in a way that developers will not only adopt but drive virally across the organization.,PD,0.9925873279571532,0.9851746470777074,Positive
And then theres one other trend that I dont think we talk about enough which is leadership in these large enterprises are increasingly more technical. So youre seeing large traditional companies hire cloud executives from Amazon right and Google et cetera. So youre finding CTOs and CIOs that are developers like were coders we have carried the pager like really understand the value of not just our first use case but automating and preventing incidents by using data and machine learning.,PD,0.1898633241653442,-0.6202743174280629,Negative
So its just more of an open mind towards adopting some of our newer solutions. And thats probably the thing that Ive been the most excited about. When you look at the customers spending over 1 million growing by 44 thats because theyre not like crawling walking and running. Theyre putting together a transformative relationship with us from the start. And then the growth comes as they add users and teams and bring them on board.,PD,0.9942950010299684,0.988589995259044,Positive
Got it. Thank you.,PD,0.9929356575012208,0.985871306581084,Positive
Okay. Thank you so much. Going back to some hands raised from Morgan Stanley we have Sanjit Singh. Sanjit on to the spotlight here.,PD,0.9970393180847168,0.9940786326400237,Positive
Well thank you. Congrats on Q4. And really thank you for all the great metrics this quarter. A lot of things stand out. I think Event Intelligence being up 160 was a particular standout. And I guess my question for you Jen is going back to the IPO youre really clear with us on what the marching orders for the company was which was to move upmarket and frankly be able to monetize your technology lead relative to customers. And I guess its been the theme of this call so far but along the dimensions of sales cycles deal sizes how often customers sort of haggle with you on price where are you today versus 12 months ago 18 months ago when were sort of really starting that journey,PD,0.9997913241386414,0.9995826480285215,Positive
Im really proud of the balance that weve struck there. We always talked about our hybrid gotomarket model the fact that we  our land motion is ecommercedriven and then our expand motion starts out as transactional and very short sales cycles a lot of deals created and closed in the quarter. But then as weve gotten into more strategic relationships where youve got thousands or tens of thousands of users inside a Fortune 100 company they want a partner to support them.,PD,0.9974883794784546,0.9949767559628224,Positive
They want strategic customer success. They want professional services. They want an experienced account executive to help them. And I think Dave and the team have done a great job of bringing that to lay for us without damaging the velocity of the flywheel at the same token. So like we wont dive in deep into the funnel to get hands on something that can grow on its own. So thats one thing Im really proud of.,PD,0.0156100988388061,-0.9687809758072948,Negative
The second thing is I think the product team has really struck the balance between getting new features to market but also continuing to add robust services and important reliability and resiliency investments to the platform so that we can support the largest customers in the world the most innovative customers in the world in doing what they need to do at the pace they need to do it right And so one of the challenges that you have as you grow in enterprise size and Ive seen this in my career is you get a lot of customer requests. And theyre not always request youre going to want to build for the rest of the market so youve really got to strike that balance. And the product team has worked really hard to be in the market listening to our largest customers but also making sure that when we build something its going to engage our entire user community not a couple of large customers that have a corner case. So I think thats been good.,PD,0.9999834895133972,0.9999669790071124,Positive
I also think that there is a recognition around our ROI and our payback and our time to value. So its not a threeyear problem to figure out whether the investment you made in PagerDuty is going to pay off. Its a twomonth payback. Its an 800 ROI over three years. And that  like we get those numbers from our customers. IDC audited those numbers. So when you see that it becomes a much easier conversation as the quantifiable value prop becomes more obvious. And weve gotten better at having that conversation with customers as weve grown up for sure.,PD,0.9964697360992432,0.9929394679900814,Positive
And then the last thing that I would say is were still being chosen by the most innovative startups on the planet. So if you look at where the developer community looks for influence were still the first choice there. The market has been very concerned over competition for a very long time and every quarter we prove that that is not an issue for us and were going to continue to prove that until it doesnt come up anymore.,PD,0.8673677444458008,0.7347353307815379,Positive
Its coming up less and less so thats definitely a good sign. As a followup question I wanted to ask about whats going on in security because it seems like that market is evolving kind of like cloud and the DevOps movement gave rise to observability and automated incident response. It seems like cloud security is on a similar track and weve seen a lot of MA security guys requiring log analytics vendors to do that convergence for the SOP team. And so Im wondering to think about how you were thinking about the security operations team and what your roadmap and your ability to serve those sets of users as they lean into the cloud at a much more accelerated pace coming out of the crisis,PD,0.8303593397140503,0.6607184772005541,Positive
We already serve SecOps teams very well. We dont market ourselves very well in that regard. But we already serve SecOps teams very well because if you think about it responding to a security breach or a potential threat is the best version of incident response. Its the best example of why its missioncritical why its timesensitive how unpredictable it is and how often unstructured it is and the only way you resolve a situation like a breach to data leak a potential threat et cetera is to orchestrate very detailed troubleshooting and work across multiple teams across the organization and PagerDuty already does that.,PD,0.063391774892807,-0.8732175667390625,Negative
The other thing that were seeing is developers largely comprise SecOp teams so they already have a PagerDuty experience thats been positive. Its often a developer who moves into security that brings us in et cetera.,PD,0.0937100946903228,-0.8125808910017558,Negative
And if you  and then the last thing that I would say is when you look at Event Intelligence and what weve done with digital operations management it is about really finding signal in the noise. As these events are coming through those integration investments that weve made to the security stack the threat management stack et cetera have been really important in diligencing is this a technology issue is it a security issue is it a data issue et cetera. So  and I guess one final thing I would say is the security team and the dev team need to work really effectively together. And ITSM products do not serve the urgent nature of something that is happening right now that could be business critical where youve got to engage with developers in seconds and minutes not raise a ticket and wait for a developer to open up their email and find that.,PD,0.0001116394996643,-0.9997779129611927,Negative
So the timeliness of getting that work done is really important. So that is an area that we will continue to invest in. And I think we have to think about is that the right business model to do that longterm et cetera but Im also always trying to help to make sure were not focusing on too many things at once. And so were really following where the customer is headed. And we do see the developer community having a huge influence in the SecOps team and in the SOP.,PD,0.9999071955680848,0.9998143910255382,Positive

Good.,PD,0.969902276992798,0.9398045181062928,Positive
Great. Thank you. How are you,PD,0.9994006156921388,0.9988012306697553,Positive
Good. So Howard do you have the CRPO number handy for the quarter,PD,0.961193323135376,0.9223866000095606,Positive
Yes. So our remaining performance operation number I knew the percentage I will give it to you in just a minute 121 million.,PD,0.7836153507232666,0.5672304434957764,Positive
Okay. And that was CRPO,PD,0.7889983654022217,0.5779964792707439,Positive
That was  yes.,PD,0.8736962080001831,0.7473922654344234,Positive
And that was up how much,PD,0.0769741833209991,-0.8460527336911761,Negative
Up 59.,PD,0.7399190664291382,0.47983782281745846,Positive
Okay. So CRPO was up the same amount as overall RPO,PD,0.2022065818309784,-0.595587787382476,Negative
Sorry CRPO no I dont have those numbers with me.,PD,0.016388714313507,-0.9672237439297106,Negative
Yes. Okay. And then  so just kind of pushing a little bit pushing you to a little bit on the guide. And I think Jennifer maybe let the cat out of the bag on 30 growth your expectations which Id love to hear and everybody wants more. Just for the growth in Event Intelligence the growth in the digital ops platform and the acceleration youre seeing in enterprise and the comeback in SMB the net expansion range you gave Howard of 118 to 121 I guess anything can happen in any quarter on that metric. But why would that metric go backwards from where we are today Is there something under the hood that youre looking at,PD,0.9974266290664672,0.9948532550652354,Positive
Yes. So just the mechanics the range that we provided is 118 to 124 weve seen some steady acceleration over the last two quarters in terms of that number. Part of the reason for why we expect it to fluctuate a bit is our expansions are often related to customers renewals right So thats often a time so theres a seasonality element to it that can change when these things  these occur. Sometimes we bring the renewal forward and so theres an early renewal.,PD,0.9988688230514526,0.9977376447544364,Positive
The other aspect of this is its very hard to always be sure exactly which customers in a cohort are going to expand. So whilst weve seen a high level of predictability particularly in the enterprise in terms of seeing roughly a third of our customers expand every quarter its hard to know exactly from which cohort how many will expand. But were feeling comfortable with our ability to forecast it and thats why weve decided this year to give focus a view on where we think we would land between the 1.18 and 1.24 expecting that whenever we land on average enterprise would be high.,PD,0.9479448199272156,0.8958895777997837,Positive
Right. And enterprise is now north of 50 of the business right,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Correct.,PD,0.969902276992798,0.9398045181062928,Positive
Yes. Okay. So if anything that number should accelerate right Not putting words in your mouth right,PD,0.9673321843147278,0.9346643296863613,Positive
We would expect that obviously enterprise being a large contributor to that number as enterprise continues to grow and we see that momentum continue it would contribute positively to the dollarbased net retention.,PD,0.9893555045127868,0.9787109963363385,Positive
Yes and Ill jump in there. Just to add a comment. I mean I am reasonably optimistic about the macro right now. I use the words right now very intentionally. I mean who knows whats going to happen in fall And so I just want to point out that like were still in a very volatile unpredictable macro environment. And were obviously thinking about that. My comments around getting back into the 30s like thats not a guide. That is  I am confident this company will get back with a free handle in front of it but Im not telling you when.,PD,0.9936000108718872,0.9872000141143884,Positive
Yes. And I mean I would just say Chad last year at this time we were having a very different call like the world is falling apart. And I was trying to give guidance at that point in time we decided not to suspend guidance despite the uncertainty and were weve actually make sure that weve exceeded our guidance every quarter. So my view is that I want to make sure that what I have visibility of today and we have reasonable visibility that leads us to give the guide that we do.,PD,0.1311041116714477,-0.7377928124623374,Negative
Howard also makes a really good point that if you think about PagerDuty on the whole and you think about our team and kind of how we think about our own business we are durable. Its a very durable business. Its been a pretty predictable business. Our customer expansion 13 of our enterprise customers expanding every quarter have been predictable. And thats because our customers have become reliant on us and they are consistently growing through their user base and through addons. And I expect that to continue. So that is one of those things that gives me a lot of confidence.,PD,0.9999921917915344,0.9999843835737607,Positive
Fair point from both of you on the guide last year. You were one of the few I will point out. Just one followup real quick I assume the expectations on new logo contribution for the year in terms of mix have not changed or any kind of different expectations on new logo contribution,PD,0.999968945980072,0.9999378919231248,Positive
So the way I would frame this is that the real revenue or ARR drivers for us are midmarket and enterprise logos. And those remain for us an area of focus. Obviously we are keen to add logos in the SMB space and very small business because thats where a lot of these companies start out. But what actually contributes to our results significantly its the upmarket numbers. And our expectations is that. we will continue to see those grow at a healthy rate.,PD,0.9953588247299194,0.9907176439271235,Positive
Great. Thank you. Great execution on the quarter and the year.,PD,0.9990453124046326,0.9980906236711882,Positive
Thanks Chad.,PD,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Okay thank you. And we do have a hand raise from Kingsley Crane at Berenberg. Operator Instructions,PD,0.998997688293457,0.9979953753920647,Positive
Q  Kingsley Crane,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi good to see you and thanks for fitting me in. I had a quick one on the user counts the 700000 users. Up 40 is remarkable higher than 32 growth last year and growing a little bit faster than revenue. So as we think about heading towards the 1 million user count should we expect user count to continue to outpace revenue How should we think about the drivers between customer service And youre also seeing a higher percentage of ARR due to digital ops as well so,PD,0.9999924898147584,0.999984979620564,Positive
Owen Wilson,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Should I take it Jen or do you want to,PD,0.89043790102005,0.7808756714318223,Positive
Ill take a crack at it and then you can correct me. So the number one I think what were seeing is the expansion of new teams across the organizations that we serve particularly driven by digital operations management plan. I think thats really helping us.,PD,0.0269391238689422,-0.9461229122417644,Negative
The second thing is we launched stakeholders and business response last year and so were seeing an uptick in stakeholder adoption. And those stakeholder licenses have a lower pricing than a traditional license so that will drive additional users on the platform.,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The last thing would be our free product which is going to continue to drive additional users onto the platform which gives us a lot more trial at the top of the funnel. So those are some of the things that I think are going to drive that user growth up in ways that I think are very positive for the company long term.,PD,0.9448975324630736,0.8897949992388481,Positive
Owen Wilson,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. And the 700000 users are all paid users that were referring to there. So this is representative of us becoming more ubiquitous within the organization as weve been used more broadly across an organization different use cases.,PD,0.2506076097488403,-0.4987856738481963,Negative
So for example if youre in a pure customer service type use case youre not going to  the kind of plan that you would need would be a different plan. Hence we created a different SKU for it to someone whos in dev. So that accounts for some of the variation there. But I would certainly expect that it will outpace the revenue growth.,PD,0.9995332956314088,0.9990665907064624,Positive
Okay. Thats helpful. And then last one. Already on version three of the Zendesk integration which was recently released that shows the pace of software development today. So I mean what have you learned recently with this integration And how is it  how youre feeding that back into the product,PD,0.9999679327011108,0.9999358653639945,Positive
I mean one thing weve learned is really hard being a customer service agent. Like if you think about like whose jobs have gotten more difficult by being remote and by being at a home a lot of troubleshooting happens when youre sitting together in the same area and your team manager is there and your unit managers there et cetera.,PD,0.931709885597229,0.8634196897862492,Positive
Customer service I think have been impacted by layoffs. Customers are using the public interweb to drive their feedback into an organization as opposed to chat and phone calls like they have in the past and email. So I think its tough to be a customer service agent.,PD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And one of the things that weve learned is anything we can do to make the contact switching to make the information consumption more actionable to orchestrate a response more quickly has a huge impact not just on productivity but on the health of that customer service team and ultimately the end consumer experience.,PD,0.9672603607177734,0.9345206824068322,Positive
And so usability which is one of the things that were known for is really important in that use case. Connecting people within the platform theyre in Salesforce Service Cloud Zendesk etcetera and being able to give them everything they need to know about an incident everything they need to know about whos on it how long its taking et cetera without them having to pivot into other platforms super important. And thats where our integration investments I think have really made a big difference. But I think were very very early here.,PD,0.9969200491905212,0.9938400947094528,Positive
Great. Yes. Well thats very helpful to hear. Right. And congrats again on a great quarter.,PD,0.999937117099762,0.9998742341245617,Positive
Thank you.,PD,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Well that concludes the questions that we have folks. Jennifer I would like to turn it back over to you to send us off with some closing remarks.,PD,0.959226131439209,0.9184522142721501,Positive
Well first I just want to thank everybody whos joined the call and thank our analyst community. You all have given us a lot of feedback.

Thank you Patrick. And good morning ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us today to discuss Wheatons fourth quarter and yearend results of 2020. I do hope everyone has been keeping healthy and safe since our last quarterly conference call. As we near the oneyear mark of the COVID19 pandemic our top priority at Wheaton remains the welfare of our employees our mining partners and the communities in which we operate. Despite the challenges posed by this pandemic 2020 was a very productive year and we were successful in delivering value back to our shareholders on so many fronts.,WPM,0.999525785446167,0.9990515703270257,Positive
I am pleased to announce that in 2020 Wheaton high quality portfolio of assets generated revenue of over 1 billion and operating cash flow of over 765 million both records for the company. And given Wheatons innovative dividend policy. This strong cash flow has resulted in a 30 increase to our minimum quarterly dividend relative to last year. In addition we were pleased to execute on our growth strategy amounting two accretive transactions in 2020 on the Marmato mine located in Colombia and the Cozamin mine located in Mexico.,WPM,0.9833259582519532,0.966651896626888,Positive

Thank you Randy and Good morning ladies and gentlemen. The companys precious metal interests produced 178800 gold equivalent ounces in the fourth quarter of 2020 comprised of 93100 ounces of gold 6.5 million ounces of silver and 5700 ounces of palladium. Relative to the fourth quarter of the prior year this represented a decrease of 4 on a gold equivalent basis with lower production at Salobo and 777 resulting from the temporary suspension of operations at each mine site being partially offset by the mining of highergrade material at Antamina.,WPM,0.9721225500106812,0.9442450667888325,Positive
On a gold equivalent basis sales volumes decreased 3 in line with the lower production levels as at December 31 2020 ounces produced but not delivered or PBND amounted to approximately 133000 gold equivalent payable ounces representing approximately 2.2 months of payable production. This amount of PBND is consistent with the average PBND balance of approximately 139000 gold equivalent ounces over the preceding four quarters.,WPM,0.8191882967948914,0.6383763780453073,Positive
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 amounted to 286 million representing a 28 increase relative to Q4 2019 primarily due to a 33 increase in the average realized gold equivalent price partially offset by the 3 decrease in sales volumes. Of this revenue 57 was attributable to gold 39 to silver and 4 to palladium. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 69 to 162 million once again highlighting the leverage our business model provides to increasing precious metal prices.,WPM,0.0163708329200744,-0.967259506737892,Negative
Cash based GA expenses amounted to 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 representing a decrease of 2 million from Q4 2019 primarily due to lower accrued costs associated with performance share units or PSUs which was partially offset by higher charitable donations with the company donating nearly 1 million relative to the previously announced 5 million community support and response fund related to the COVID19 pandemic.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Interest costs for the fourth quarter of 2020 amounted to 1 million resulting in an effective interest rate on outstanding debt of 1.2 as compared to 8 million of interest costs and an effective interest rate of 3.62 incurred in Q4 2019 with the average outstanding debt balance decreasing 39 during the most recently completed quarter and being 63 lower than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net earnings amounted to 157 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 more than double that generated in Q4 2019. Basic adjusted earnings per share increased 101 to 0.33 compared to 0.17 per share in the prior year. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2020 amounted to 208 million or 0.46 per share compared to 132 million or 0.29 per share in the prior year representing a 57 increase on a per share basis.,WPM,0.99191814661026,0.9838362835861942,Positive
Based on the companys dividend policy the companys Board has declared a dividend of 0.13 per share an increase of 8 compared to the prior quarter payable to shareholders of record on March 26 2021.

Relative to 2021 the company is setting the dividend floor at 0.13 per share a 30 increase from the floor that was established relative to 2020 highlighting the continued strength of the companys operating cash flows and the benefits of the companys unique dividend policy whereby dividend distributions are targeted at 30 of operating cash flow.,WPM,0.9949952960014344,0.9899905860367932,Positive
During the fourth quarter of 2020 the company repaid 293 million on the revolving facility and made dividend payments of 47 million. With these cash outflows being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of First Majestic shares in the amount of 113 million. Overall net cash outflows amounted to 17 million in Q4 2020 resulting in cash and cash equivalents at December 31st of 193 million. This combined with the 195 million outstanding under the revolving facility resulted in a net debt position as at December 31st of only 2 million.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the year ended December 31 2020 production on a gold equivalent basis met the companys revised guidance and was within 2 of the original guidance despite the various shutdowns in the second quarter resulting from the COVID19 pandemic. Despite the pandemic sales volumes were virtually unchanged relative to 2019 primarily due to relative changes to the ounces produced but not delivered.,WPM,0.7850585579872131,0.5701168597441075,Positive
Revenue for the year amounted to a record 1.1 billion the first time in the companys history that weve broken the 1 billion mark. Of this revenue 60 was attributable to gold sales 36 to silver and 4 to palladium. On a gold equivalent basis average realized commodity prices rose by 28 in 2020 leading to an increase in gross margin of 69. Cash based GA expenses in 2020 amounted to 60 million representing an increase of 11 million from 2019 with the increase being primarily related to higher crude costs associated with the PSUs and higher charitable donations.,WPM,0.0104452669620513,-0.9791106457177675,Negative
For 2021 the company estimates that nonstockbased GA expenses which exclude expenses relating to the value of stock options and PSUs will amount to 42 million to 45 million. Interest costs for 2020 amounted to 12 million a decrease of 33 million relative to 2019 resulting in an effective interest rate on outstanding debt of 2.03. Basic adjusted earnings per share increased 106 to a 1.12 compared to 0.54 per share in the prior year.,WPM,0.8813849687576294,0.7627697961150384,Positive
Cash flow from operations amounted to 765 million an increase of 53 as compared to 2019 primarily due to the higher commodity prices. This translated into operating cash flow per share of a 1.71 compared to a 1.12 in 2019.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Having ended 2020 in a neutral net debt position the capacity provided by the 2 billion revolving credit facility combined with the strong forecast operating cash flows positions the company very well to satisfy its funding commitments and sustain its dividend policy while at the same time having the flexibility to consummate additional accretive precious metal purchase agreement.,WPM,0.9989582300186156,0.997916458795344,Positive
That concludes the financial summary and with that I turn the call back over to Randy.,WPM,0.7583529949188232,0.5167057017717969,Positive
Thank you Gary. We are pleased to reiterate our 2021 and longterm production guidance previously announced in February. For 2021 Wheatons estimated attributable production is forecast to range between 370000 to 400000 ounces of gold 22 million to 24 million ounces of silver and 40000 to 45000 gold equivalent ounces of cobalt and palladium amounting to total gold equivalent production of approximately 720000 to 780000 ounces.,WPM,0.9399698972702026,0.8799397229789037,Positive
In 2021 gold production is forecast to increase mainly driven by growth at Salobo San Dimas and Constancia. Silver production is forecast to increase as additional ounces from Cozamin and Kino Hill are expected. Palladium production is expected to remain stable in 2021 and for the first time we have cobalt production from the Voiseys Bay mine with our first shipments having already been received in February.,WPM,0.956270158290863,0.9125402644516614,Positive
Looking forward we anticipate steady organic growth building over the next five years with gold equivalent production averaging 810000 ounces per year growing to 830000 ounces per year over a 10year time horizon. Average production over the next five years and 10 years is expected to increase primarily due to continued production growth from Salobo Constancia Peasquito and Stillwater as well as incremental ounces from the Marmato Cozamin and Voiseys Bay streams.,WPM,0.1271349191665649,-0.745731202203752,Negative
While Hudbays progress on the Rosemont project appears promising production from Rosemont is not included in the Wheaton five year guidance but is reflected in the 10 year forecast. And lastly although Barrick continues to advance a comprehensive review of the PascuaLama project and Pan American continues advancing discussions on Navidad without any framework on timing Wheaton does not currently include any production from these projects in its longterm forecast.,WPM,0.8082963228225708,0.6165924171164139,Positive
On the corporate development front despite travel restrictions our team was busier than ever in 2020 announcing two new streaming agreements and reviewing numerous other opportunities. We quickly adapted to the new environment and developed alternative methods for due diligence allowing us to continue to thoroughly review potential new acquisitions.,WPM,0.9926031827926636,0.9852063567676286,Positive
We were pleased to add two high quality assets to our portfolio a silver and gold stream on the Marmato project located in Colombia and a silver stream on the Cozamin mine in Mexico which were welcoming back into our asset base after our previously Cozamin ended in 2017. We believe both these projects demonstrates strong upside potential and will provide our shareholders with further opportunities for organic growth.,WPM,0.9953603148460388,0.9907206241611386,Positive
Our corporate development pipeline remains robust and looking ahead we will continue to focus on acquiring accretive precious metal streams that complement our high quality portfolio. The importance of delivering shareholder value while minimizing our impacts and supporting our local communities was never more evident than in 2020.,WPM,0.9804609417915344,0.9609218602906824,Positive
And as a streaming company we recognized that the stronger our partners are the stronger we are. So to support our mining partners and local communities we launched a 5 million fund to help address and alleviate the impacts of this pandemic which more than doubled our existing community investment budget.,WPM,0.99970805644989,0.999416112551756,Positive
At the end of 2020 over 3 million of that had been deployed in support of initiatives with our mining partners and frontline organizations including food banks shelters and hospitals. Wheaton has always strived to be a sustainable leader in the precious metal streaming space and this year we significantly increased our disclosure around ESG risk management through the release of our inaugural sustainability report.,WPM,0.7765403985977173,0.5530805308106725,Positive
We were honored to be recognized by several ESG rating providers for our performance in this area with sector leading scores. Most recently Wheaton was ranked by Sustainalytics as the top precious metals company. And perhaps more impressively in the global top 50 out of over 12000 companies across all sectors.,WPM,0.931937038898468,0.8638739966595153,Positive
As we look forward our work in this arena will only grow in importance. While we are proud of the steps we have taken thus far we recognize the sustainability is a journey and we are estimated as ever to constant and continual improvement and ensuring that we leave a positive impact.,WPM,0.9924153089523317,0.9848306088630017,Positive
In summary despite the unprecedented challenges of this year Wheaton has emerged stronger than ever with a sustainable foundation and a very promising future. We achieved both record revenue and cash flow levels and exceeded the midpoint of our production guidance for the ninth consecutive year.,WPM,0.0879443287849426,-0.8241124296858489,Negative
For the first time we introduced 10year production guidance demonstrating our belief in the steady longterm expected organic growth from our portfolio.,WPM,0.9952304363250732,0.9904608669643802,Positive
We listed on the London Stock Exchange in order to broaden our investment base to those looking for exposure to precious metals and to provide another point of entry for new internationally based shareholders to invest in Wheaton. With our value creating business model commitment to operating responsibly and focus on high quality assets we continue to provide investors with what we consider to be the best vehicle for investing into precious metals.,WPM,0.9999797940254213,0.9999595880267551,Positive
And finally on the backdrop of global uncertainty I consider our privilege our responsibility as good corporate citizens to continue to provide support where it is needed the most. It is times like these when assisting our most vulnerable is of the utmost importance it is simply the right thing to do.,WPM,0.9970811605453492,0.9941623176111687,Positive

QuestionandAnswer Session,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now conduct a questionandanswer session. Operator instructions Your first question comes from Tyler Langton with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.,WPM,0.964319109916687,0.9286381772984131,Positive
Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe just starting with Salobo. I know you mentioned sort of youre expecting higher production sort of this year. Can you just talk a little bit about the profile you expect for this year and the next couple of years its kind of maybe relative to sort of the more normal levels that we saw in 2019,WPM,0.9999874234199524,0.9999748468249123,Positive
Sure Tyler. And thanks again for picking up coverage of Wheaton appreciate having you on board and joining the team or the family. On the Salobo Salobo its all very exciting what we see over the next few years at Salobo. Obviously I think theyre about mi60 68 mechanically completed the end of the year on the Phase 3 expansion. And thats expected the turn on the switches sometime in 2022. And theyre hopeful to sort of to get the completion test satisfied on that third phase of expansion by the end of 2022.,WPM,1.0,1.0,Positive
And so as I said a 50 increase in throughput the current practice at the mine site is that they stockpile lower grade material in common with a lot of the large open pit copper mines around the world. They stockpile lower grade material and focus on processing higher grade material through the mill thats current practice. They havent made a final decision yet as to their approach once the third phase opensup.,WPM,0.0028774142265319,-0.9942463602103951,Negative
Economically it makes sense for a stockpiled approach and in fact weve got some incentives provided to continue to hopefully push Vale down that path in terms of continuing the stockpiling approach. But they havent made that decision yet. So its a little bit tough for us to give an accurate forecast over the next few years in terms of how Phase 3 is going to impact production.,WPM,0.9811065793037416,0.9622131360847572,Positive
Our approach in our production forecast is that weve assumed that theyre not going to stockpile that. Were going to push things through. So we think thats a pretty conservative approach. We think it has an inverse conservative aspect to our own production forecast for 2022 and beyond. Because economically we do think it does make sense for them to continue this stockpiling approach in setting aside lower grade materials and pushing higher grade materials through the mill.,WPM,0.9999672174453736,0.9999344348516674,Positive
A particular excitement though on top of that is the back in December Vale again announced the Phase 4 expansion. Its the first time that theyve discussed it publicly. Weve had obviously discussions with them extensively on this but theyve discussed it or released it publicly.,WPM,0.9810616970062256,0.9621233714362212,Positive
And that would involve another increase in equal increase of capacity which would take it from 90000 tonnes per day up to 120000 tonnes per day. And expectations are that they would have that up and running by 2027. And so lots of lots of activity at Salobo lots of growth at Salobo. The resource we have released our updated resources and you can see the growth on that side and so this deposit continues to deliver for us.,WPM,0.9802647829055786,0.9605295422849311,Positive
Okay. Thats helpful. And then just switching to sort of MA. I mean you mentioned some of the pipeline remains robust. Can you just talk a little bit about sort of the types of deals youre seeing in terms of size and whether its more base metal producers looking to do precious metal streams or on the precious metal side just any color there will be great.,WPM,0.9999991655349731,0.9999983310689515,Positive
Tyler Im going to let Haytham answer that one. He leads our corporate development front. So Haytham youre on the line,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure. Thanks Ryan. And good morning Tyler. How are you,WPM,0.9999572038650512,0.9999144076790853,Positive
Yup morning.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Just to give you a bit of an overview its been pretty busy since the new year started lots of new opportunities to look at theyre primarily development stage opportunities that fit into a lot of into our early deposit structure which weve done a few times. And thats where we take precious metals as a byproduct from a basement mine.,WPM,0.8927494287490845,0.7854987296454488,Positive
These types of opportunities obviously is where streaming works best. Theres also some opportunities that focus on balance sheet repair and so expansion stage opportunity as well where streaming can actually fund some of those expanses. The fact that streaming is being considered for all these areas actually further highlights the competitive cost of capital as streams provide.,WPM,0.233884572982788,-0.532231767315726,Negative
But there are some royalty factors out there that weve seen in the past. But I can tell you theres nothing that made sense from a Wheaton perspective in large part because of their size or because they come with a significant amount of nonprecious metal revenues. Were going to continue to focus on the larger I would say development stage and expansion stage opportunities were seeing right now.,WPM,0.9842486381530762,0.9684972575290547,Positive
I would just add that what were seeing is a lot of base metals growth base metal companies with the kick up in copper prices and other base metals theres a lot of companies that are now looking at putting back into the ground. And so thats probably the biggest changes. And then of course a lot of those assets have precious metal byproduct streams that will provide a good competitive source of capital to help these companies grow.,WPM,0.9992280006408693,0.9984560003614431,Positive
Great thanks so much.,WPM,0.995893657207489,0.9917873095198331,Positive
Your next question comes from Ralph Profiti Eight Capital. Please go ahead.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Randy I just had one and I wanted to come back to Salobo. And the potential for Phase 4. Should we be thinking about that as sort of more of an underground operation perhaps even moving to a block cave Or is this just sort of a systemic extra 12 million tonnes per annum being tacked on,WPM,0.9998540282249452,0.9997080562758784,Positive
And then and I guess the second question is when you think about that incremental investment that Wheaton would be inclined to pursue. Should we just sort of take the old agreement which would come in around say 900 million contribution,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah so I mean I actually personally believe that there is potential for block cave ultimately but I can tell you that the reserves that we have within open pit at Salobo are going to be  the Phase 4 expansion would be related to expansion of open pit operations that wouldnt be related to any any of the block cave side. But theres no doubt that long term potential for underground operations at Salobo does exist is just we still got I think 20 plus 30 plus years of reserves in front of us even with the expansion throughput there. And so I think itll be an open pit for a very very long time. And Phase 4 is related to open pit production. And then sorry second part of the question.,WPM,0.9559818506240844,0.9119636487744143,Positive
The reality is Vale has one opportunity to ask us for payment and we would expect that they would ask us for payment on the completion of phase 3 and thats a payment of somewhere in the neighborhood of  assuming that they complete  satisfy the completion test in 2022 of 570 million to 670 million and thats the last of our contingent payments related to Salobo. So if they expand to Phase 4 there is no additional payment that Wheaton would make.,WPM,0.1720750629901886,-0.6558508609836464,Negative
Yeah just to reiterate its onetime option that Vale have to collect an expansion payment. And so its their choice as to collect it at the end of Phase 3 or reserve it till the end of the phase 4. The payment of course increases with scale but decreases with time. And so its we fully expect them to be exercising that onetime option at the end of the phase once they satisfy the completion test on phase 3.,WPM,0.7759469747543335,0.5518936824164882,Positive
I got it. Much clearer now. Okay. Thanks very much.,WPM,0.9995704889297484,0.9991409773474795,Positive
Great Ralph. Thanks.,WPM,0.9989628195762634,0.9979256379161108,Positive
Your next question comes from Josh Wolfson RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey Josh.,WPM,0.8045236468315125,0.609047060636914,Positive
Thanks hi good morning. Continuing on the theme at Salobo here with this next opportunity on the stockpiling is there any sort of timeline that you can provide in terms of when we could expect and update and ingest maybe from a technical perspective is there anything to prevent the company from making this decision at a later date versus before the expansion is finished.,WPM,0.9997186660766602,0.9994373318179439,Positive
Well so the driving from a critical timeline perspective the only real difference at the site itself would be a bit of surface preparation but its the mobile equipment fleet size that would have to be adjusted. And in my experience all that takes as 1800 Caterpillar Komatsu both find a way to get that. And so thats not a critical that doesnt take a lot of time to make adjustments to in terms of the size of the mobile fleet.,WPM,0.9998409748077391,0.9996819494259053,Positive
But obviously the slightly larger mobile fleet is going to be stockpiling some of the material versus feeding it all to the mill. It just means more material being moved on a daily basis. And so thats kind of the critical path coming from the other end back. We have the updated resource which is now public. But we dont have the updated reserve yet because we havent actually made the final decision as to what plan is going forward.,WPM,0.0238097310066223,-0.9523817016969334,Negative
But the fact that the resource is in place means its really the matter of their engineering teams their technical teams the entire group sort of coming down to that position. Were of course hopeful that it happen sometime the area the better discussion gives us that much more clarity on a go forward basis. And we definitely dangled the incentives there from the different in the expansion payments that we make. And so were hopeful that its sometime in the first half of this year were confident that it will be sometime this year. But it should be in the first half of this year.,WPM,0.9839544296264648,0.9679088401251079,Positive
Okay fits here. And along the other operations for Vale for Voiseys Bay could you provide an update on how that operation will I guess ramp up or look like over the course of this year given youre going to get on the open pit material but the end were ramping up and then a follow on question to that historically one of the opportunities cited has been maybe cobalt marketing just given the jurisdiction of the asset operates in. And if you have any views on that today with the production commencing that would be an interest,WPM,0.2087786197662353,-0.5824437036774778,Negative
Sure. Okay. Well lets start off with the actual asset itself. So youre correct. I mean the underground was the delayed meaning is a result of some suspensions in production that they had on site last year as a result of the pandemic. In a weird way its a little bit of a positive for us because material that would have been mined last year was pushed into this year but it has delayed the start of the underground.,WPM,0.1354749202728271,-0.7290511900491656,Negative
For us its not really a ramp up because the production levels are pretty consistent from open pit to underground in terms of the material. So were getting pretty good production flows already from the open pit. And its as of January 1st irrespective of whether it comes from open pit or underground. And so as the underground does come into play itll obviously offset and weve got the open pit there as a dampening device to make sure that we have been consistent production from the pit itself. So things are looking good there.,WPM,0.9998393654823304,0.9996787307731694,Positive
From the marketing side I can tell you we went through a product marketing request for proposals and we had very very strong interest in our product. We ultimately did select a marketing agent that is working through. This is a product thats well known its been produced for a long time and so there is great high demand for the cobalt from Voiseys Bay. And so were pretty happy with what weve seen in terms of  weve now seen our first sales and were pretty happy with the way thats handling.,WPM,0.998924970626831,0.9978499399721266,Positive
The recent pricing action in cobalt and some of the challenges that weve seen elsewhere around the world from other production has really sort of timed itself very well for us to start receiving our cobalt production here. And so this is a new product for us. And its a new method of marketing for us in terms of being a bulk product versus story or precious metals. And so were really looking at these first couple of years as an opportunity to learn more about this market and see if theres ways we can further optimize it.,WPM,0.9985787868499756,0.997157572005732,Positive
Great thank you.,WPM,0.981493890285492,0.9629877585099691,Positive
Thanks Josh.,WPM,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Your next question comes from Cosmos Chiu from CIBC. Please go ahead.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi. Thanks Randy Gary and team. And great to see the dividend increase here. Maybe my questions are on the two new acquisitions here. Maybe first off on my Marmato. I see that the first payment is 34 million second payment is 4 million but they have not been paid yet. Im just wondering the timing in terms of that payment. And then also when would you start receiving production from that asset Is it when you pay that first payment And then as a follow on Ill ask those questions later on.,WPM,0.998437225818634,0.996874449774295,Positive
Great. Appreciate the little bit of pile of questions at a time. So yeah no the payments havent been made yet because there is some tenure issues that had to be clarified down there. And that is in process. It looks like its going to be happening very very soon here right now. And yes we will get a bit of production from the upper zone which is currently in production. It does date back to I cant remember which date but dates back to last year. And so we will get a bit of an inventory of production that has built up over that time once the payments made.,WPM,0.0277284979820251,-0.9445441630745907,Negative
Sorry go ahead. Haytham.,WPM,0.7975841164588928,0.595167991619105,Positive
July 1st date back.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
July 1st. Yeah. So date back to July 1st. So itll be a nice little bump. But its not thats not the reason with Marmato. The reason was in Marmato is for that lower dethrones. And all it takes is a good look at the drilling results that the companies achieve there. Were actually really excited about the geological potential and where that project where we think that project can go. And then when you look at the new management team coming in there is a long history of being able to build from projects like this. And so were pretty excited about that project.,WPM,0.996748983860016,0.9934979638445165,Positive
And Cosmos just to make sure youre aware. Weve not built any production yet even though it accrues back to July 1st. Weve not built any production in 2024 Marmato. Nor have we for foreclosed a debt those will both be chewed up in Q1 once payments are made.,WPM,0.2310333847999572,-0.5379341470802709,Negative
Okay yes that was actually my followon question in terms of when  so its going to be in Q1 that we see slightly higher production for both likely Marmato and also Cozamin because Cozamin youve made the entire payment already so thats coming in Q1 but Marmato maybe Q1 as well.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
As long as we do make that payment we do anticipate I can tell you were all prepped to make that payment. Its just a question of getting the final Ts crossed Is dotted. So as long as that happens in the next few weeks and yes. And Cozamin is accrued as of December 1st so its not as long.,WPM,0.9318115711212158,0.8636230609554416,Positive
For sure. And then I dont think I saw that in the MDA. But again I dont think its huge Randy. But how much have you sort of factored in in terms of 2021 guidance from these two assets here or is that something that you can share with us,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Those are both factored in. We did include Marmato. Again Marmato is very small until we get to the deep zone as Randy alluded to. Cozamin that we certainly had  did that acquisition in December that we announced it. So that would be certainly included in 2021. I can tell you though we did use a conservative approach. We do think Capstone maybe not in 2021 but further on will grow production. So we think theres upside there for sure in the five and 10 year guidance. But it is in our current guidance.,WPM,0.9974055290222168,0.9948110549515814,Positive
Some of the initiatives that Capstones got underway and Cozamin will definitely improve production number there. So and we expect to see that coming over the next couple of years.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And Randy could you remind us in terms of the timing of the deep zone at Marmato potential timing,WPM,0.1905240416526794,-0.6189528816657555,Negative
I think its 2023. But Haytham youre on the line do you have that,WPM,0.768409788608551,0.5368193011398918,Positive
Yeah you bet. I think it is late 2023 early 2024 is the expected timing.,WPM,0.8101397156715393,0.6202792050118475,Positive
Great. And then maybe another stream here Keno Hill Im seeing that the mills started commissioning in November 2020. Just given the timing and then concentrate and whatnot when should we start expecting contribution from that stream And to your knowledge how is the startup going,WPM,0.9999213814735411,0.9998427628533617,Positive
So the startup was a little bit challenged mainly because of COVID risk management. October November there was a second wave sort of came through. And so there was an increase in restrictions and then it definitely made the startup challenging for them in terms of getting staff in there safely and making sure that they were maintaining high risk management protocols that that definitely made it a little bit more challenging for them to get it up and running smoothly.,WPM,0.9913792014122008,0.9827583925476027,Positive
But they were successful in getting first production through. Thats a concentrate for us that gets shipped off. And so were hopeful that as we seem to be coming out of this second wave and that things will lighten up a bit for Electrico in terms of getting it up to full speed. They are getting some good very very impressive grades out of the underground.,WPM,0.906255066394806,0.8125100210368761,Positive
And so the things do look very promising from that front. But so we fully expect that coming spring they should be getting closer and closer to full production levels.,WPM,0.869062066078186,0.7381239760660983,Positive
Yes. So Cosmos we didnt book any production in 2020 for Keno Hill. But youll see a start to a crude production starting probably in the first quarter. I dont see any reason why we wouldnt have production in the first quarter.,WPM,0.9809554815292358,0.961910940355623,Positive
Great. Thanks Patrick. And then maybe one more question here. In Q4 usually producers like to catchup sales versus production. I guess we didnt really see it in Q4 2020 this year maybe due to COVID19 impact. Any insight in terms of when that might reverse in terms of sales exceeding production in a later quarter Is that going to be in Q1 Q2 any kind of insight there that of at this point in time,WPM,0.9990766048431396,0.9981532085855058,Positive
Well and youre right last year because of the expansions in the second quarter and into part of the third quarter in some places  sorry first quarter and into the second quarter in some places it had a bit of an odd effect to normal produce but not yet sold. But we expect the numbers are not too far off of where we average on a quarterly basis.,WPM,0.9316034317016602,0.8632067818682085,Positive
And so we do expect it to normalize. Its always been our experience that the fourth quarter is the one where sales get pushed because everyone squeezes the sort of the inventory pipeline to try and boost year end results. And so thats usually the incentive for it. And thats one of the reasons why we typically do see that in the fourth quarter.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So I would hazard a guess that once we get back to normal levels which I think we are pretty close to right now its probably not going to be until the fourth quarter again that we see something like that Cosmos probably again the incentive to just sort of make the yearend results look a little bit better is a continual objective Right.,WPM,0.8863459825515747,0.7726918296169218,Positive
Thanks again Randy Gary Patrick and Haytham. And those are the questions I have for everyone stay safe and have a good weekend.,WPM,0.999542236328125,0.999084472110553,Positive
Your next question comes from Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning. Theres a lot of  good morning theres a lot of talk in the industry about rate of return on screens going forward. So Im just kind of curious with your sell down of First Majestic how you think about the rate of return on what I would call the standard math may 2018 deal because when I sort of look at this you put out 220 million.,WPM,0.9946006536483764,0.9892013008602265,Positive
Ive got my math right and correct me if Im wrong you got 94 back already in cash. But now youve also sold 151 million shares give or take a First Majestic and you have more to go and you still have the stream So do you count or do you look at that sale of First Majestic when you do those rate of return calculations Im just curious how you philosophically think about that given the significance of the First Majestic position,WPM,0.8072282075881958,0.6144561853743704,Positive
Look philosophically I look at it as we had an opportunity to do the stream close him in with Capstone and one of the ways to pay for that was to sell out of the shares of First Majestic and sort of put that money back into Silver in the ground and that pulls them in which is a good long life asset. Were strong supporters of First Majestic and what theyre doing in San Dimas. We think that that asset is perfectly suited for First Majestic.,WPM,0.0130419731140136,-0.9739172303183261,Negative
And I think some of the initiatives that theyve got underway is just going to make that asset even stronger than what it currently is now. Theyve got some good strong focus on putting first off drill holes into the ground which is always the first requirement in terms of making sure youve got the exploration potential and the resources that convert to reserves.,WPM,0.9678910970687866,0.9357821558607553,Positive
But also just the continued optimization of the mill improvements in terms of throughput and recovery rates and investing back into it. San Dimas is even after this morning San Dimas is First Majestic flagship. And so its always going to be a core focus of their investment. We were comfortable shareholders and supportive shareholders of them. But we saw an opportunity to also stay focused and were also very very bullish on silver. But were very comfortable with that. So in terms of rate of return Gary.,WPM,0.99974524974823,0.9994904991927738,Positive
Yeah. Look Brian you have to realize we view the San Dimas restructuring that we did back in 2018 as a very successful transaction and a real winwin transaction. One that has benefited First Majestic whos done a wonderful job with the asset with the exploration success that theyve had.,WPM,0.9378820657730104,0.8757640574956285,Positive
But the original stream we received  the current stream and the current stream we modified the stream so that we were getting about 60 of what we were previously getting and the 40 that we gave up we received 151 million of First Majestic shares. And so you have to take that in into account. So we got 370 million and then the Gold Corp gave us 10 million to get rid of their guarantee relative to that asset. So we received 380 million for the original stream.,WPM,0.8269574642181396,0.6539147221533788,Positive
Now weve received 156 million so far on December 31 2020 in proceeds from selling the First Majestic shares and we had about 100 million of First Majestic shares at year end. So lets call it 260 million relative to our original valuation of 151 million. So weve generated as at December 31 2020 about a 70 return on the First Majestic shares and thats reflective of the fantastic job that First Majestic has done with San Dimas.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And that combined with you have to remember we are dealing with about a 1200 gold price environment when we consummated that deal. So with gold being up over 40 since then. The combination of those two things has resulted in a very significant return. On the stream we have received over 94 million todate on the amended stream. And the mine life there has been extended significantly with the exploration success that First Majestic has had. So that I think was a very successful restructuring. And were very happy with the way that that asset is performing.,WPM,0.9997263550758362,0.999452709825462,Positive
Great. Thanks. So maybe just a second question on the Voiseys Bay deal technically and with all this talk about marketing and as youve mentioned its a premium product. Is the reference what is actually the reference price for the cobalt price that youre going to get post marketing I mean if we get into a situation where you had a twotiered market or something. It is technically  I just cant remember is it technically defined to reference a certain price Or is there some potential,WPM,1.0,1.0,Positive
Yeah Brian we currently have an agency agreement where we sell it with block prices over the period. And so obviously we monitor the spot market prices but each block that gets sold is assigned a price at the time of the transaction itself on a go forward basis. So theres a number of different reference points out there or reference prices out there.,WPM,0.0598380267620086,-0.8803250672370597,Negative
And obviously we monitor that and our agent monitors that in terms of how that moves forward but,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
But its not directly related to those agency prices. Its just there for reference.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah Brian its going to be difficult because theres used to be metals bullets but I think they may have changed their name. Was the reference  it was most applicable LME isnt a great proxy but what the LME price if you look at that will give you a proportional or directional movement. You can look at LME and you can see LME prices have gone from midteens to well into mid20s.,WPM,0.022892415523529,-0.9542163337566458,Negative
So over the past until late 2020 so just as we were starting to sell our first product and weve made our first sale pricing had very much improved. But as far as an exact number its going to be tough to forecast other than a directional move from LME unfortunately.,WPM,0.0117809176445007,-0.976439342760648,Negative
Right. But just so Im clear if I mean there is a philosophical discussion out there in the market that cobalt from Canada might be worth more than cobalt from lets say places in Africa. It would be a negotiated thing. And clients wanted to pay a premium for the stuff from Canada it would be negotiated price threeyear mark to your agency that technically you would get a premium if you could do that. And that existed in the market. Its not like its a cast and stone reference point anything,WPM,0.9999935626983644,0.9999871253890549,Positive
Exactly. Its a unique product that comes from Voiseys Bay and its got it has been  its in the marketplace as well known in the marketplace. And so theres people that really like this product and theyre the ones that are stepping up. Our first sale happened to someone that has been using Voiseys Bay cobalt for a long time and it was for a good price.,WPM,0.9765637516975404,0.953127475456879,Positive
Great thank you all for answering all my questions.,WPM,0.9990673661231996,0.9981347311346123,Positive
Thank you Brian.,WPM,0.9314355850219728,0.8628710883087449,Positive
Your next question comes from Richard Hatch from Berenberg. Please go ahead.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks very much. And good morning management and team and congrats on better detailed numbers. I got a few questions. The first one just Voiseys Bay I wonder if he might just be able to put a bit more meat on the bones of what you could potentially kind of realize in terms of production levels just on the various meals. I appreciate its quite difficult necessarily to have a full picture there. But would you be able to give us any kind of sort of stare on the various sort of three and four expansion what that could take production levels to,WPM,0.9933407306671144,0.9866814533957564,Positive
Well what I can tell you is the amount of tonnes that each one of those expansions relates to.,WPM,0.7508725523948669,0.5017448078064966,Positive
Currently the mine is running at around a 60000 tonne per day capacity. The Phase 3 will take it from 60000 to 90000 tonnes per day. And the Phase 4 the proposed Phase 4 its not definite yet by any means. But it sure looks like its shaping up will be another 30000 tonnes per day.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So it will take the mine ultimately from currently 60000 tonnes per day to 120000 tonnes per day which still when you look at copper mines around the world is a large open pit copper mines around the world its not the largest in the world by any means is thats a pretty normal operating rate. And in fact very similar to what we see at Peasquito where theres even higher strip ratios.,WPM,0.9987449645996094,0.9974899277030991,Positive
So now the question is what grade do they choose and stockpiling and its very tough. I mean we know that currently right now they are stockpiling lower grade material. They have been ever since they started up the back in 2012. And setting aside the lower grade material and building up a lowgrade stockpile which will ultimately at the very end of the mine life be processed through the mill. And they are doing that.,WPM,0.775168776512146,0.5503372850044281,Positive
And so current production levels sort of do reflect the stockpiling approach. Now we know that its easy for us to forecast and in fact thats what we have included in our longterm forward forecasts is assuming that they process all ore mined through the mill and do not stockpiling and stop stockpiling. And we feel that thats a very conservative base case we feel theres definitely outside of over and above that.,WPM,0.9953885674476624,0.9907771293980654,Positive
However the quantum of the amount of material that they stockpile if they keep on using the same practices they have right now you would imply that theres a possibility of some of a 50 increase this time around. But theres its just not going to be like that. Typically when you scale up in terms of capacity throughputs any crossover grades for stockpiling will drop a bit as you sort of adapt to that higher capacity to the mill.,WPM,0.0619500279426574,-0.8761010623580591,Negative
And so its a very broad spectrum of possible results. But they just its tough for us to put any more guidance on it other than the fact that were confident that itll be higher than what weve got in our corporate forecast. But the quantum higher really does come down to how much material they decide to set aside in the stockpiling campaign material they decided to move it through the mill.,WPM,0.2511727809906006,-0.4976553306909386,Negative
And it is an entire spectrum of results that its very flexible on their side. What I can again reinforces the fact that not only do we feel it makes economic sense for the continued stockpiling but there is a pretty healthy incentive as Gary mentioned earlier on but 100 million incentive over and above their expensive payment if they commit to continuous stockpiling program and focus our grade materials through the mill.,WPM,0.9692438840866088,0.9384877315090485,Positive
And so so the combination of strong economic  stronger economics plus that incentive we do hope that they make the decision but in the end its Vales decision as to their approach there. And I just wish I could give you more guidance on that but I cant.,WPM,0.0107973217964172,-0.9784065356293534,Negative
No. Thats helpful. Just a quick one on Rosemont. Randy you mentioned that you push that into your longterm guidance When do you have that coming on online in your new numbers,WPM,0.924842119216919,0.8496841488386087,Positive
Well we havent coming on about six years now. But thats we actually think Hudbay is making good progress on their discussions with in terms of the appeal of that decision and in fact Hudbays own guidance is that they expect to announce or hopefully get to a decision point sometime here within the next I think its a few months actually within this year definitely.,WPM,0.9941679239273072,0.9883358409022338,Positive
And so given that theres about a 2.5 to 3 year build time on happy and there is a reasonable chance that they could move forward. And even if theyre not successful in appealing the recent decision they do have the opportunity to try and shift the operations on the privately owned land and move forward it would be a smaller scale operation that really doesnt make sense. But sometimes you are forced to do things that dont make sense in order to get around these challenges.,WPM,0.2052043080329895,-0.5895923314048834,Negative
But they are definitely making good progress on that front. And were confident that theyll be successful. And in that event theres we think a pretty good chance itll come with it our fiveyear guidance but we just felt again to be on the conservative side were confident theyll get there. But even if it wasnt the five years we probably wouldnt see it until the fifth year that fiveyear guidance.,WPM,0.9312219619750975,0.8624438419603357,Positive
And so it really is its something thats going to be out. And I think good chance itll be six years old seven years old. And so weve got sort of supplying production through the six years  six to 10 of the 10year guidance.,WPM,0.8801376819610596,0.7602752210350161,Positive
Cool. Okay just quickly on the dividend. I mean spreadsheet dividend tight again grade CVO increasing I suppose youve got a balance sheet is going to move into net cash in Q1. Wheres your head at in terms of giving it a material hike My numbers maybe youre in a 5 to 6 free cash flow yield 1 1.5 dividend yield so maybe the states have to give it a bit more of a push. Do you think youd give it another year or two and see whether deal shape out just to give yourself that extra firepower Or do you think we could expect to see dividends pushed a bit higher for 12months,WPM,0.9997231960296632,0.9994463917293501,Positive
Well its important to keep in mind that we do average our dividend over the previous four quarters of cash flows. And so as we see this organic growth that weve just discussed over the next few years we know that theres going to be upward pressure on this dividend just by virtue of the fact that we do tie it to our cash flows. And if we see some renewed strength in precious metal prices thatll also put upward pressure on that dividend. And so its naturally going to be there.,WPM,0.9980610609054564,0.996122119499516,Positive
Richard I can tell you that that were focused on trying to add to our portfolio. And if were successful no we only do it into accretive. And if its high quality were very very selective I can tell you that our hit rate is about one and a 100 in terms of projects that we look at versus ones where we close on.,WPM,0.1541111469268798,-0.6917787145249336,Negative
And so we are very very selective about what we invest into. But our objective is to continue growing the company with ounces in the ground. And if were not successful that means that youre right this year were going to build up an incredible curvy strong cash balance on the balance sheet. And thats not where Id like to be.,WPM,0.0136322677135467,-0.9727366404155735,Negative
And what that means is that given the end of this year if we havent made any other significant acquisitions in terms of putting money back into the ground then we will definitely be entertaining the potential of increasing the payout ratio from 30 to possibly as high as 40 or 50. I dont see it jumping to 50. It would be the next natural step would be 40. But thats only going to come when we have the cash to give back to our shareholders were not going to borrow to give back to our shareholders.,WPM,0.0056873559951782,-0.9886264733233889,Negative
We will borrow to acquire ounces in the ground but our focus is on growing the company. But if we cant see good opportunities to grow the company then the money will come back to our shareholders.,WPM,0.2409612536430359,-0.5180783975591645,Negative
Yeah special dividend in consideration or not.,WPM,0.824505090713501,0.6490099722206426,Positive
Unlikely but time will tell if we start to get too large of a balance sheet. If we have too much cash on hand then those things can be done likely this year.,WPM,0.1208858788013458,-0.7582292903836313,Negative
Okay. Thank you. And my absolute last one is just that Indiscernible. If you were to look at the kind of pipeline to deals with the moment and I guess one of the other guys touched on it a bit earlier on. But look at the pipeline at the moment how confident are you that theres ones that have kind of  the pen is kind of hovering over the paper Or is it the case of theres still quite a lot of work to do before we kind of seen these slow on deals,WPM,0.9630593657493592,0.9261186874620246,Positive
Just to answer that question Richard I would say we probably have 10 to 12 100 million to 300 million opportunities in the pipeline that were constantly looking at and that we hope to be able to get a couple of those across the line. How confident am I I think were going to do everything we can to make sure that we add do accretive transactions. And Im fairly confident well be successful in 2021.,WPM,0.9999641180038452,0.9999282359649158,Positive
Thats helpful. Thanks for your time guys. Much appreciated.,WPM,0.9998016357421876,0.9996032712479064,Positive
Thank you Richard. One more question please.,WPM,0.9867655038833618,0.9735309919899655,Positive
Your last question comes from Trevor Turnbull Scotiabank. Please go ahead.,WPM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Trevor good to hear you.,WPM,0.9712839126586914,0.9425677910851187,Positive
Good to say so Randy and forgive me for the ultimate last syllable question. Could you just maybe briefly talk a little bit about the relationship between the copper and the gold And how if youre going to see sustained higher copper prices does that work towards Vale making a decision either one way or the other on the stockpiling issue in terms of the expansion,WPM,0.9814069271087646,0.9628138320528461,Positive
Theres no doubt it has an impact on that because they get 100 of the copper revenue and about 25 of the gold revenue. So the higher copper prices will definitely incentivize them to push that forward. There is on a more global corporate basis down there Vale has a very continually every time you ever see them present if theyre constantly focused on trying to expand their presence in base metals. They have a lot of exposure to iron ore and its a continual message that the expectation is to try and double the contribution from the base metals division of Vale. And Salobo Salobo 4 is continually referenced. I was at a panel discussion around this week where the BDAC where it was referenced.,WPM,0.9902820587158204,0.9805641058469452,Positive
And so we do think that stronger copper prices even provide more incentive for them to go down this path and try and reap some of the benefits of these copper prices today.,WPM,0.8951823115348816,0.7903644981172671,Positive
And sorry so just on the simplest level higher copper grades does correlate with the higher gold grades. So it all works in the same direction.,WPM,0.0676677525043487,-0.8646656064186136,Negative
Its beautiful that way isnt it,WPM,0.945295751094818,0.8905914369770507,Positive
Yeah. All right. Thanks Randy.,WPM,0.9898687601089478,0.9797375081405093,Positive
Thank you Trevor. And thank you everyone. In closing we do believe Wheaton is very well positioned to continue delivering value to our shareholders for a number of different reasons. Firstly by having low and predictable costs that results in some of the highest margins in the entire precious metal space resulting in very strong operating cash flows.,WPM,0.996160089969635,0.9923201753617379,Positive
Secondly through our steady organic growth profile and proven track record of the accretive quality acquisitions. Thirdly by offering our shareholders exposure to some of the highest quality mines in the world through our portfolio of long life low cost assets. And lastly by being a leader amongst precious metal streamers in sustainability through initiatives such as our CSR fund and strong support of our partners and the communities in which we live and operate.,WPM,0.8724045753479004,0.744808998590111,Positive
I do look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Stay healthy. Stay safe. Thank you.,WPM,0.9993197917938232,0.9986395827767747,Positive

Thanks John and good morning everyone. Id like to start by thanking our employees for their hard work during a very difficult but very successful restructuring process. A year ago Extraction had 323 employees. Today we have 121. With regret but out of necessity we reduced our headcount by 62 in 2020. We miss those folks and we sincerely appreciate the hard work turned in by our current staff who picked up the slack as we emerged from Chapter 11 this past January.,XOG,0.0001244843006134,-0.9997522233439823,Negative
Our restructuring process was difficult but its also positioned us for success in the current environment. Our streamlined staffing has increased efficiency and collaboration even during the pandemic and contributed to a reduction in cash GA of nearly 50. We equitized 1.3 billion in unsecured debt and preferred equity. We reduced our RBL borrowings from 600 million to the 254 million thats currently drawn under our revolver. We reduced our DC and LOE costs by over 20. Our run rate transportation and gathering expenses have declined by approximately 50 through the renegotiation of 7 of our key midstream and marketing contracts. And we eliminated the vast majority of our midstream minimum volume commitments as part of that same process.,XOG,0.9313843250274658,0.8627685682586241,Positive
One thing that didnt change during the restructuring is the quality of our property base both in terms of geology and concentration. Our yearend total proved PV10 value was 1.4 billion using March 1 strip pricing and our PDP PV10 was just under 1.2 billion. And today for the first time in a long time we have a balance sheet that complements the value of our asset base with a straightforward capital structure comprised of common equity and our borrowing base facility leverage of less than 1 times EBITDA and more than 250 million in available liquidity.,XOG,0.9988211989402772,0.9976423964753132,Positive
As a company we now have a new highly engaged Board of Directors and weve adopted a new business model focused on returns over growth low leverage scale economics to be achieved through consolidation and the generation of material free cash flow. Specifically with respect to our excess cash flow we expect to fully repay our outstanding debt this year so we will be debtfree by yearend. And we hope to institute a dividend policy over the same time frame.,XOG,0.7557045221328735,0.5114087530426699,Positive
From a governance perspective weve implemented a new compensation structure. All of managements incentive compensation and 100 of our directors annual stipends are paid in Extraction common shares. And the vesting of the majority of the management teams incentive comp is contingent on absolute shareholder return. We are not aware of another compensation structure in the industry that has greater alignment with the performance of the companys common stock.,XOG,0.804225504398346,0.6084507754151676,Positive
At the Board level weve also established the companys first ESG Committee as a followon to our corporate sustainability report which is available for your review on our website. The company has undertaken a series of ESG initiatives and you should look forward to an announcement in the near future that more specifically details our achievements and our strategy in this area.,XOG,0.9846708178520204,0.9693416174302207,Positive
Taken together our quality assets lowcost structure financial flexibility and continuing focus on responsible ESG policy enable Extraction to operate at the front end of the North American EP curve. As always we are focused first on safety in our operations. Financially however our strategy is generating significant cash returns maintaining low leverage and initiating distributions to our shareholders all while continuing to reduce our environmental impact.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And with that Ill turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer Matt Owens for an update on our operations.,XOG,0.8746671080589294,0.7493340667093198,Positive
Thanks Tom. By way of update after ceasing drilling and completion operations back in the second quarter of 2020 we still generated net sales volumes of 83000 BOE per day in the fourth quarter of 2020 of which was 62 liquids. This year we recommenced operations with 1 drilling rig on our Wake North pad and 1 completion crew on our GP pad both in Greeley. We are preparing the GP pad to be turned in line during the second quarter and the Wake North pad should begin production around the beginning of the third quarter.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
As Tom noted we are prioritizing cash returns in all of our operations and we expect to balance the allocation of our cash flow among reinvestment in our projects debt reduction and distributions to shareholders. We have also made the strategic decision to upspace relative to our historical drilling strategies. We believe this is the optimal way to allocate capital and maximize returns through decreasing cycle times and improving perwell EURs.,XOG,0.9994670152664183,0.9989340298974689,Positive
We have already begun this effort by completing 13 to 15 wells on the GP and Wake North pads which were originally planned for 20 to 24 wells each. And on 1 of our pads in Windsor we are drilling only the Codell formation as its economics are superior to the Niobrara. I wanted to highlight these first 3 pads in 2021 because they are concrete examples of how the company has shifted its development strategy with a rigorous focus on capital allocation and maximizing returns.,XOG,0.1149183213710784,-0.7701644123580531,Negative
With that I think were ready for QA.,XOG,0.9576873779296876,0.9153747054187691,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions. Our first question comes from Leo Mariani with KeyBanc.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Obviously you have a plan to reduce debt to zero at the end of the year here and you also talked about consolidation opportunities as well in the space. Certainly seems like the balance sheet is well positioned for that. I think in the press release you did talk about some leasehold acquisitions. But wanted to see if theres any other kind of chunkier deals that you may have your eyes on out there I know there are still some distressed private operators out there in the DJ. Maybe you can just kind of talk about that strategy over time.,XOG,0.9807708263397216,0.9615416297564681,Positive
Yes Leo its Tom. How are you doing this morning Id say 2 things. There is kind of a daytoday optimization that we do in our assets and those are largely cash transactions whether they are sales of noncore assets or acquisitions of working interest to increase our ownership in our existing projects. And literally were considering those and executing those on a weekly basis. And then there are the strategic transactions. I would say at any one point in time candidly were in dialogue with 1 or more parties about the possibility of transacting. And that I would say that the majority of those are equitybased transactions. And I also dont think that the mode that we are in is materially different than the mode of others in the basin and others in the industry. So I would say its a stated part of our strategy to consolidate and were pursuing it aggressively.,XOG,0.9990588426589966,0.9981176841960455,Positive
Okay. And then just maybe jumping over to kind of the existing operations here. Obviously you talked about a plan to kind of upspace with wider spacing. And just wanted to kind of get a sense when you sort of look at kind of current permits in hand across the company and kind of given the up space. What can you kind of tell us about the existing inventory even if its just kind of a high level number or XOG things that got 3 or 4 years of running room or whatever the number might be And then maybe to kind of add on that whats the plan in terms of further negotiations with some of the local municipalities And kind of where does that stand in terms of maybe adding new operator agreements or expanding existing ones on the acreage footprint,XOG,0.9993297457695008,0.9986594907399959,Positive
Leo this is Matt. Youre right we have really looked at our inventory with an upspacing perspective focusing on returns. We have some slides on that in our presentation that illustrates how we view it. But upspace count that the company has is that 432 locations and that was based off of when we did our original guidance. But as you can tell from the Slide 13 in our deck that obviously changes with commodity prices.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
But right now were comfortable with where the strip is at that we have about 430 upspace locations remaining which at our current rig pace and the fact that we drill mostly 2mileorlonger wells would be about 8 years of inventory. And as far as the other municipal operator agreements go we dont have any new ones that were currently working on. There are some that will be in the pipe shortly but theyre not anywhere near the size and scale of some of the ones that weve executed in the past such as Commerce City or Broomfield with  in terms of well counts. But we will continue adding small operator agreements to finish developing our acreage around the edges of some of those municipalities.,XOG,0.961695432662964,0.9233908196632981,Positive
Your next question comes from Patrick Sheffield with Beach Point Capital.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Just one housekeeping item. In the disclosure statement I recall there being a pretty sizable working capital trueup that needed to be paid this year and in the 100plus million range. And I saw your free cash flow guidance slide looks quite robust and youre going to end the year with no net debt. Is that  was that working capital which I thought was  maybe some chunk of it was by the tax payments Has that been kicked to a future year or was it overestimated Or what exactly is going on there,XOG,0.9745251536369324,0.9490502769054632,Positive
Hey Patrick this is Marianella. Thanks for joining the call. I would say we  that  if you look at Page 7 in our presentation we gave a 200 million working capital deficit. The yearend number since we were still in bankruptcy as of yearend is a little bit noisy. We do have to your point fairly large tax statements that we have made and will continue to make through April. Come April there will be a more normal course working capital deficit.,XOG,0.9994033575057985,0.9988067143003432,Positive
If you look at Page 7 we have made and well continue to make payments and working capital will tighten by about 60 million. And going forward given our new production and the new commodity price environment that should be our run rate production taxes going forward.,XOG,0.9969763159751892,0.993952628345864,Positive
But your yearend  I mean your estimate of having no net debt at the end of the year takes into account the payments that youre making in April,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Absolutely. Its all in. And we merged with  that there was about 3 chunks of production taxes we made in January February March. The 1 in April is just a normal course annual tax payment. So really the delinquent property taxes that we did not pay before bankruptcy were all paid through this month. And in April well have another large bill. But like I said thats equivalent to much higher commodity price and much higher production than we saw in 2019. And so once April is behind us youll see that more normal course. But yes the free cash flow guidance is all in after working capital payments.,XOG,0.9907459020614624,0.9814917930911737,Positive
Operator Instructions Our next question comes from Jeff Robertson with Water Tower Research.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
A question. Tom can you talk philosophically about the reinvestment rate that you plan for the business in the context of dividend and generating free cash flow out into 2022,XOG,0.9334179162979126,0.866835753223749,Positive
Sure. How are you doing Jeff Thanks for the question. First of all I dont think we consider ourselves beholden to any set percent of cash flow going in any 1 direction other than to say that we want to direct our cash flow every year to reinvestment in our projects to debt repayment and to shareholder distributions. Those latter 2 I think the choice will become much more current for us towards the end of the year certainly second half of the year probably the fourth quarter after we are in a position where weve paid down most of our debt.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And what were weighing is distributions to shareholders versus reinvestment. Any given quarter the things that factor into it are economic inventory and commodity prices and our dividend policy which is yet to be determined. But we are  I think we are set on imposing on ourselves a distribution policy that deals with on the 1 hand delevering and on the other hand returning cash to our shareholders and doing that on a continuous basis once we get our leverage down a little bit further. Does that answer your question,XOG,0.9203907251358032,0.8407813553698988,Positive
Yes. I guess what is part of what youre saying that youre going to instill discipline in the capital allocation process by how much you reinvest versus how much you potentially have for distributions,XOG,0.9267488718032836,0.8534976562843657,Positive
Well first of all I would say our capital allocation process is already pretty darn disciplined. Weve got a Board and a management team that are very very focused on making sure that any investment we make in any of our projects is highly economic and is accretive to our return on capital employed on a corporate basis.,XOG,0.9999490976333618,0.9998981952060433,Positive
But I think the question you may be getting at is when we sit around on a quarterly basis and decide how were going to allocate capital we are very rigorously going to look at the benefit of distributing cash to shareholders as an alternative. And that probably is different than past practices. Id also say that its hard to envision a scenario even with commodity prices very high where we would not allocate a material percentage of our cash flow to shareholder distributions or debt repayment if it happens to be this year.,XOG,0.1681476235389709,-0.6637057445679574,Negative
A question if I can follow up maybe for Matt. On Slide 13 where you talk about the despacing I think you said Matt that the current numbers are based on strip pricing. Im just curious how does the changes in prices and changes in costs how does it affect the ideal spacing for your development,XOG,0.8814235925674438,0.7628470437807107,Positive
Yes youre correct. Page 13 is illustrative of how we kind of are looking at each development area in our inventory. Obviously were not going to make realtime changes based on weekly moves in the commodity price but were going to be more focused on what it looks like 12 to 24 months down the road. But if there is a longterm uplift in the strip or its not backwardated as much that could shift us to the right slightly on this plot on Page 13.,XOG,0.9992172718048096,0.9984345426765338,Positive
But really the main goal were going for here is not necessarily maximizing our net present value its really maximizing the return on each incremental dollar we invest in the ground. So how much more CapEx or how much more NPV are we getting net present value are we getting for each capital dollar that were putting in the ground. And on this particular example that were showing here the limit is in our minds right around 12.,XOG,0.8702800273895264,0.7405599001407028,Positive
Our next question comes from Dave Zimmerman with Eaton Vance.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Jeff just asked my question about the spacing. A little more elaboration. It sounds like it was driven by incremental well economics as opposed to whatever was driving it in the past. Appears that other basin operators are doing similar things. How much does the spacing approach vary among your 3 or 4 large areas How dispersed is the quality of your regional areas,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Dave thanks for the question. It does vary. On that same slide there 13 youll see in the first bullet point we mentioned its anywhere between 6 and 15 wells per section. And that really covers our acreage position in the core from the northern end in Windsor all the way down to the southern end in Hawkeye. For example the lower end of that scale would be the acreage that we have in the Hawkeye Area. And the main reason for that is just the amount of formations there.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So in Hawkeye if you remember the Codell formation is not present. Its a Niobrara only. So down there we are looking at about 6 wells per section in the Niobrara. As you move north and you get into Broomfield North Hawkeye you get into Greeley we have the Niobrara and the Codell formation there so they both play in. And right now the best economics that the company has is really the remaining pads we have in the Greeley area and those will be the ones tipping the scale towards the upper end around 15 wells per section.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Great. So essentially youll be drilling your best wells first no question about it presumably right,XOG,0.993693232536316,0.9873864575543749,Positive
Thats the general plan that we have over the next few years.,XOG,0.1365902125835418,-0.7268206040982035,Negative
Yes. And then just the last 1. I thought that Hawkeye required some meaningful infrastructure midstream infrastructure spending before its really ready to develop. Can you just speak to that order of magnitude of potential midstream requirements to get Hawkeye ready Or is Hawkeye already all set,XOG,0.9576923847198486,0.9153847190050597,Positive
Thats a good question. So when we first purchased the asset a couple of years ago youre correct there was very little midstream infrastructure down in the area particularly for the gas processing and theres actually no oil infrastructure in place at that time. Over the last couple of years a large public company drilled some more wells down in that area spread out across their position. Its since been purchased by a private operator who has continued the development.,XOG,0.9518259763717652,0.903651895315585,Positive
But they have continued to expand their gathering infrastructure with respect to gas and it covers most of their position which is really the Western flank of our position. And were not too far from the gathering infrastructure for the pads that we want to drill in the next few years. And then theres also an oil midstream company who has come down and started laying gathering lines. So while its not as built out and robust as it is up in the Wattenberg Field there is continuous expansion going on both with the gas gathering and the oil gathering down in that area.,XOG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And that concludes our QA. I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Tyree for any further remarks.,XOG,0.7745722532272339,0.5491442377234923,Positive

Thank you David and welcome everyone to our yearend 2020 call. Lets start with a review of the key highlights of our fourth quarter. We exceeded the high end of our guidance with sales volumes of 9307 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 86 was oil. Contributing to our production outperformance was a continuation of our highly successful workover and reactivation efforts. We also performed 8 CTRs in the fourth quarter including 4 in the Northwest Shelf and 4 in the Central Basin Platform. Our ongoing CTR program converts wells from electrical submersible pumps to rod pumps which reduces future overall operating costs and lessens costly workovers.,REI,0.999771773815155,0.999543547358243,Positive
During the fourth quarter we generated 25 million of adjusted EBITDA that contributed 13 million of free cash flow during the period marking our fifth consecutive quarter of free cash flow. We utilized our free cash flow and the cash on hand to pay down 47 million of bank debt and ended the period with 41 million of liquidity increasing our liquidity by more than 25 than what we had at the end of the third quarter.,REI,0.8220851421356201,0.6441700721800758,Positive
Finally with the funds from equity rays and supported by rising oil price environment in early December we initiated a targeted Northwest Shelf drilling program that focuses on our highest rate of return inventory. All 4 of the wells drilled in our winter drilling campaign have been completed and are on production. As we noted in our release the first well we drilled the Badger 709 B 6XH is currently producing over 400 barrels of oil a day and is still cleaning up. We are pleased to see initial production results from these 4 wells have exceeded our expectations.,REI,0.9992142915725708,0.9984285822085035,Positive
Now lets take a look at the full year 2020. Our average sales were 8790 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 87 was oil. We performed 29 CTRs including 17 in the Northwest Shelf and 12 in the Central Basin Platform. Our continuing targeted CTR workover and reactivation programs combined with our ongoing cost optimization initiatives contributed to a lifting cost of 10.52 per BOE an 8 decrease yearoveryear. We generated 86 million of adjusted EBITDA that contributed to 40 million of free cash flow which we used to help pay down 75 million of bank debt during 2020.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to our yearend 2020 reserves and based on SEC reserve prices  yes SEC average prices of 36.04 per BOE or barrels of oil and 1.99 per MMBtu of natural gas we reported yearend 2020 proved reserves of 76.5 million barrels of oil equivalent which was down modestly from our 81.1 million barrels of oil equivalent we had at the yearend 2019. For comparison SEC average prices in 2019 were 52.19 per barrel of crude oil and,REI,0.0384150147438049,-0.9231711168117028,Negative
2.58 per MMBtu of natural gas.,REI,0.7709658145904541,0.5419313561507202,Positive
During 2020 we recorded net upward revisions of 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent primarily related to additions improved well performance and technical revisions that were offset by reductions of 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent due to lower commodity prices and 3.2 million barrels of oil equivalent of production. Our SEC proved reserves were comprised of 87 crude oil and 13 natural gas with 57.5 of total proved reserves classified as proved developed and the remaining 42.5 as proved undeveloped. Our reserve life ratio based on yearend 2020 SEC proved reserves and 2020 production was 23.8 years. The PV10 of our yearend 2020 SEC proved reserves taken from our standard measure of future cash flows was 556 million which was down 40 from the 923 million at the end of 2019 primarily due to lower prices.,REI,0.0007710754871368,-0.9984590402001383,Negative
With these operational financial results we are carrying forward a strong momentum into 2021 where we believe we will have even a better year.,REI,0.861388623714447,0.7227770821911585,Positive

Thank you Paul. It was discovered after our 10K was published yesterday that a typo occurred in the conversion of our 10K for filing. The typo is that the earnings or loss per share for 2020 was presented without the parentheses denoting it as a loss.

For the fourth quarter of 2020 we generated revenues of 31.4 million and recorded a net loss of 160.3 million or a 1.83 loss per diluted share. Included in the loss were pretax items including 129.6 million for a ceiling test impairment due to the reduction in the value of reserves from lower oil and gas pricing 15.2 million for unrealized losses on hedges as a result of the changes in oil price and 2.8 million for sharebased compensation expense. Without these items after the effect of income taxes on the adjusted items and adjusting for a valuation allowance of 50.6 million our net income would have been approximately 6.5 million or a 0.07 gain per diluted share.,REI,0.0034994781017303,-0.9930022317184399,Negative
For the full year 2020 we generated revenues of 113 million and reported a net loss of 253.4 million or a loss per diluted share of 3.48. Included in the loss were pretax items including 277.5 million for ceiling test impairment 5.4 million for sharebased compensation expense and 1.2 million for unrealized losses on hedges as a result of the changes in oil price. Without these items after the effect of income taxes on the adjusted items and adjusting for the 50.6 million valuation allowance our net income would have been approximately 20.7 million or a gain of 0.28 per diluted share.,REI,0.002197653055191,-0.9956058833634159,Negative
During the fourth quarter of 2020 we had 20.5 million in cash flow from operations and 7.8 million in capital expenditures for postCapEx positive cash flow or free cash flow of 12.7 million. For the full year 2020 we had 69.7 million in cash flow from operations 30 million in capital expenditures which resulted in free cash flow of 39.7 million.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the 3 months ended December 31 2020 we had oil sales of 734548 barrels and gas sales of 730337 Mcf for a total of 856271 BOE. Our received prices were 40.48 per barrel of oil 2.21 per Mcf of gas for an average of 36.61 per BOE. The differential between our oil price received and a weighted average NYMEX WTI averaged approximately 2 per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year 2020 we had oil sales of 2801528 barrels and gas sales of 2494502 Mcf for a total of 3217278 BOE. Our received prices were 38.95 per barrel of oil 1.57 per Mcf of gas for an average of 35.13 per BOE. The differential between our oil price received and a weighted average NYMEX WTI averaged approximately 2 per barrel for the  yes per barrel for the full year 2020.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For detailed discussions of our various income statement line items please refer to our earnings release and 10K that was filed yesterday. Im happy to answer any questions on them during our QA. As Paul discussed we were pleased to generate free cash flow once again during the fourth quarter of 2020 our fifth consecutive quarterly period. During 2020 we paid down 75 million on our credit facility and we will continue to use much of our free cash flow for that purpose. Paul will discuss in more detail in his closing comments but with the recently initiated targeted drilling program we are in a stronger position to pay down debt even faster given the high rates of return afforded by our deep inventory of drilling prospects. As we previously announced in December we completed our fall bank redetermination and our borrowing base was set at 350 million. As of December 31 we had 313 million drawn on our credit facility which resulted in liquidity of 40.6 million including 37 million available on the revolver and 3.6 million of cash and cash equivalents.,REI,0.999975860118866,0.999951720208955,Positive
Finally we are affirming the full year 2021 outlook we provided on February 22 including yearoveryear average sales growth between 2 and 8 which equates to 9000 to 9500 BOE per day with approximately 85 to 87 oil. For full year 2021 we anticipate an average  sorry yes 2021 we anticipate an average lifting cost of 0.10 to 10.50 per BOE which reflects a decrease compared to full year 2020 lifting cost of 10.52 per BOE.,REI,0.0054238438606262,-0.9891534979066241,Negative
Turning to our 2021 capital investment program we plan to drill 6 to 8 wells and complete 8 to 10 wells during the full year 2021. We are targeting total capital spending of 44 million to 48 million with all expenditures to be funded by cash on hand and cash from operations. In addition to companydirected drilling and completion activities our capital spending outlook includes targeted well reactivations workovers infrastructure upgrades and continuing our successful CTR program in the Northwest Shelf and Central Basin Platform areas. Also included is anticipated spending for leasing contractual drilling obligations and nonoperated drilling completion and capital workovers.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our 2021 capital program has been designed to sustain or minimally grow our production and reserve levels and have returns sufficient to generate free cash flow to further reduce debt. Our existing commodity hedges were implemented when prices were lower last year to ensure the necessary cash flow to adhere to these plans.,REI,0.8235992789268494,0.6471983475675271,Positive
So with that I will turn it back to Paul.,REI,0.162603497505188,-0.6747940032446405,Negative
Thank you Randy. On our third quarter earnings call I discussed in detail Rings competitive strengths as well as the challenges we face and how we were addressing them. A lot has changed over the past 4 months since we last spoke mostly for the better. However I want to talk a little about the severe winter storm that affected most of the energy industry here in Texas and more specifically how it affected our production.,REI,0.8020554780960083,0.6041107202236178,Positive
We incurred a considerable hit on our production in February down more than 60 for the majority of the storm. We had an unusual amount of downtime that took us 2 weeks or more to restore. Our first quarter production will be less than what we were originally predicting as a result of this downtime. However we have restored our production and with the performance of our new wells and the continued improvements we are seeing in our other initiatives we will still generate free cash flow for a sixth straight quarter we will still pay down debt and we are not going to change our full year guidance.,REI,0.0066549777984619,-0.9866912285633258,Negative
The next thing I want to discuss is our new strategic vision. We are committed to key principles that we are squarely focused on ensuring health safety and environmental excellence and a strong commitment to our employees and the communities in which we work and operate continuing to generate free cash flow to improve and build a sustainable financial foundation pursuing rigorous capital discipline focused on our highestreturning opportunities improving margins and driving value by continuously targeting additional operating cost reductions and capital efficiencies and strengthening our balance sheet by steadily paying down debt divesting of noncore assets and becoming a peer leader in debttoEBITDA metrics. These key principles will continue to guide us and we are committed to them by pursuing the following 5 strategic objectives first we will attract and retain the best people knowing that our future success can only be achieved through our employees. Second we will pursue operational excellence with a sense of urgency. This objective is a foundation that will define our culture and future success.,REI,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
So what does that mean exactly We will execute our operations in a safe and environmentally responsible manner apply advanced technologies and continuously seek ways to reduce our operating cash cost on a perbarrel basis. We plan to deliver lowcost consistent and efficient execution of our drilling campaigns our work programs and other operations all with a high sense of urgency.,REI,0.9108399152755736,0.8216797242639804,Positive
An example of this is our highly successful CTR program which reduces operating expenses and lessens costly workovers. The impact from this program can be seen in the decrease in our lifting cost per BOE from 11.42 in 2019 to 10.52 in 2020. Our confidence in this aspect of our culture is reflected in our forecast of continuing to lower cost this year from anywhere from 0.10 to 10.50 per BOE.,REI,0.0323323607444763,-0.935336432061453,Negative
And yet another example is we relocated our headquarters to the Woodlands and downsized the Midland office closed our Andrews field office are in the process of closing the Tulsa office reducing leasing expenses and resulting in meaningful annual cost savings. But the biggest impact of this change is not the cost savings it is the consolidation of the executive and management teams allowing for improved communication strategizing execution and continuing to build our culture.,REI,0.0104139447212219,-0.9791732902367654,Negative
Moving on to the third strategic objective is to prioritize our work programs and invest in only the highest riskadjusted rate of return projects in our inventory. This will allow us to profitably grow our production and reserve levels and generate the excess free cash flow we need to pay down debt. We have already discussed our CTR program and our Northwest Shelf drilling program but both of these demonstrate our commitment to generate as much free cash flow as we can from every dollar we spend. As you know we drilled 4 Northwest Shelf San Andres horizontal oil wells in December and January including 3 1.5mile horizontal wells and 1 1mile horizontal well. All wells are now completed and producing at various stages of cleanup. Early production results have been at or above expectations and we look forward to completing the full program over the next few months.,REI,0.999335527420044,0.9986710540479744,Positive
Moving on to the fourth strategic objective which is the  which is to focus on generating free cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt. We intend to do this through the use of excess cash from operations and potentially through the proceeds from the sale of noncore assets. Last month we announced our plan to launch a sales process to divest of our Delaware Basin assets during the second quarter of this year we are still committed to that plan. Remaining focused and disciplined in this regard will lead to meaningful returns for our shareholders and also provides additional financial flexibility to manage commodity price cycles in the future.,REI,0.9999285936355592,0.9998571871859954,Positive
And moving on to our fifth and final strategic objective is to pursue strategic acquisitions that maintain or reduce our breakeven cost. We will focus on accretive acquisitions mergers and dispositions that not only improve our breakeven cost but improve our margins lower our operating costs and are accretive on a cash flow basis. Our financial strategies associated with these efforts will focus on delivering competitive risk and debtadjusted per share returns for our shareholders.,REI,0.9673224687576294,0.9346448985605826,Positive
I want to end my prepared comments by once again thanking the entire team of Ring employees for their continued hard work and dedication. The past year has clearly been the most challenging in modern times on a global scale and especially for the oil and gas industry. While I have only been in the company for a little over 5 months I have quickly come to appreciate the collective determination and dedication of Rings employees at all levels of the organization. As important I appreciate the way they have so quickly embraced our new strategic vision which is evident in our operational and financial results as a direct result of their actions. I look forward to continuing to work closely with our team as we strive to take the company to new heights and further increase shareholder value.,REI,0.9999338388442992,0.9998676776097282,Positive
And so with that I would like to turn it over to our operator to moderate the QA session of this call.,REI,0.2253528237342834,-0.5492952759833789,Negative
QuestionandAnswer Session,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions And the first question will come from Jeffrey Campbell with Alliance Global Partners.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
My first question is regarding the Delaware Basin asset sale. I was wondering if you see 2021 as a more supportive sales environment than last year generally and if anything might be different in how the sale is conducted or valued this year.,REI,0.9589552879333496,0.9179105269375605,Positive
Yes. Good question. Yes 2021 is a better year. If you recall we entered the pandemic  we actually signed a purchase and sale agreement in April of 2020 which probably was right in that peak of the downturn. And so yes we believe that the prices are better this year. We have also made investments out there to stabilize production and also weve done a better job of looking at and actually separating out our facilities that are associated with our production and in those portions of our facilities that could be used for commercial saltwater disposal. And so we think that we can get really good value for our assets and so were looking forward to doing so this year.,REI,0.9998897910118104,0.9997795818922415,Positive
Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And digging into the MA a little bit without asking for any secret sauce so wondered if you could give us some broad gating items with regard to MA both on the sort of assets that you desire and any financing variables.,REI,0.9993919134140016,0.998783826103107,Positive
Yes. Very good. Ill address the financing first because thats the obvious thing. Yes weve got a challenging balance sheet okay And so with the debt load that we have we would like to use equity where we can. We would like to emerge from any kind of a transaction with  making further progress. Were strengthen our balance sheet and we think that we can do that. We believe now that prices have come back up to a more reasonable level there are more sellers out there if you want to call them that. There are more sellers willing to sell at these prices whereas at the  if you look back at  in November December of last year when prices were still pretty low really nobody wanted to sell their assets at 40 oil.,REI,0.8635928630828857,0.7271855635556956,Positive
Now getting back to the portion of your question associated with what type of assets well we really like the area that were in. We really like the economics of the projects that we have in our own inventory. And so yes ideally we would like to spread our very effective operating team over more wells and more barrels of production in the areas that we operate. So the synergies is an obvious thing. And so  however Im not going to tell you that we would only buy assets in and around where we currently operate. But I will say that if we do venture outside of the Central Basin platform the Southern Shelf itll be because the attributes of the acquisition bring with them similar attributes of shallow declines high margins undeveloped opportunity have low breakeven costs and short payouts and that type of thing. And probably primarily oil as well.,REI,0.996688723564148,0.9933774431809443,Positive
And the next question comes from Dun McIntosh with Johnson Rice.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Appreciate the color on the winter storm. So I was wondering if we could dig in a little more kind of on the 21 program and how you kind of see that playing out. Whats the 10 to 12 completions and the timing of those over the course of the year And I would assume that the 4 wells drilled in January  or December and January thats baked into this 10 to 12. Is that right,REI,0.9929467439651488,0.9858934795221561,Positive
That is correct. Yes 2 wells were drilled in December and  but they were completed in 2021.,REI,0.9864236116409302,0.9728472070975347,Positive
Okay. And then over the remainder of the year so I guess that leaves about call it 6 to 8 or so for the remainder of the year. Should that be pretty weighted kind of second third fourth quarter Or is  or should you kind of knock those out and then reevaluate the program as you get towards the end of the year,REI,0.852888822555542,0.7057774697407899,Positive
Well were being forced to kind of reevaluate things on a daily basis with the product prices being what they are at higher levels today than anybody was predicting just a couple of months ago. We were originally thinking that we were going to pick up a drilling rig to start our next campaign sometime in the summer. But because of the prices being what they are were actually thinking about accelerating our drilling program a little bit. So dont be surprised if we start drilling in the second quarter.,REI,0.9892466068267822,0.9784932008345133,Positive
Okay. And then I guess just to clarify and then Ill listen but when you talked about adding that second rig in the summer would that be included in the 40 million to 48 million of CapEx that youre talking about for the year,REI,0.9118215441703796,0.8236429832237859,Positive
Yes it would.,REI,0.8901186585426331,0.7802371860964215,Positive
And the next question will come from Noel Parks with Touhy Brothers.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Just a couple of things. The well that you gave results for in the release the Badger 709 B 6XH was that one of the 1.5 miles length laterals Or is that one of the regular length laterals,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Its a 1.5 miles lateral.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. Great. And for the  a couple of years into the Eastern Shelf acquisition and everything. Im just curious whats sort of the longest production history you have now at this Eastern Shelf not the Northwest Shelf Longest production history you have with the wells there so far And just how much does the  would the lateral length help the economics of the well I think the curves youve had in past presentations have been out of a 1mile lateral assumption.,REI,0.0322625041007995,-0.9354761454320822,Negative
You want to take that Alex This is Alex Dyes our Executive Vice President of Engineering and Corporate strategy.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure. So in our presentation before the  its just normalized to a 1mile lateral. So you would just move it  multiply it up to get to the 1.5 miles. And what was the first part of that question I didnt quite catch that.,REI,0.8456313014030457,0.6912624187841527,Positive
Just asking about production history now and just where  maybe where your type curves might be headed,REI,0.8470292687416077,0.6940583551277846,Positive
Sure. So a lot of the first production history I mean the original operator there drilled wells in 2016 and other operators within the area had started drilling in 15 so theres quite a bit of production history for those wells. And as far as the 1.5miles well its beneficial to get an extra 0.5 mile because you already have the location set up and you get that extra completion from that. So maybe Marinos you want to elaborate a little bit more,REI,0.9997071027755736,0.9994142052019863,Positive
Yes. The incremental cost of the 1.5miles lateral are 25 compared to the 1mile lateral. So with that and the increased EUR that we get its beneficial to drill the 1.5miles laterals when we can.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Based on all of my observations the 1.5miles wells have demonstrated not only with this team but also with some of the other operators in the area to be beneficial. So everybody tries to  as long as they have the equity position to drill the 1.5 miles its been beneficial. So you see it not so much as in IPs but you do see it considerably in terms of the EURs and the ultimate economics of the wells.,REI,0.835305392742157,0.6706105891529257,Positive
Operator Instructions The next question will be from Richard Tullis with Capital One.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Just one quick question Paul for clarification. So youre not currently running a rig but would possibly pick one up in the second quarter to continue with the drilling program and then drop that rig depending on pricing after you get to the 6 to 8 wells for the year and then consider what you would do for the rest of the year. Is that the proper way to look at it,REI,0.9988346099853516,0.9976692185814491,Positive
That is the proper way to look at it.,REI,0.932154417037964,0.8643087531976423,Positive
And the next question will come from Michael Bloomfield Private Investor.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
A question on the focus on the balance sheet and the debt reduction and I understand the sensitivity of that and am all for it. From the standpoint of an internal target that youre saying to yourself I need to get down to this level to be comfortable where the usage of cash flow going forward from that level is to maximize growth once you reach that balance in the balance sheet that gives you great comfort. Just curious if youve identified that number.,REI,0.9773243069648744,0.9546485868982,Positive
Well Ive said in the past Mike that Id prefer to be at or below 1x debttoEBITDA. I will say though if prices continue to remain strong or if some of the pundits out there who have some pretty optimistic forecasts for oil prices going off in the future if we actually come close to some of those forecasts as we get to 2.5x debttoEBITDA or below Im going to be tempted to pour on the capital to take advantage of those higher prices. And I think that would be the right thing to do for our shareholders because we have the inventory to really deliver some significant growth.,REI,0.9859148263931274,0.9718296359954095,Positive
Yes. Im in total agreement with that. And one last question. When we talk about the new wells are coming on stream the easy math for people that arent in the business each new well on an annualized basis would produce between 5 million and 7 million of gross revenues. Is that a fair number,REI,0.2368194460868835,-0.5263620176088917,Negative
Id have to go back and check that number.,REI,0.7683091163635254,0.5366179565298299,Positive
So this is Alex. Yes it also depends on prices. And then your LOE in different areas have different LOEs. So its not easy  a very easy answer. So I would say wed probably take that offline.,REI,0.839102566242218,0.678204940679634,Positive
Okay. It was just a curiosity question because it appeared to be again as a nonoil guy you take so many days times barrels produced times the current market value and you kind of get to a number. And it would appear that youd be looking at 30 million or 40 million in additional revenues when you start talking about 8 wells and it was just an interesting number.,REI,0.8625942468643188,0.7251883299281179,Positive
Michael well get back with you on that.,REI,0.7571315765380859,0.5142628635542772,Positive
And the next question is a followup from Jeffrey Campbell with Alliance Global Partners.,REI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Great. Thanks for letting me back in. I was just wondering do you have a forecast for how many more of the ESPderived pump conversions are on tap for 21 And is this a fairly ratable program over the next several years,REI,0.9974284172058104,0.9948568313460535,Positive
Yes. Ill tell you what Im going to turn that question over to our Executive Vice President of Operations Marinos Baghdati.,REI,0.930824339389801,0.8616485963157394,Positive
Yes sir. We currently have 92 wells that are on ESP excluding the new wells. We anticipate based on our failure frequencies and the forecast that we have that well have 36 conversions to rod pump by the end of this year. Theres 20 to 30 wells that will  probably wont be converted to rod pump throughout their life because of their high water volumes. So after 2022 with an additional 30 to 35 rod pump conversions in 2022 well be at a point where all the wells that need to be converted to rod pump are done. And at that point itll just be the new wells that we drill once they get to that point that theyll be converted.,REI,0.986835241317749,0.9736704669418734,Positive

Before I hand over to Kin Ning please also pay attention to our disclaimer which you can find on Page 2 of the presentation. We can start now.,CKHUY,0.7686483860015869,0.5372964962103941,Positive
Okay. Good afternoon and lets turn to Page 4 of our presentation. So that this gives you a summary of our 2020 results. Revenue  now 2020 is a year plagued by COVID19 and also the more significant is oil price drop that affects Husky Oil in a material way. And so this  all these result has been taken into account of all this problem and you will see that revenue the total group dropped 8 and EBITDA dropped 13 and EBIT should drop 24.,CKHUY,0.1549808382987976,-0.6900393307443444,Negative
And our earnings minus 27. And net earning per share at 7.56 minus 27 and correspondingly EPS is minus 27.,CKHUY,0.0393405854701995,-0.9213199742555467,Negative
But however because of  we have  the operation has been operated very tight and then we have some mega transaction come through and then the debt ratio has dropped from 25 last year to 22. So that we can see that this is a very excellent result because what happened at the oil front is so difficult and the figure come through negative against us. It is so bad but thanks to the VHA deal that we merged with TPG and thanks for the tower deal. And then we actually generate enough profit to overcome the mega losses incurred by Husky Oil.,CKHUY,0.0001189410686492,-0.9997633098145188,Negative
And also during this year we also fixed Husky which we will go into more detail by merging with Cenovus as the end result is a much better animal. And if you look at the  today when we merged with  we were about 3 and then now Cenovus is over 10. And then if you go back to what we own in Husky the equipment is about 8.50. So the result of the merger gives us a lot of hope and then we are Indiscernible,CKHUY,0.9130678772926332,0.8261356509540387,Positive
If you go to Page 5 okay give you the EBITDA because Husky Oil order country and percentage changes. If you see that instead of 1 circle we now have 2 circles. One is the outer one is the actual auditors because Husky suddenly become negative. So that every other thing become bigger. And then the inner one  the outer one is the actual one then the inner one is the were set right count and if you look at the graph the chart on the righthand side you saw that  you saw the waterfall of how the EBITDA dropped.,CKHUY,0.0219457149505615,-0.9561097360311366,Negative
So we go from 2019 underlying EBITDA and then the part basically dropped 2.5 billion.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Actually its mostly came from last year as first half and the second half is structured much less and it went to the fourth quarter. Actually it is quite a good performance. And the same thing is on the retail and then the retail is also suffered by the first half when the whole business dropped 50. But then the second half was doing quite good. Actually second half was better than last year.,CKHUY,0.9702928066253662,0.9405855778369772,Positive
This is why. So the retail  so as a whole year it only dropped 1.8 billion. Its mostly come from first half.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then the interest structure doesnt really affect the  by the COVID19 so its doing  it shows a green color. And Husky is the big casualty and which we will describe to you later.,CKHUY,0.995238184928894,0.9904763641812588,Positive
And then the telephone group is basically  although it showed the HKD 3.3 billion negative is actually is doing quite good. Actually if you look at the underlying performance its similar to last year. So what happened is that this  there was a nonrecurring item or onetime item happened last year which is a 1 billion happen in Italy when we shift some compensation from some vendor and then about 1.2 billion in  from the 3 U.K. where we got some compensation  some benefit from the VAT. And then there was 1 billion from the corporate side where there some adjustment came through. Actually from the operations Indiscernible you will see later is quite stable.,CKHUY,0.9349677562713624,0.8699354350182029,Positive
And the same thing happened to Asia and then it is quite a stable operation and now. So on the head office front I would  basically the interest I will let Frank talk more to it okay So this year you will see that most of the  majority of the income come from Europe and Hong Kong become more enough because of the Husky Oil doesnt contribute anything.,CKHUY,0.9656939506530762,0.9313878604101302,Positive
So the next page Page 6. Frank on the cash flow side. Can you take over,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The first sort of easy snapshot of what the cash flow profile of the group was like. So operating cash flow is just a very quick proxy. Its EBITDA from our subsidiaries plus distributions from our associates less CapEx and investments. And so obviously on that measure we had a meaningful decline from 2019 right And you see that in the bars basically the result for this year at 39.8 billion is the  what you get by subtracting 69.6 billion  sorry 29.7 billion from 69.6 billion on the columns on the right. And the distribution of that obviously speaks pretty well for itself.,CKHUY,0.9997458457946776,0.9994916912863796,Positive
Interestingly though this rough measure tells a lot less of the story this year. So if we go very quickly to the next slide the  theres really no important number on Slide 7. Theres really no important message just to convey here except that essentially everybody is living within their means. And in fact everybody is living within CapEx and investment envelopes that are less than depreciation except right in the telecoms group and in HAT where we are still in a meaningful investment phase. But obviously the message is even on the operating free cash flow measure right were very well covered in terms of our spending profile.,CKHUY,0.9609702825546264,0.9219405185821761,Positive
The next page Page 8 is actually quite a little bit more interesting this year because it looks at the whole free cash flow picture. And when you do that you obviously have to take into account of whats happening to interest expenses and financing costs. You have to take account of whats happening in taxes. And you have to take account of whats happening in working capital. So its a slightly complex chart.,CKHUY,0.0689367055892944,-0.8621276987360112,Negative
But to simplify it if you go to the righthand side right last years free cash flow underlying free cash flow after tax after working capital movements after financing cost et cetera was 21.7 billion.,CKHUY,0.973618984222412,0.9472379369961839,Positive
Now weve just gone through the reduction in EBITDA that we suffered right during the year of 10.9 billion but we recovered significantly more than that right in terms of the believe it or not overall level of dividends that we received from our associates excluding Husky Energy of course. But interest and financing costs and taxes paid were down very significantly. So in the aggregate by HKD 6.1 billion.,CKHUY,0.146485149860382,-0.7070307177488315,Negative
And working capital was managed very very tightly all around from the group. I have to in particular single out the retail division right for their excellent job in managing working capital over the course of the year. So the swing from yeartoyear is 9 billion. So the free cash flow underlying profile for 2020 is 27.9 billion right which is fully 6 billionplus better.,CKHUY,0.7539418935775757,0.5078834938308561,Positive
And obviously I think a very encouraging picture in terms of the groups financial profile.,CKHUY,0.989466905593872,0.9789337986313094,Positive
If we go to the next page right This is this is Page 9. The groups financial profile not surprisingly after everything that Ive just said right is still very strong. Net debt as we said has reduced has reduced substantially in absolute dollars and has continued actually to  weve been continuing to reduce gross debt right in the first 2 months of this year.,CKHUY,0.0052630007266998,-0.989475184366217,Negative
Our net debt ratio is at 22.2. One of the things that works against us there is the movement in sterling and euros right over yearonyear which increases net debt. And as a result negatively affects the ratio. So you could argue that on a likeforlike basis that the ratio is a little bit better than that.,CKHUY,0.0135724544525146,-0.9728562670089407,Negative
Our ratings stayed stable. Our weighted average maturity at 4.7 years is very manageable. We are still further down in terms of the average cost of debt capital at 1.7.,CKHUY,0.9677731990814208,0.9355463597454783,Positive
Were now after swaps 31 in floating rates and 69 in fixed rates. Thats again less floating than last year. We were 33 last year and 67 fixed. So weve been taking some advantage of moving out along the curve a bit right as we medium longerterm rates obviously have been at historic lows.,CKHUY,0.0179162323474884,-0.9641687060408032,Negative
I dont really have anything to say in terms of our debt maturity profile except as I mentioned we reduced gross debt already in Q1 led by EUR 1.6 billion roughly USD 2 billion. And CKI of course will report that they redeemed the perpetual of 1.2 billion right in full right in February I believe so.,CKHUY,0.1518901288509369,-0.6962207533244809,Negative
I think thats all I have to say about the overall financial profile. And the next section is ports. So Canning,CKHUY,0.8596100807189941,0.7192199940800632,Positive
Okay. Yes. The ports this year is a difficult year in the first half because of the China shutdown and then towards the middle of the year is the European shutdown. But then it really recovered well towards the end of the year. So that is the whole story.,CKHUY,0.1546255350112915,-0.6907499377429114,Negative
So that we still  our asset is USD 11 billion and then 283 berths and 52 ports in 26 countries. And last year we handled 83.7 million TEU which is 3 below 2019.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then the EBITDA is 10 billion  almost 11 billion and 19 of 2019. And if you look at basically if you will look at the waterfall chart from 2019 to 2020 you will see that actually if you look at the first red is the main line and so basically its all come from because in the first half we reduced Shanghai by 20 so that the reduction mainly comes from the reductions of interest. Its not really from the operation.,CKHUY,0.9017760753631592,0.8035520336342059,Positive
And then if you saw a bigger figure 1.3 billion from Asia Australia and all those. One of the major big is about 600 million and then come from the close of the Dan mine and then we provide if you take the opportunity to provide some of the middle  small Middle East port. And so that there is about 600 million. And then another 200 million from  if you compare to last year demand because we finished the concession in September.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So that if you take that away the other is a small drop. So that actually it was better in the second half already. And then the corporate is at 400  almost 500 million its basically the dividend from OOCL which we had last year we dont have this year. So the ports this year have a difficult time but they hold they fought pretty well. And then about the September  August September onwards actually the throughput start coming back.,CKHUY,0.2284598350524902,-0.543081249643117,Negative
And then we still see a strong throughput growth until now this year.,CKHUY,0.7566467523574829,0.5132932146151152,Positive
If you go to Page 11 somebody move the page in the screen. And so that shows you the monthly throughput. And if you look at that the trust is all  the green is about 2019. And you can see that all for the main trust Mainland Europe and Asia Australia if you show  it shows that in Asia and then after June they are all doing quite well. And then in Mainland it is the same thing.,CKHUY,0.9976984262466432,0.9953968497495951,Positive
In Europe actually it is getting better and better in the summer. And then its getting better in the last 2 months and the same as in the other Asian and Australian ports. So that the story is that  is coming back the stories. And then we see strong performance in January and February and also March up to today right,CKHUY,0.9787929058074952,0.957585786334149,Positive
Page 12 lets go to the famous retail. I think we got Dominic here. He is not only a head office Director but he also is the CEO of Watson. So I will invite him to talk Page 12.,CKHUY,0.7926384806632996,0.5852767141322577,Positive
Okay. Well thank you Canning. And Im sure all of you will be interested and anxious to know what the retail division have  was doing last year and also into the first 2 months of this year.,CKHUY,0.988702654838562,0.9774052962096311,Positive
But before commenting on the slides that follow I would like to pass on the following messages so that to put things into the right perspective. 2020 was a testing year for all retailers in the world and A.S. Watson has proven to be resilient versus competition with total sales dropping only 5.7 versus 2019.,CKHUY,0.9868860244750975,0.9737720333171087,Positive
The first half of the year was very challenging with massive store closures especially in China. But then we have a very robust recovery in the second half both in terms of sales and profit.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
To illustrate EBITDA in the second half increased significantly by 111 when compared to the first half. And like what Canning said 12 increase over the same period second half of 2019. This was helped by large  by the large loyalty member base and an acceleration in our digital transformation. At the same time the OO strategy i.e. offline plus online has enabled us to significantly increase our digital sales by leveraging our physical store network. So the physical stores actually helped the ecommerce side. So as a result the ecommerce sales increased over 90 in 2020. And to update you on the last  in the first 2 months of this year EBITDA and EBIT has already returned to the 2019 level.,CKHUY,0.8224523067474365,0.6449044018414032,Positive
So now lets go to the slide. So this gives you an overall perspective of how the retail division was doing last year. Some corporate information on the left. The retail division is the worlds largest international health and beauty retailer operating in 27 markets with 139 loyalty members worldwide. One of the largest loyalty programs in the world.,CKHUY,0.9999661445617676,0.9999322890831763,Positive
And more importantly 65 of our total sales actually came from this member base.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our exclusive sales participation reached 35 of total sales creating a lot of uniqueness and differentiation. The business strategy for the past few years has been focusing on OO offline plus online. Its a new terminology that I want to elaborate. In fact it leverages on our extensive network and also our CRM member base. The reason for this OO strategy is quite obvious.,CKHUY,0.9994709491729736,0.9989418977152691,Positive
Because our data analysis shows that an average OO customer i.e. a customer who buys both offline and online spend 3x as much as they spend by customers who only shop in physical stores. So theres huge sales upside potential for us going forward.,CKHUY,0.0665081441402435,-0.8669848245291857,Negative
And if you want to understand more under this very important OO strategy Malina Ngai the Chief Operating Officer of Retail would be very happy to elaborate for you in the QA session.,CKHUY,0.99532550573349,0.9906510058945452,Positive
On store numbers the division has 16167 stores at yearend an increase of 2. 50 of the stores are in Asia and 50 in Europe. In terms of EBITDA despite the tough trading environment marked by store closures and reduced footfall EBITDA only dropped 15 or 16 in local currency to 14.4 billion. Moreover if you exclude a onetime dilution gain of 633 million recognized in 2019 as a result of a merger between the partnership of China and Yonghui of China the EBITDA decrease is even lower at 11.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So the underlying EBITDA decrease is only 11. But reportedly 16 in local currency.,CKHUY,0.1269074976444244,-0.7461860455191407,Negative
In terms of the split 48 of the EBITDA is in Asia and 52 in Europe. On EBITDA growth the waterfall chart on the right shows decreases in all divisions except other retail the green block which shows a 1.1 billion increase. This represents a strong performance of PARKnSHOP the supermarket chain as well as Fortress the electrical retail chain in Hong Kong and strong performance in the Watsons water and beverage division.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
On the other hand the health and beauty business had a total EBITDA decrease of 20 around 3.1 billion attributed by a decrease of 1.77 billion in health and beauty China followed by 628 million decrease in health and beauty Asia 553 million in Western Europe and 190 million in Eastern Europe.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Noteworthy is that the EBITDA decreases in health and beauty mainly took place in the first half of the year as Canning mentioned as also the Chairman mentioned when it dropped 44. But since then we saw a very strong recovery in the second half when we witnessed even a small positive growth of 0.3. So netnet the total EBITDA for the year is 14.4 billion which includes an FX translation gain of 161 million.,CKHUY,0.9948774576187134,0.9897549091308768,Positive
For EBITDA margin percentage its worth mentioning in the lower righthand table as a result of decreases in EBITDA dollar the EBITDA margin percentage of the various health and beauty divisions were also adversely affected. Health and beauty China saw a 4 percentage points drop from 18 to 14 whereas the other divisions dropped 1 percentage point. The wider margin percentage decrease in China is due to the significant drop in EBITDA as aforementioned as well as a shift in category mix.,CKHUY,0.0699768960475921,-0.8600473165794116,Negative
What I mean by category mix is that under the epidemic we saw less consumption of the highermargin skin care and cosmetic products while consumption of the lower margin personal and body care products were still in demand. So we believe this is reversible post COVID and we are seeing it happening in recent months.,CKHUY,0.0673398375511169,-0.8653214367159825,Negative
Next slide Slide 13. And in fact the next 2 slides shows the quarterly sales changes and their respective health and beauty divisions during the year. The blocks in the middle illustrate the quarterly EBITDA change yearonyear and the charts underneath simply illustrated temporary store closure profile.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
First for the health and beauty China chart on the left we can see the biggest sales decrease was in Q1 when the sales dropped 78 in February with over 2500 temporary store closures. With the closed stores gradually be opened in subsequent months we can see from the graph that the negative sales growth improved. Also worth mentioning is that the sales reduction is smaller than the stores traffic reduction which is illustrated by the red dotted line underneath the sales change graph. This was the result of increases in customer conversion rates and higher average transaction  transaction value so that the sales decrease is lower than the traffic decrease. Overall the total sales decrease for the year is 19 with first half decrease of 26 improving to 11 in the second half. So we have a tough first half but recovered nicely in the second half.,CKHUY,0.7504215240478516,0.5008427505747977,Positive
Correspondingly as shown in the red box in the middle the EBITDA dropped 62 in the first half and narrowed to only 13 in the second half with total EBITDA decrease of 39 for the year. Nonetheless the silver lining is that theres a rapid proliferation of online sales which increased 123 yearonyear. The increase in online sales was held by the milestone initiative which I mentioned last year during the internal results whereby our 28000 plus store staff remained connected with our loyalty members through the WeChat enterprise app to retain sales. So even during the close downs during the pandemic our customers are still engaged with our 28000odd store staff or sales agents and beauty advisers. So OO participation has reached at 35 China got the highest OO sales participation within the retail group.,CKHUY,0.1692158281803131,-0.661569334011873,Negative
Now next for health and beauty Asia. We see a sharp decrease of around 30 in Q2 as a result of store closures in a number of countries in April. Overall the sales decrease for the year is 16 with first half decrease of 17 improving to 14 in the second half. So on EBITDA I must point out that Hong Kong had a major adverse impact on the divisions EBITDA with a sharp decrease of indiscernible tourist arrivals due to the border closures our Hong Kong Watson stores located in tourist areas were severely impacted. But on a more positive note excluding these tourist stores the rest of the portfolio is healthy and profitable.,CKHUY,0.0557170510292053,-0.8885670236152552,Negative
And the tourist stores are being turning around with encouraging initial results that we see recently. Overall the Asia division managed to narrow its yearonyear EBITDA decline from 39 in the first half to only 3 in the second half. So on a country basis Malaysia Thailand were doing better and leading the recovery with 2020 full year sales matching that of 2019. So Malaysia Thailand these contributed to maintain the sales versus 2019. Philippines still suffer from a prolonged period of quarantine in key cities. And lastly for the health and beauty Asia division the online sales growth is 101.,CKHUY,0.001186192035675,-0.9976288066082041,Negative
So next slide Slide 14. Similar chart for Western Europe and Eastern Europe okay Now first on Western Europe. Well Western Europe is like a tale of 2 cities. In the Netherlands and Germany all of our health and beauty stores remain open during the lock down because they are deemed essential retail. Both countries Netherlands and Germany saw positive sales and positive EBITDA growth during the year because the stores are located in suburban areas and close to supermarkets where the footfalls were not much affected by COVID.,CKHUY,0.9996873736381532,0.9993747469036265,Positive
Whereas in U.K. although our health and beauty stores also remain open but they are more located in the high suites and shopping malls where footfall drops was both apparent. So as a result both sales and EBITDA in U.K. declined significantly versus 2019. However we are confident that when the lockdown measures start to ease which is now with the vaccination program the U.K. business are poised for a robust recovery this year and we are very confident of that.,CKHUY,0.9876800179481506,0.9753600212097295,Positive
So on the luxury business while the health and beauty stores were being open the perfumery the luxury business although located in the same countries for example the Netherlands the product is open but the Indiscernible luxury business has to be closed because they are deemed nonessential. So netnet with all these counterbalancing factors the total sales for the year in Western Europe only dropped 3 overall 5 in the first half and recovered strongly to only 1 in the second half.,CKHUY,0.0010443329811096,-0.9979125248864442,Negative
So likewise for EBITDA we see a very strong recovery in the second half by turning around a yearonyear reduction of 39 in the first half to a growth of 14 in the second half. So as a result total EBITDA decrease for the year is only 9. And online sales for this division has recorded a healthy 70 growth yearonyear.,CKHUY,0.8037511110305786,0.6075019881141115,Positive
So last we turn to the Eastern Europe chart. So overall the total sales of Eastern Europe remained flat at the same level as 2019. With 2 drop in the first half and compensated by 2 growth in the second half. So 2 drop first half 2 increase in second half. And the sales and EBITDA profile of Eastern Europe actually is dominated by Poland where they had a 24 EBITDA drop in the first half but a robust recovery to positive EBITDA growth of 3 in the second half.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So total EBITDA decrease for this division is limited to only 9. So online sales growth for the division is also very good at 108.,CKHUY,0.1893385052680969,-0.6213239558481907,Negative
So in summary we have looked at various divisions Asia China Western Europe Eastern Europe. But overall the retail division has shown a high degree of resilience attributed to its well balanced and welldiversified portfolio and the online capability actually have benefited and quickly improved during the pandemic year in support of our successful OO strategy. So this is a very quick summary of retail happening last year. And I now pass back to Canning on the infrastructure.,CKHUY,0.9374001026153564,0.8748001306057755,Positive
Yes. I dont think we need to dwell on it. Im sure CKI will have reported in detail what the drivers were right of its earnings reduction in 2020. A couple of anomalies. One is some meaningful COVID events effects somewhere in the area of HKD 600 million from assets like PARKnFLY in Canada where obviously nobody was flying and therefore nobody was parking.,CKHUY,0.9538038969039916,0.907607738737904,Positive
In addition there was a very major accounting volatility relating to deferred taxes right which resulted in a charge of HKD 1.4 billion because of a 2 increase in the tax rate in the U.K. that was announced during the course of 2020. Thats quite problematic right because its not a real cash volatility or even a real cash flow risk.,CKHUY,0.0002754032611846,-0.9994503852429304,Negative
Most of the regulated assets have in effect a passthrough of the actual cash tax burden that is paid out in any given year by the regulated utilities. So this anomaly of course grows larger with the increase in 2021 with the proposed increase in tax rates that were expecting somewhere in the U.K. which would go up by 6 and its something that well be looking very closely at because its becoming a very distorting earnings volatility with no real meaning in cash terms.,CKHUY,0.0096842944622039,-0.9806325916246127,Negative
Other than that there are some headwinds in the business in terms of regulatory resets. We all know that. Regulatory resets are tending in one direction which is not that surprising given how far longterm interest rates have dropped all around the world. The timetable on the lower right sort of sets out what is to be reset during which periods and it will be what it will be. Needless to say in value terms at the same low interest rate environment thats driving the regulatory reset environment is probably also supportive of the valuation environment for infrastructure assets.,CKHUY,0.9801458120346068,0.960291600401163,Positive
So well have to see where all those puts and takes take you.,CKHUY,0.9798134565353394,0.9596268890064292,Positive
If I can move on. Canning do you want to talk about Husky Or do you want me to do that,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Why dont you do it,CKHUY,0.247132122516632,-0.505736652455719,Negative
Thank you. Okay. So Slide 16 Im not going to dwell on the Husky debacle. I mean what happens when all of the commodity price supporting your production goes through the floor and goes way below your cash breakeven level let alone your earnings breakeven level and you combine that with effectively a collapse in the markets for refined products largely due to the collapse in demand for jet fuel. And you have an unprecedented Armageddon and you get the kind of net loss profile which is shown on this slide which wax CKHH whichever line you choose to look at was an unprecedented loss.,CKHUY,0.9927771091461182,0.9855542096818743,Positive
Now interestingly it is a noncash loss in the sense that Husky only paid us a relatively small dividend. So in terms of this impact on our cash and our financial profile relatively low but it is indicative of a pretty significant value loss in Husky and you cant ignore that.,CKHUY,0.0302839875221252,-0.9394331809480078,Negative
Of course we were fortunate and that we were able to agree and then in early January complete a merger with Cenovus Energy. That merger weve already talked about a little bit but it creates not only one of the largest number 3 producer in Canada but also one of the lowestcost producers and one of the most integrated producers in North America which is a superb place to be. What that translates into is a WTI breakeven which is very significantly below where Husky is WTI breakeven might ever have been considered to be.,CKHUY,0.9999592900276184,0.9999185800067067,Positive
And as a result of that in the current commodity price environment which let us hope that it persists during the course of the year we are probably experiencing netbacks that are more than double than what they would otherwise have been so in last years price environment. So the good news there is that in terms of value creation Cenovus is a company that does not need to incur exploration expenses in order to support its production profile and its reserve profile and a reasonable level of growth in its production. That being the case most of the kind of cash flow thats being generated in this environment can go to debt reduction as can the realization of synergies which have been targeted at a run rate in cash terms of CAD 1.2 billion a year as an exit rate coming out of this year. So you can see that that potentially adds to the value of the equity position that we have very materially.,CKHUY,0.99987530708313,0.9997506140176144,Positive
Just to go over that very quickly. We actually hold a number of warrants in addition to our shares. So on a fully diluted basis our interest is 16.79. The warrants are at 6.50 strike price they have a 5year term. So they are very valuable little pieces of paper right now. Canning mentioned that weve experienced a terrific recovery in value already. So for our 16.79 thats a CAD 3.5 billion gain from the Husky low point which was at around 3 a share. So it is  as mergers go so far were very happy because its almost a 3x here.,CKHUY,0.9989264011383056,0.9978528009967809,Positive
So I think Ill stop there and hand back to Canning for telecoms.,CKHUY,0.1140091717243194,-0.7719827127353626,Negative
Okay. So much for Husky. And I think the combined animal is a much better animal than Husky standalone. Similar production of oil quantities but at a much higher quality and much lower cost. So that I think we should be able to take advantage of this situation.,CKHUY,0.9596452713012696,0.9192904944959253,Positive
Now lets go to Page 17 on telecommunications. So that the way  so that this company had total revenue of 85 billion revenue but then it dropped about 3 in local currency. And of course during the COVID period which is couple most of the time a lot of the time in Europe in various times. And the gross add is  has dropped. But however the trend is also doing good.,CKHUY,0.1969399750232696,-0.6061210072761818,Negative
And then of course the one thing that we miss out is a reduction in the roaming income okay So that our customer base is 38.5 million so down 5 and our  but then our ARPU is getting better because people stay home and I suppose they have nothing to do and then they spend more time on the phone. And of course you can see the usage is 35 more.,CKHUY,0.1462610363960266,-0.7074789449447065,Negative
And then during last year we actually do a lot of things on 5G. And you just be indiscernible of the 5G capability we start rolling out everywhere. And then as the Chairman pointed out in the press conference actually we just got hold of 2 10 megahertz of  of 700 at a price which is almost 50 of what we paid for the last time around which is very good. And in fact I just want to say that its the first time in our career our U.K. spectrum position is more than competitive than the others. Our 5G 3.5 5 is much more than our competitor. And then the first time that we have 10 megahertz of lower spectrum at 700 which is very very good to us.,CKHUY,0.9957910776138306,0.9915821502102318,Positive
So if you look at the righthand side the middle of the slide and then you see the waterfall chart. And I think basically its just summarize what I said take away the oneoff or nonrecurring one actually the business is similar to last year. So this group holding very well. And then actually the slight red in U.K. you can just say that is because of the cost in holding the 5G spectrum. And we have to pay a spectrum fee and this amount was more than what we did last year.,CKHUY,0.9963204860687256,0.9926409677511261,Positive
And if you  so EBITDA margin is more  U.K. is always still in a work in progress but has improving. And then the margin other than U.K. is more almost dropped. Its quite good Italy 46 Sweden 47 Austria 51 even Ireland 43. So the 2 need to improve Denmark and U.K. On Page 18 you saw the details.,CKHUY,0.8662763833999634,0.7325526073888584,Positive
And I just want to draw you the line is EBITDA less CapEx 11 billion for the 3 U.K. group which is quite good. And then CapEx is a little bit higher at 20 billion. The depreciation just for equipment alone you saw the 15 billion which is used in both CAC and spectrum.,CKHUY,0.912851095199585,0.8257020865095177,Positive
But if you just take those 2 out its about 12 billion so that our CapEx is still higher at 20 billion and higher than the 12 billion were right in the spend. And this is a continuous work that we need to improve. But however because this is to build out 5G and actually we do have business trend so that when we do build they should be able to sell it. So to generate income. Hopefully that will be a key component for the business for the next 2 years.,CKHUY,0.985598087310791,0.971196157453154,Positive
Okay. And then coming to 19. I think Frank spent a lot of time on this. Maybe I will let him describe it on Page 19.,CKHUY,0.8948158025741577,0.7896314797589061,Positive
Yes. And I think the story on our tower sales is well known. So I just want to make clear that  so that everybody understands what we received in 2020 and booked was proceeds of HKD 20.8 billion. And what we recorded is a gain of HKD 16.6 billion in the year. The remainder of the aggregate 10 billion of consideration comes in this year in 2021. Thats already started with the completion of the sale in Sweden in January. But of course the 2 biggest sales remain to be completed. Thats the towers in Italy and the tower assets in the U.K. including the lions share of the buildtosuit program which falls in the U.K. That we anticipate will bring in additional proceeds of 73.1 billion and an additional gain in 2021 of 50.8 billion.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So we dont at this point anticipate any major issues impacting closing either in the  in Italy or in the U.K. and we are in the relatively routine regulatory processes in respect of both of those closings as we speak and we will update as developments occur.,CKHUY,0.754487156867981,0.5089740210616713,Positive
What do we do with the cash flow Obviously what we did with the cash was what you do in relatively dark and uncertain times. We first reduced gross debt. We  I said in the original announcement last November that we would be considering market share buyback programs and that remains the case when these proceeds come in I think its quite possible that we will be in execution mode. But again as we said in the announcement always subject to a full evaluation of the companys position and the markets position and the world as we see it at the time.,CKHUY,0.9653403759002686,0.9306807104830208,Positive
So I think that pretty well summarizes the tower picture and well take questions later if there are any.,CKHUY,0.9591328501701356,0.9182656516228032,Positive
Okay. And then I just want to  just to emphasize on this transaction is very convenient for us both the VHA and this one because of the big loss weve incurred in Husky and this one actually help us to overcome the losses that we did suffer from the indiscernible loss that we suffered from Husky. And go to Page 20. HAT is nothing much to talk about. The Indonesian business I think that the exciting thing is not the result.,CKHUY,0.0017659068107604,-0.996469376366959,Negative
The exciting thing is that we are able to come to a preliminary agreement with Indosat so that we merge the 2 companies and everything is in progress and then the 2 parties are working up nicely. Hopefully we can have something to sign and then theres a goodwill on 2 parties.,CKHUY,0.8564415574073792,0.7128829436796569,Positive
And then if you look at the red color in Indonesia its basically its not from the operation. There was an exchange gain that they booked last year. And which is not occurring this year. Other than that they have increased margin by 7 but also because of they have a bigger network. So we also increased cost by 7. So the operation is similar to the year before.,CKHUY,0.0381331145763397,-0.9237349174826845,Negative
And Vietnam I think I want to mention a special mention because we are a small player in a difficult market. We have a small team and I just want to mention that the new CEO the female CEO that we have founded has been doing extremely well. And its such a difficult situation with COVID19 and she managed to breakeven. And I think we had also that we are not losing any EBITDA there.,CKHUY,0.9997154474258424,0.9994308945124715,Positive
So  all right. And so I just want to mention it so that she can hear this. As you know that Im not critical of her. All right. Next page ESG.,CKHUY,0.985248327255249,0.9704966369251233,Positive
Frank are you going to do it this one,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure. Sure. Look theres so much that we could say about the developments around ESG all around the CK Hutchison Group. I think Ill leave it for the most part to QA at this stage because it would extend the presentation time for longer than we should. Probably the most important thing is not walking the walk or talking the talk is what you actually achieve.,CKHUY,0.999438464641571,0.9988769286137393,Positive
And theres never been a challenge like COVID19 and Im actually very proud of the way our group made our way through it.,CKHUY,0.9537358283996582,0.9074716016480933,Positive
If you look at our employees we had case loads hospital admissions morbidity way below the national averages in all of the countries that we operate in. I can tell you that as of last night we had 373 active cases mainly in Europe. And sadly weve lost 14 colleagues. But that is against the workforce of over 300000 which is I think just an absolutely first rate testament to having handled the protection of our employees well. We did a lot which you can see on the next slide in terms of protecting our customers and the communities that we operate in.,CKHUY,0.9407306909561156,0.8814613112576668,Positive
And I think thats the final slide Slide 24. This is the stuff that ESG is really about. Its what you really do when the rubber hits the road. And I think we showed ourselves very very proud in 2020.,CKHUY,0.9971789121627808,0.9943578209625608,Positive
And with that we can move to QA.,CKHUY,0.8586852550506592,0.7173703416409145,Positive

A  Hans Leung,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions Okay. The first question is about the  is a general question about the company. What is the priority of the companys capital allocation,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I think our priorities would be opening some new retail stores stores that have a quick payback. And the other one would be we will engage inmarket consolidation within the telecom market. And activities which are earnings and cash flow accretive. So we will do those. Also part of the capital will be allocated to some share buyback.,CKHUY,0.967681646347046,0.9353632541675894,Positive
So  but this will  the timing would have to depend on the closing of the tower deals. Since were talking about tower deals there some markets misunderstanding that some people thought that we will be taking the profit of the hotel deal in 2020. Id say were taking a rather conservative view and that is  we took the profit on those portions that have been closed in 2020. And a big portion of them will be taken in 2021. I think I might as well use this opportunity to clarify that misunderstanding.,CKHUY,0.99079692363739,0.9815938363038517,Positive
Somehow it keeps creeping up in various reports  hotel reports.,CKHUY,0.0325396060943603,-0.9349219411146291,Negative
The second question the groups 2020 cash flow profile was very strong with underlying yearonyear growth of 29 in free cash flow. Any comment on the groups cashgenerating capability in 2021 when CapEx starts to be normalized,CKHUY,0.2285435795783996,-0.5429137604914669,Negative
Well we always take quite a conservative approach to CapEx spending and working capital. And I look forward to another year of strong cash flow. I mean cash flow is a Indiscernible,CKHUY,0.9952288866043092,0.9904577675210047,Positive
Absolutely.,CKHUY,0.7864245176315308,0.5728487806610947,Positive
Okay. The next question is what is the companys target gearing ratio,CKHUY,0.7318555116653442,0.46371070367735845,Positive
I dont think we have a target simple gearing ratio. I think we should  our objective is to make sure that we have our credit rating. I think  again I use this opportunity to go back to the earlier question about cash flow. Sometimes in the new accounting rules now cash flow in a way reflects the companys operation strength or health sometimes more so than the simple earnings.,CKHUY,0.967670440673828,0.9353408428077952,Positive
I use one example one subsidiary of Hutch CKI. This year the cash flow is stronger than the previous year. But because of the impairment of deferred tax charges earnings is down. But if you look closely at the regulated business the rules of the regulation allow the operator to collect the increase  the difference in the increase in tax in future years. So actually theres no destruction of value when the tax rate goes up but because we abide by accounting rule we will have to take a hit now but we have a higher reported profit in later years which is confusing to some people but the accounting rule is that way.,CKHUY,0.001495361328125,-0.9970104676547453,Negative
So sometimes I use the cash flow as a better indicator of the operations  health and operating environment.,CKHUY,0.9531196355819702,0.9062392152781578,Positive
Thank you. The next question is about our cost division. Do you expect the improvement in Ports throughput will be continued in 2021,CKHUY,0.9752724170684814,0.9505448046593694,Positive
Well maybe Canning you can answer that question. But all I know is that the first 2 ones look extremely good.,CKHUY,0.9990916848182678,0.9981833685537389,Positive
I think the outlook is for us is positive. And the ports are very busy in China very busy from China go to Europe. So that the first two months we are happy.,CKHUY,0.7994161248207092,0.5988320105266633,Positive
The next question is about the retail division. What is the progress of the OO strategy,CKHUY,0.9016363620758056,0.8032726068929472,Positive
Well the OO is a success story. 2 things. One it shows the return and it shows the resilience of the group in a big crisis in 2020. It has achieved good results. And I want  I mean this is Dominic Lais Im not going to discuss further.,CKHUY,0.9976097345352172,0.9952194662210141,Positive
I should let him answer the question.,CKHUY,0.8430494070053101,0.6860986269108218,Positive
Okay. Well in fact the OO is exactly what the customer wants because the customer is now moving say online offline and then we can serve them equally well. And the numbers shows that they spend 3x more than a single channel customer. So why dont I pass this maybe on this OO I will ask Melina to shed some light on this strategy. This is a very important strategy for the retail group.,CKHUY,0.9804808497428894,0.9609616762171247,Positive
Okay. Thank you Dominic. Well the progress of the OO strategy has actually accelerated ahead of our expectation in 2020. And well first and foremost OO is about getting our customer to shop with us both offline and online. So unlike some of the retailers we have whats driving offline to online or vice versa our OO strategy is about not having any cannibalization.,CKHUY,0.9987525939941406,0.9975051865012565,Positive
The customer who shops with us on both offline and online theyre spending currently at the analytics shows us that its going to be  is 3x higher than the customers who shop with us only in the store.,CKHUY,0.0124780237674713,-0.9750451296836911,Negative
So meaning that if I used to spend 1000 with A.S. Watson 1000 by shopping in the store. And once I get to shop online as well then my spending every year becomes 3000. So this is the 3x spending potential that we are seeing in our OO strategy.,CKHUY,0.9901369214057922,0.9802738310538714,Positive
So the progress of OO happened in 2020. And first of all more customers actually shopped with us on estore because of necessity because of movement control. So we actually in 2020 we managed to recruit millions more customers who shop with us online. And secondly 139 million loyalty members because of the digital transformation so we can digitally connect to them. So in 2020 we actually doubled the development of our digital assets meaning content to continue to engage them and get them to continue to shop with us.,CKHUY,0.9999277591705322,0.9998555182549467,Positive
And in fact actually in several markets we become top brands in our Instagram and Facebook as well.,CKHUY,0.9821361303329468,0.9642722393704888,Positive
Our OO strategy has helped us to also transform the way we sell okay this is important because traditionally any retailers say they would be doing their business offline and then online separately. So for us actually in 2020 our store team in the store they are able to use WhatsApp WeChat telephone to help us to engage the customers and they convert sales also on the digital platform. So this is how the OO strategy help us to drive more growth.,CKHUY,0.9983044862747192,0.9966089705282275,Positive
And finally because of our physical store penetration so our OO strategy help us to have that fulfillment flexibility. So even during COVID when our online sales growth just now already mentioned is 90 so its doubled were still able to deliver within 1 hour within 2 hours or within the day doing COVID because we will to turn some of the physical store and to support the fulfillment.,CKHUY,0.1201787590980529,-0.7596435306331699,Negative
So in summary the OO strategy has accelerated a lot in 2020. And the physical store will continue to be a core touch point in this strategy. And in terms of store opening plan we will continue to have store opening in Asia Europe residentials locations and shopping malls provide the financial and modern expansion. So thats the OO strategy.,CKHUY,0.9956706166267396,0.991341228092449,Positive
This is Canning. I just want to add 1 more point. If you look at Watsons China approximately 80 of our revenue comes from our member okay If you look at OO revenue is 35 but it only come from 5 of our member. I just want you to think about this and this gets me very excited. This is  this tell you the size of the opportunity.,CKHUY,0.1949861943721771,-0.6100285709074562,Negative
So that I always say that when we fish  we go to a fish port people that we know but not dont go to the ocean where so many.,CKHUY,0.8113975524902344,0.6227948801486969,Positive
Watsons OO is a very exciting story. I think the potential is yet to be fully unleashed. Yes a lot of growth.,CKHUY,0.981258988380432,0.9625179544198239,Positive
Okay. Thank you. Thank you everyone. The next question is about infrastructure. What is the outlook of CKI in 2021,CKHUY,0.9964343905448914,0.9928687768392426,Positive
Now there are things that I think the market knows already and maybe I can add a few new things. What the market already knows is that there will be resets. And for the regulated business the resets happen every 5 to 8 years. So its always go go go until we have the year reset. And then goes down a bit and then it goes up again.,CKHUY,0.9999005794525146,0.9998011587865108,Positive
So this is normal for the business.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So in 2021 there will be a couple of resets which is part of the anticipated made plan for CKI. So that the market knows already. And the  not already also know that we are always looking for new opportunities. The new one is a new farm in Canada and providing pretty good stable return. So those are the basic things.,CKHUY,0.999597430229187,0.9991948599784732,Positive
Now going forward there are 2 things that maybe I can share. One is last  night before last the CMA has confirmed that the position on our appeal against the regulator.,CKHUY,0.8370617032051086,0.6741232121725156,Positive
Now in U.K. the regulator is usually the person setting the rate. If you are unhappy with the initial judgment you can appeal to the CMA. In that scenario most of the water operators accepted the regulators portfolio.,CKHUY,0.1994546353816986,-0.6010916835616134,Negative
We dont think its there and we appeal to the CMA. And all I can say is that the result of the CMA is a big improvement from the regulators original reset. We dont think it is 100 what we want but its just acceptable. And it is an improvement from the regulator.,CKHUY,0.7686346769332886,0.5372690780574549,Positive
Now the importance of that judgment is that not only does it set a rate for the water business but it is a cornerstone for all other infrastructure resets in the U.K. in the coming months and years. So it will affect the rates for gas as well as electricity. So 2 days ago the decision was as a time change.,CKHUY,0.8530325889587402,0.7060650027185695,Positive
I dont know whether its 1.5 days or 2 days. But the recent judgment is quite important news for CKI and for the U.K. utility business.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The second one second news maybe I can share is a breaking news. Literally about an hour ago 1 utility asset was sold in the U.K. at 73 premium to RAP thats what we infer from the announcement. Now if you use that ratio then the assets in CKI are worth a lot more than the share price would indicate.,CKHUY,0.8529738187789917,0.705947462289013,Positive
The  most of the assets are acquired by CKI in much lower premium to RAP. And so this confirms that in this market theres still a lot of  I use the word Indiscernible treasures. That is within the Hutch Group IPO and some of the CKI assets. So some of the valuations are yet to be fully appreciated.,CKHUY,0.7614189386367798,0.5228375928626019,Positive
Yes thank you. The next question is  we will take  will CK Hutchison equity account for dividend accounts IndiscernibleCenovus,CKHUY,0.9928547143936156,0.9857094202693819,Positive
So together with the personal or family ownership CKHH has  and family is the largest shareholder group in Cenovus and has influenced on the Board. And I think we should be equity accounting to say at the moment. Frank right,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Yes thats correct.,CKHUY,0.9902961254119872,0.9805922392560475,Positive
Yes. Sorry okay. Due to the time constraint maybe we have the last 2 questions. What is the outlook of Three U.K. in 2021 is one of them.,CKHUY,0.0211653709411621,-0.9576704249801785,Negative
Thats definitely a question for Canning.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. I think that in the budget they show that they will be much improved. And actually what we would like to do is to get the company back to where we were before when we talk about the merger with go to which is we made EBITDA of 700 million. After the merger fell through I think my team somehow cut this and changed and then get into trouble with IT and all those still keep on having one concern after the other so that as a result we have a brandnew management team since beginning of last year and that has been very effective and a nice change. Im not saying that the last team is no good.,CKHUY,0.0087221264839172,-0.9825569287281805,Negative
Its just that I think its a nice fresh air into the and then you can see that has stopped in the second half is actually 25 better than last year 2019. And then we will continue to see positive development in the U.K.,CKHUY,0.9979108572006226,0.9958217119107913,Positive
And also one thing worth mentioning is that we always have a handicap on spectrum because we are the smallest network we have the smallest spectrum in the overall 4G inflow but now with the 5G where we have the most spectrum and then also with the success of the  of getting the 700 spectrum is a very advantageous cost. This cost is almost 50 of the last time that we got the 800 so that we are very well equipped to go into the future as a major player. So U.K. I think the scenery is good for us.,CKHUY,0.9950515031814576,0.9901030004638438,Positive

Okay. The last question is still on Three U.K. 5G free U.K. has increased so much in 2020 and will 2021 be another heavy capacity year,CKHUY,0.0367993116378784,-0.9264025249496252,Negative
So we just said were building 5G. Canning maybe you can indiscernible I think its almost all network.,CKHUY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. I think that it is part of the U.K. problem which we are correcting and this core network which try to finish. And finally I think its finished now because that doesnt run into any problems for the last 2 months. So that I think a lot of things we are being good right. And of course with the new spectrum in the beginning of 5G and then but I told them that when they do 5G they indiscernible so lets see. And the figures will speak for itself but in U.K. is strong.,CKHUY,0.9660705327987672,0.9321410251504334,Positive

Good afternoon everyone. Thank you all for joining us. 2020 was the year of challenges and dramatic changes in the way we live. Its also a year where we were pushed to adapt and clarify what it is important to us. I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of the team here at WilliamsSonoma. Their dedication was the vital part of our ability to substantially outperform the industry and gain market share.,WSM,0.9998673796653748,0.9997347591726538,Positive
In Q4 despite shipping constraints and low retail traffic we delivered another quarter of accelerating revenue and profitability with 26 comp growth our highest quarterly comp of the year and 85 EPS growth. This strong end to the year combined with our outperformance throughout 2020 drove record fiscal year revenue growth substantial operating margin expansion and EPS that was almost double that of last year. As we look forward to the year ahead and the longer term future of our company we are confident in our ability to drive growth and improve our profitability. We have big goals and good reasons to believe that we will achieve them.,WSM,0.9999942779541016,0.9999885559013819,Positive
Today I want to spend the bulk of our time talking about our three key differentiators which set us apart and have become increasingly relevant. They are first our inhouse design second our digital first channel strategy and third our values. Lets start with our inhouse design capability.,WSM,0.998688578605652,0.9973771556479669,Positive
Our inhouse teams design our own products create original aesthetics and work with our talented vendors to bring quality sustainable products to market. Given that the bulk of our products cannot be found elsewhere and the design quality and value creation ph is so strong we have pricing power that others do not. Throughout this year we have been very deliberate in reducing promotions in all of our brands. Its a very significant and material change to our model. We have tested into this change replacing sitewide promotions with inspiring content and the effectiveness of this change is clear in our results including consecutive quarters of product margin expansion compared to last year.,WSM,0.9995286464691162,0.9990572923763348,Positive
In Pottery Barn the multiyear work to improve our value proposition is paying off. We are increasing brand relevance aesthetically with the successful launch of our proprietary rustic modern furniture collections and our famous casual lifestyle point of view. Our value engineer products are attracting new customers. We have introduced significantly more opening price points and our multistep finished high quality furniture pieces are the best value in the market. We will continue to develop assortments in proven adjacent categories to drive incremental growth.,WSM,0.9999998211860656,0.999999642371918,Positive
One example of this is bath renovation. The bath renovation market is 80 billion or 20 of the U.S. home improvement market. Through inhouse product development and our new marketplace model our bath renovation business is growing at a rate of nearly 30 per year and is projected to contribute an incremental 100 million over the next three years.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In Pottery Barn kids and teen we have amplified our leadership in design and sustainability in the childrens home furnishings business. We are proud to say that 100 of our wooden furniture offering is now GREENGUARD Gold certified aligned with our promise of products that are good for kids and good for the planet. In addition to strong core introductions of furniture we have added a new modern aesthetic that is growing at over 50 and attracting new customers to our brands.,WSM,0.9999891519546508,0.9999783038963697,Positive
Another example of growth is our baby business. Our baby business saw 23 growth last year and we are actively targeting the 2 billion plus baby registry market. West Elm has truly become the home furnishings brand of choice for millennials and millennial minded people. We continue to build the business with original design and by filling out white space and underdeveloped categories.,WSM,0.992689847946167,0.9853796871779485,Positive
For example this year we maturely expanded into seasonal dcor a historically small business for the brand. In the holiday season we sold out with many of the products within the first couple weeks of launch which built a strong foundation for further incremental volume in the years to come. Another category we are aggressively going after is outdoor. Currently West Elms outdoor business is less than half the size of Pottery Barn and doubling this business would drive an incremental 6 growth for the West Elm brand.,WSM,0.0309978127479553,-0.9380055296454011,Negative
Now Id like to talk about WilliamSonoma. This year marked the dramatic change in strategy for the brand. We implemented a content driven marketing strategy that featured exclusive products and relevant lifestyle stories instead of promotions. We also grew our exclusive products to 70 of our total business. This has been one of our key strategic initiatives to increase the mix of products only available at WilliamSonoma which has grown from 50 to 70 in the last five years.,WSM,0.9991275668144226,0.9982551325888231,Positive
Looking ahead well be even more aggressive in growing our exclusive product which we expect to reach over 80 of our total business by the end of FY 21. We also see significant opportunities in categories that are underdeveloped including the highend luxury furniture market. Our WilliamSonoma home brand is significantly underrepresented in this market and represents a substantial opportunity to drive growth and gain market share for the WilliamSonoma brand.,WSM,0.9912171363830566,0.9824342622961177,Positive
In addition to growth in our brands we also have growth in new customer segments such as business to business and the global home category. We are building our mighty businesstobusiness team ph and we are accelerating in sales volume across multiple industry verticals. Last year we drove over 350 million of revenues and we expect this business to surpass 500 million this year. In our global business our strategy for growth is through the capital life franchise model. We plan to double our revenues globally in the next five years led by the continued expansion of West Elm growth in our franchise operations as well as in our Canada ecommerce business.,WSM,0.9987965822219848,0.9975931630093828,Positive
Our second differentiator is our digital first channel strategy. One of the key reasons we outperformed was because our ecommerce platform was able to serve our customers at scale. We are uniquely positioned to take market share as the home industry shifts online. We are already the number one nonpure play ecommerce retailer in home furnishings and the top 25 ecommerce retailer in the U.S. across all industries and today our business is over 70 ecommerce.,WSM,0.984542965888977,0.9690859133517227,Positive
In our digital channels we have been acquiring new customers at record rates all year and our customer retention metrics continue to improve among new customers. We have the platform the supply chain infrastructure the tech stack and the talent to push our growth in ecommerce even higher. We are digital first but not digital only. Our stores are competitive advantage that support our online business for customers who want to experience our products in person as well as for those who prefer the convenience of our omnichannel services.,WSM,0.9965794682502748,0.9931589324229555,Positive
In the past quarter we increased our total buy online pickup in store and ship from source sales by over 130 as we leverage our retail network as fulfillment hubs. This is a huge unlock for our distribution operations and it is one of the reasons we were able to fulfill higher than expected volumes this holiday season despite gridlock issues that impacted the industry. As we look ahead our future growth will be driven predominantly by ecommerce. One of the key advantages of having built our tech platform inhouse is that we are able to implement and test new initiatives quickly and adjust based on customer feedback.,WSM,0.9997063875198364,0.9994127746896593,Positive
We already have several initiatives planned to further enhance customer engagement and conversion online. You also see our 3D visualization capability come to life as we introduce new functionalities to our design crew room planner including immersive multiproduct AR room layouts and 360 degree experiences. These enhancements are important because this tool drives sales. We saw a significant increase in the usage of this tool by our design associates and customers this year with total plans created a 55 compared to last year. Also those who utilize this tool currently generate twice as many sales as nonusers.,WSM,0.9961012601852416,0.9922025157228205,Positive
In our supply chain we are aggressively expanding our U.S. manufacturing and fulfillment capability by over 20 to 30 next year including adding close to 2 million square feet of distribution space to our delivery network. This will support our elevated demand particularly in furniture. To help mitigate industrywide shipping constraints and higher costs we will test and expand our inhome delivery to include small packages in addition to leveraging our omnichannel network.,WSM,0.996666431427002,0.993332858880078,Positive
Being digital first also enables us to explore new offerings and business models such as marketplace. Our marketplace assortment is of the same superior quality as the rest of our products often exclusive and sourced from our trusted socially responsible vendor base. Marketplace also leverages our website reach and is capital light. This year marketplace was just over 4 of our total business and we are planning to almost triple its size in the next five years.,WSM,0.9957577586174012,0.9915155121776535,Positive
Our third differentiator is our values. We care deeply about sustainability equity action and supporting our associates in the communities where we work. Our commitment to sustainability is one of the main reasons our customers choose us over our competitors. For example a recent survey found that our Pottery Barn customers are three times more likely to be in the top environmentally focused households. There is a direct correlation between the good work we are doing in the world and our increasing relevance with our customers and we are thrilled to be recognized for the work in this area. Just last month we were ranked at number 16 on Barrons 100 most sustainable companies up from 32 last year and we are continuing our recognition as the only home furnishings retailer on the entire Barrons list.,WSM,0.9132181406021118,0.8264361777521239,Positive
As we look to the future we will deepen our sustainability commitments further. Our Pottery Barn brand kicked off the New Year with a commitment to plant 3 million trees in three years where we will plant a tree for every piece of indoor wooden furniture we sell. Companywide well meet our 100 responsibly sourced cotton and 50 responsibly source wood goals and grow our selection of sustainably made products. Most exciting is our upcoming announcement of an ambitious public goal for carbon reduction across our operations and throughout our entire supply chain.,WSM,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
Diversity equity inclusion is also essential to who we are as a company. We continue to lead in gender equity and we are proud to be included in Bloombergs GenderEquality Index this year for our Gender Equity Achievements across talent gay culture and workplace policies. We also lead in LGBTQ Equity and continue to score 90 or higher in the Human Rights Campaigns Corporate Equality Index.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In order to improve racial equity weve established our equity action plan and although there is still a lot more to do we have made measurable progress. We have committed our ongoing support to over 25 national and local nonprofit organizations that advocate for racial justice and equity and have increased our Black AfricanAmerican representation through hiring partnerships and collaborations and of course we cannot over emphasize the value of our associates. Our people are at the heart of our business.,WSM,0.9807530641555786,0.961506105367008,Positive
In 2020 we continue to pay our associates during the initial months of COVID while our stores and offices were closed and provided several pandemic bonuses and hourly wage increases to our frontline workers throughout the year. To help protect the safety of our associates in our communities we continue to provide personal protective gear and COVID testing to our store and supply chain associates and through our WilliamSonoma Inc. Foundation we have given financial assistance to over 850 associates experiencing COVID hardship this year.,WSM,0.9468430280685424,0.8936859927689984,Positive
In addition to these COVIDrelated benefits we also enhanced our parental leave policy to provide more paid time off for both primary and secondary caregivers. The positive impact of all these initiatives was evident in our teams unwavering dedication throughout the year including the best holiday execution we have ever had. We will continue to follow through on our equity action plan commitments to advance racial equity both inside our company and in the communities we serve. We have set aggressive goals to further diversify our workforce vendor partners and collaborators and we are committed to providing transparency on our progress.,WSM,0.9997239112854004,0.9994478222416772,Positive
In summary our business excelled in 2020 despite the extremely difficult operating environment. We believe this reflects the power of our three key differentiators which we will continue to invest in to drive growth and gain market share.,WSM,0.9099979400634766,0.819995772836073,Positive
Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond we are very optimistic about our runway for growth and profitability. But before I give our financial outlook let me provide some insight into what we are currently seeing in our business. All of our brands are starting the year strong. Were seeing higher than expected ecommerce traffic and sales and continuing recovery in our retail comps. Our entertaining related categories such as Easter and Outdoor are driving very strong results for us giving us the confidence that this entertaining lifestyle trend will accelerate postpandemic as people welcome friends and families back into their home.,WSM,0.8967496156692505,0.7934991082543781,Positive
Our B2B business sales trends also continue to accelerate week after week. Growth in our global business is also building momentum driven by strong demand from our franchise partners and our ecommerce business in Canada. In addition our merchandise margins continue to expand as we have substantially reduced promotions. We will continue to chase inventory and unfortunately we are experiencing additional delays due to COVIDrelated slowdowns a firm shortage to the inclement February weather in the south and delays due to port congestion and a shipping container shortage. We are doing all that we can to expedite inventory flow for our customers but our instock recovery is now most likely pushed to Q3 and while this is a challenge it is also one related to our very strong demand.,WSM,0.0002067983150482,-0.9995875952169867,Negative
We expect the strong demand to continue through 2021 and beyond based on a number of factors. First is the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and our three key differentiators that will continue to set us apart from the competition and allow us to take market share. Second it is the recovery in our retail traffic and the replenishment of our inventory levels as we move throughout the year and beyond that will drive additional growth. And third it is the favorable macro trends that we believe will continue to benefit our business. These include high consumer confidence a strong housing market a continuing shift to ecommerce the expected continuation of working from home hybrid work and the importance of sustainability and values to the customer.,WSM,0.9332835674285888,0.8665670553249449,Positive
This gives us the confidence that we can deliver mid to high single digit revenue growth and operating margin expansion in 2021. Longer term our three key differentiators our inhouse design our digital first channel strategy and our values will drive profitable market share gains accelerating our path to 10 billion revenues and 15 operating margins in the next five years.,WSM,0.9839153289794922,0.967830638784551,Positive
Julie will speak to this financial outlook in more detail but before I turn the call over to her I want to express my sincere gratitude to our associates particularly our frontline workers in manufacturing and distribution who work tirelessly around the clock through the pandemic. Our incredible performance over the past year could not have been achieved without our teams innovation collaboration and hard work. I could not be proud of our associates and all that they have accomplished in taking care of each other our customers and our communities.,WSM,0.9991729259490968,0.9983458509122438,Positive
And with that I would now like to pass the call over to Julie.,WSM,0.9418123960494996,0.8836247227339287,Positive
Thank you Laura and good afternoon everyone. I also want to begin by thanking all of our associates for their resilience and hard work over the past year as we navigated an extremely challenging environment for making operational changes at the onset of the pandemic. To preserve liquidity and maintain strong financial health to managing the impact of widespread store closures while continuing to pay our people to fulfilling higher than expected online volumes as we grappled with partial shipping caps and supply chain disruptions we stayed relentlessly focused on taking care of all of our stakeholders our associates our customers and our shareholders and it was this focus that enabled us to report record fourth quarter and fiscal year results today.,WSM,0.9908852577209472,0.9817705045762684,Positive
In the fourth quarter net revenues reached approximately 2.3 billion with net comparable brand revenue growth of 25.7 and an even higher demand comp of nearly 30 which includes orders placed but not yet filled in the quarter. Ecommerce grew at a comp of 47.9 and our retail stores continue to improve sequentially ending the quarter with a negative comp of 7.6. This outperformed our expectations given the substantial COVID restrictions that were in place throughout the quarter and the overall decline in national store traffic of over 30.,WSM,0.9644831418991088,0.928966241458798,Positive
All brands drove strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. WilliamsSonoma delivered a 26.2 comp. Pottery Barn accelerated to a comp of 25.7 . West Elm accelerated to a 25.2 comp on top of last years 13.9 comp and Pottery Barn kids and teen accelerated to a comp of 25.7 and in our emerging brands rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined we delivered another quarter of over 20 growth.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Moving down the income statement gross margin expanded 450 basis points to 42.1 in the fourth quarter driven by another quarter of substantially higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. Higher merchandise margins resulted from significantly reduced promotional activity as we replaced sitewide promotions with relevant content across all of our brands. Occupancy leveraged 190 basis points in the quarter resulting from higher sales and relatively flat yearoveryear occupancy dollars at approximately 181 million.,WSM,0.969336986541748,0.9386739365303138,Positive
Our efforts to renegotiate rent and to close less profitable stores have enabled us to minimize our occupancy dollar growth and to deliver this occupancy leverage. While we did incur higher shipping costs yearoveryear from a higher mix of ecommerce sales and peak shipping surcharges from our thirdparty shippers we are pleased to see our selling margins which include these higher shipping costs sequentially improve again this quarter expanding 260 basis points yearoveryear and 110 basis points from the third quarter.,WSM,0.9946961998939514,0.9893923934652766,Positive
SGA in the fourth quarter was 24.2 of net revenues compared to 26.1 last year leveraging 190 basis points yearoveryear and sequentially improving 10 basis points as a rate from the third quarter. SGA dollars grew 15.5 compared to last year primarily driven by higher employment costs from increased incentive compensation given our fiscal year outperformance higher hourly variable pay particularly in our supply chain as our teams work to fulfill higher than expected volumes during the quarter and incremental pandemic related costs such as bonuses for our frontline workers work from home stipends for our corporate associates and increased levels of PPE and cleanings across our facilities.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Despite these incremental costs we were able to maintain a low SGA rate due to the strength of our sales volume and our overall strong financial discipline which kept SGA growth substantially below sales growth. As a result we delivered another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 92 to 410 million in operating margin expansion of 630 basis points to 17.9. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of 3.95 or 85 higher than that of 2019 at 2.13. These fourth quarter results combined with the outperformance we have seen throughout 2020 allowed us to deliver record financial performance on the year.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Some of our fiscal year 2020 highlights include net revenues at alltime highs in 2020 at nearly 6.8 billion including comparable brand revenue growth of 17. Our ecommerce business grew at a comp of 44.5 this year taking our ecommerce mix to over 70 or 4.8 billion of our total revenues. In retail we delivered a negative 22.5 comp despite substantial COVID disruptions with our stores closed or severely limited throughout the year and overall national decline store traffic of about 45. In addition our stores this year played an integral role in supporting our online growth through virtual design and omni fulfillment services.,WSM,0.8341952562332153,0.6683903148116557,Positive
By brand we delivered doubledigit growth and significant acceleration across all brands. Across the Pottery Barn brands costs accelerated 15.6 on top of 4.2 last year with Pottery Barn at a 15.2 comp in our childrens business Pottery Barn kids and team at 16.6 comp. WilliamsSonoma accelerated to a 23.8 comp driven by ecom comps well above 70. West Elm our largest growth initiative delivered their 11th consecutive year of doubledigit revenue growth and another year of doubledigit comps at 15.2 on top of last years 14.4 comp.,WSM,0.0165635645389556,-0.9668740432703755,Negative
Our emerging brands Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined delivered another year of doubledigit growth. Additionally our cross brand initiatives continue to gain scale and momentum most notably is our business to business division which delivered approximately 360 million in revenues for the year up 15 over last year and contributing an incremental 140 basis points to our total company comp.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In our cross brand loyalty program the key we enrolled nearly 4 million customers bringing our total membership to almost 12 million members or 23 over 2019 and our complimentary design crew services accounted for almost 50 of our fiscal year 20 instore revenue. This topline performance along with our strong financial discipline all year enabled us to generate operating income of over 960 million which was over 90 higher than 2019. This resulted in record operating margin expansion of 560 basis points to 14.2 and EPS of 9.04 almost double that of 2019. Additionally this level of earnings growth allowed us to substantially increase our return on invested capital from 22.4 to 38.1 with all brands substantially improving and significantly outperforming our peer set media.,WSM,0.0770869851112365,-0.845827129976231,Negative
On the balance sheet we ended the year with a cash with a cash balance of over 1.2 billion compared to 432 million in 2019 which reflects our strong financial performance and operating cash flow of almost 1.3 billion which was more than double last year. In addition to our strong cash balance we also ended the year with no amount outstanding on our line of credit. This strong liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of the business including nearly 170 million in capital expenditures primarily in technology and supply chain to support our ecommerce growth and to provide shareholder returns of over 300 million through dividends and cherry purchases.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
While many companies suspended their dividends in 2020 we continued to pay dividends to our shareholders all year including increasing our dividend payout by 10 this past quarter for an annual dividend payout to shareholders of 158 million. We also after initially suspending share repurchases repurchase shares at the same level as 2019 or approximately 150 million in the back half of 2020.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Moving down the balance sheet merchandise inventories were 1 billion 6 million for a decrease of 8.6 yearoveryear which was a 200 basis point improvement from the third quarter. While we are pleased to see a sequential improvement in our inventory position compared to last quarter and the gradual narrowing of the gap between demand and net cost this quarter we are continuing to work through our high back order levels with our vendor partners and expect to be back in stock to more normalized levels in the back half of 2021.,WSM,0.8962342739105225,0.7924684241225863,Positive
Now let me turn to our expectations for the year ahead and beyond. Given the ongoing strength of our business as we enter 2021 the expected recovery in our retail business and inventory levels as we move throughout the year as well as the macro trends that will continue to benefit our business we expect 2021 to be in line with our previously provided longterm financial outlook of mid to high singledigit revenue growth or 5 to 9 and yearoveryear operating margin expansion. As far as our capital allocation in 2021 we plan to first invest in the business and then return except cash to our shareholders. We expect to invest approximately 200 million to 250 million of business with over 85 of the capital spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives that primarily support our ecommerce growth.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In technology we are focused on enhancing customer engagement and conversion online and in the supply chain we are planning to spend primarily on the addition of two new distribution centers to provide an incremental two million square feet in DC capacity to support our elevated growth as well as various investments in automation to drive speed and efficiency throughout our operations. As the consumer and our business continue to shift more online so have our levels of ecommerce related capital spend. Over the last five years alone we have shifted from less than 50 ecommerce related spend to now over 85 of our estimated spend in 2021 and we expect this shift to hold at these levels going forward.,WSM,0.7680891752243042,0.536178073989197,Positive
We also plan to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and increased levels of share repurchases following the 10 quarterly dividend increase that went into effect last quarter we announced earlier today another doubledigit increase in our quarterly dividend of 11.3 or 0.06 to 0.59 per share. As far as sharing purchases we plan to increase our level of repurchases over last year. Today we also announced that our board has approved a new billion dollar share repurchase program which will supersede the remaining outstanding under our prior authorization.,WSM,0.9984596967697144,0.9969193917032431,Positive
While our staff is hovering around alltime highs we continue to believe that it remains undervalued given our projections for growth and profitability. As a result we believe investing in our own stock will also drive longterm financial returns. And finally given our strong liquidity position and our expectations for another year of robust operating cash flow generation we paid off our 300 million term loan early and expect to let our 200 million 364 day line of credit facility naturally expire in May 2021. All of these decisions reflect our confidence in the longterm growth and profitability outlook of our company and our unwavering commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.,WSM,0.998806357383728,0.9976127133445223,Positive
Longer term as Laura mentioned given the acceleration in our business along with the macro trends that should continue to favor our business for the long term we see a faster path to now reach 10 billion in net revenues and 15 operating margins in the next five years. We estimate that Pottery Barn will expand almost 3.5 billion in revenues. West Elm will grow double digits almost doubling in size to over 3 billion. WilliamsSonoma will reach almost 1.6 billion in revenues and our Pottery Barn kids and teen business will grow to 1.4 billion. This anticipated topline growth in addition to strong growth in our core business will be fueled by accelerated doubledigit growth across a number of our key initiatives including our B2B business expanding to a billion in revenues our marketplace business growing to almost three times the size of today to over 700 million our emerging brands expanding to a combined revenue of over 600 million and our global operations more than doubling in size to 700 million.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
From a profitability perspective further operating margin expansion should predominantly be driven by overall sales leverage from higher sales levels and a continued shift to our more efficient and profitable ecommerce business reduced occupancy costs from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and the expected closure of approximately 25 of our retail fleet as our leases come up for renewal continued strength in our product margins from an ongoing focus on more contentled marketing and more valueengineered highquality and sustainable products as well as overall strong financial discipline maintaining expense growth below sales growth.,WSM,0.9622052311897278,0.9244104173245533,Positive
In summary our record performance this year is a testament to the strength of our teams and the power of our three key differentiators our inhouse design our digital first channel strategy and our values. As we look at the next year and beyond we are optimistic about our business and given the favorable longterm macro trends including a strong housing market the disruption of brick and mortar and an accelerating shift to ecommerce the expected continuation of working from home in some capacity postpandemic and the increasing importance of sustainability and being a values driven company combined with our key differentiators our growth initiatives our doubledigit growth and new customer accounts and loyalty members our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive longterm growth and profitability resulting in market share gains and strong financial returns for our shareholders.,WSM,0.9998177289962769,0.9996354577752695,Positive

Thank you. Operator Instructions Our first question today will come from Adrian Yih with Barclays.,WSM,0.9938410520553588,0.987682096768675,Positive
Good afternoon. Congratulations. I mean it really is a nice topping to what was a difficult year but you made it through extraordinarily well. Laura so my first question is for you. It looks like the brands are all hitting sort of this accelerated sweet spot of growth here in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the foreign businesses You havent yet stepped into Europe and so were seeing some players in the space obviously launch into Europe kind of as their next phase of kind of TAM growth.,WSM,1.0,1.0,Positive
So can you talk about that first and foremost And then Julie really interesting on the occupancy line. I mean that is its pretty incredible that your sales grew 24 and your occupancy is flat. So I really wanted to understand what the occupancy line trajectory looks like for 2021. Should we assume its kind of flattish as we go through Q1 and then into the full year And then on the flip side of that on the merch margins are you at historically low levels of clearance and have you permanently changed the nature of the business such that we wont go back we wont mean revert back to historical levels of promo Thank you so much. And congrats again.,WSM,0.95596444606781,0.9119288396411176,Positive
Thank you. In terms of global we recognized as we travel the world that no one else is doing what were doing and weve had great success in really bringing ecommerce to some of these markets particularly the franchise partners who are very well established but didnt have a big ecommerce business and so we have we partnered with great people in the Middle East. We have a really sizable operation. In fact this week we just opened a brand new flagship store in Dubai that is phenomenal with a WilliamsSonoma Home Expression that is something you havent ever seen before. Two days in were off to a great start there and thats just yet one example of the great stores that were building together and the business were building together with our franchise partners around the world. There is still a lot of growth there.,WSM,0.9999854564666748,0.9999709129160124,Positive
West Elm is one that hasnt been as established in these franchise markets and then also ecommerce continues to be a higher percent of sales in these global markets. We announced last year that wed be going into India. We are still on track to do that. Its a little delayed but its a big market. Our forecast is that its one of the most sizeable for us and were very excited about that partnership. We want to do it really well and so we put off China and we dont have plans to enter China at this point. Similarly we are in London with West Elm. We have some things in some of the department stores there. We also have kids website but we dont have further plans to expand other than in ecommerce. Its just there is a lot more easy places to go right now than Europe with a long leases and also just the difficulty of doing business there. So were not doing a big push right now in Europe.,WSM,0.008455067873001,-0.9830910462683717,Negative
So regarding occupancy and your questions there so I think first of all if you look back youll see that we have been holding occupancy dollar growth down for a while now and we do expect that to continue. The important thing to remember is there is many things that go into occupancy like depreciation from capital investments also our distribution center rent. So there will be ups and downs but the reality is as I said in my prepared remarks if were closing apparently about 25 of our fleet at least that will lower our occupancy dollars and then potentially be offset by these other things that I just mentioned but then you combine that with the higher sales volume higher ecommerce volume and all of that leverages that line. So I do expect both to have more muted dollar growth but also the higher sales will drive that leverage going forward for the foreseeable future.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
As far as merchandise margins yes we do have some of the lowest levels of clearance inventory that weve had in the company and at this point in time we expect that to continue but its also the fact that weve made a decision to really pull off of sitewide promos and go after contentled relevant marketing. So instead of just doing a blanket email where we give you 20 off were getting more and more finetuned about what we serve up to you to give you what you want and if you want it you could only get it from us and that combined with the fact that we are value engineering the product to get at the right price and the right quality and the right sustainability levels and well never compromise on that. It puts it in a situation where if you want it you got to buy it its a great price so people are buying it. So that is we are going after that aggressively and thats why were so confident in merchandise margins continuing to expand going forward.,WSM,0.999976396560669,0.9999527930932004,Positive
Great. Very helpful. Best of luck.,WSM,0.9997640252113342,0.9995280501413644,Positive

And our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Again Steven Forbes your line is open. Go head please.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sorry about that. Good evening. I just want to follow up on the selling margin or merchandise marketing commentary you provided during the call. I think you said selling margins expanded 260 basis points during the fourth quarter. So can you remind us what that number was for the year and then as we think about the path to a 15 EBIT margin any commentary on the cadence of the selling margin profile in the business as you think about potentially cycling something some of these transitory headwinds whether it be clearance as you just mentioned or promotional activity. Do you see anything as it relates to cadence in the selling margin,WSM,0.8642382621765137,0.7284763625123278,Positive
I mean selling margins all year have been accelerating on from an improvement standpoint from an expansion standpoint. So again we expect that to continue going forward. I dont have handy right now the exact amount on the year but if you look back you can see by quarter that theyve continued to expand and this quarter in particular was the largest expansion. As far as puts and takes as to what could drive the selling margins I mean weve always said that the shipping costs are a part of selling margins and so that obviously has become something that weve been focused on more recently especially as our mix shift to ecommerce the more furniture we have and theres been higher rates that have come through with our thirdparty shippers. But I think the combination of the fact that we can drive these merchmargin expansion throughout and then you layer it with occupancy on top of it is whats been able to give us this incredible gross margin expansion for the entire year and so that is why were confident going forward thatll continue.,WSM,0.7995325326919556,0.5990648264079252,Positive
We obviously also are working specifically on shipping costs and trying to minimize those increases as much as possible to help with the selling margins going forward in addition to the merchmargin and whether thats using more of our omni fulfillment at our stores which has been a huge win for us obviously during this time and its a differentiator the fact that we have these stores as hubs around the country to obviously trying to figure out ways to take this larger items and bring it into our own delivery network and lowering some of the cost with our thirdparty shippers. Now at the same time we have great relationships with our thirdparty shippers and so were working with them to come to a great solution but we are focused not only on offsetting shipping costs but also lowering them in an absolute sense to keep driving these selling margins to where they are.,WSM,0.2245900928974151,-0.5508207385663622,Negative
Thank you. Best of luck. Stay safe.,WSM,0.9988406896591188,0.997681377936231,Positive
Thank you.,WSM,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore.,WSM,0.97648423910141,0.9529684501698319,Positive
Yes. Thanks guys. I had a question regarding labor costs. You mentioned COVID pay in 2020 but then also bonuses and all of that. So I wanted to see how you plan for 2021 and beyond for on labor costs,WSM,0.9285281896591188,0.8570562941171493,Positive
So our labor costs as we spoke to during the year have obviously gone up. Youve heard that from many other retailers especially the hourly rates and so across the board we have moved to a 14 per hour rate. So at least were at 14 per hour or even higher in our distribution centers in particular in certain areas. And so weve got a lot of that in our base. Obviously theres always pressure and we always look at the hourly wages on a market by market basis and we want to be competitive.,WSM,0.1802946031093597,-0.639411770946843,Negative
Our people have been the secret sauce if you will especially this year and so we are making certain that were taking care of them from an hourly rate perspective but since weve made these moves in the past its not as much of a headwind for us as it might be for others. On the flip side I think you mentioned COVID costs. We obviously expect that there will be reduced or eliminated COVID cost which is going to help us next year because those are fairly substantial and so youve got some moving parts.,WSM,0.0471923351287841,-0.9056164655783568,Negative
Labor youve got the utilization with these hourly wages and potential a little more pressure on the labor line. Youve got the fact that we may have some more advertising spend but on the flip side youve got COVID costs that are coming out. So it gives us a lot of confidence combined with our merchandise margin expansion and our occupancy leverage and with higher sales leveraging the entire PL that we can drive operating margin expansion next year.,WSM,0.9971200227737428,0.9942400421142832,Positive
Thanks very much Julie. Good luck.,WSM,0.9989309310913086,0.9978618609081871,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.,WSM,0.9830644130706788,0.9661288059525528,Positive
Thanks a lot and good evening. Congrats on a great quarter and year. My question is around the outlook very impressive in terms of the margin outlook particularly for 2021. Just perhaps you provide a little bit more color on the complexion of the margin expansion youre expecting in 2021 how much of it will be in gross margin How much of it in SGA you expect both of those to provide expansion to your operating margins,WSM,0.9998709559440612,0.9997419117342898,Positive
Yes. This is Julie. I will answer that question. So we expect expansion on both. Its obviously going to depend by quarter and were not giving quarterly line item guidance but at the end of the day were very confident in our merchandise margin expansion. Were very confident in our occupancy leverage and as I just mentioned on the last question that we have I guess benefit of some of these COVID costs that are going to be flipping out and yes we will have some increased costs but we will be able to more than cover that as a result of the higher COVID cost that will be coming out to cover it.,WSM,0.9998810291290284,0.9997620581162325,Positive
And so that combined with higher sales will allow us to leverage any of those costs that are coming through and drive operating margin expansion on the bottom line. And remember a lot of the sales that were driving now with an expectation of 70 or higher are going to be ecommerce and ecommerce we have historically been one of the most profitable ecommerce companies out there and so as we shift more and more to ecommerce that completely leverages the PL. So thats our expectation.,WSM,0.1076806485652923,-0.7846397665976088,Negative
Understood. Just to follow up if youre going to be expanding your operating margins seemingly materially in 2021 your goal is 15 in 2025 it seems like you dont have that much more expansion plan for 2022 through 2025. Is that just conservatism at this point in time,WSM,0.1027418971061706,-0.7945172754033063,Negative
Id say theres some conservatism but also we want to make sure that our value proposition stays really compelling and that our service is the best in the industry and so were its a bit of conservatism its also making sure we have the money set aside to invest back into the business to stay on top.,WSM,0.998440146446228,0.9968802910329646,Positive
Understood. Congrats and best of luck.,WSM,0.993246614933014,0.9864932218153608,Positive

Hi and congratulations also on a good quarter. I had two questions. One when you look at your demand trends are they prior based or are you seeing any notable differences in markets that where restrictions have been lifted or have higher vaccination rates versus those that dont So thats one and then my second question is on fulfillment. I wanted to see if you could talk more about the ship from store and how you can roll that further and help perhaps lower some of your cost to fulfill the orders and how do you see that evolving over the next couple years,WSM,0.9462735652923584,0.8925470665377775,Positive
Yes. So thank you this is Laura. Let me just first take the ship from store and then Im going to pass it to Felix to answer what were seeing or not seeing with the correlations. So in terms of ship from store ship from store is great because it leverages inventory that would otherwise be trapped in stores and helps us better fulfill customers demand and were getting better and better at it and driving it and marketing it correctly putting on filters to our sites they can sort for things and its an area that has grown up a ton more this year but there is still a lot more room for us to do more with that and in particular with bylines pick up in store.,WSM,0.9692272543907166,0.9384544720974399,Positive
So weve been pushing that as well not just because its COVID but because its another great way to service the customer who wants to get in and out quickly. So youre going to see us continue to market them better have better site experiences and put more power behind infrastructure. Im going to pass it to Felix what were seeing with vaccination and face opening and all that good stuff.,WSM,0.999955952167511,0.9999119042825129,Positive
Sure. Thanks for the question. What weve seen in our data is that demand for furniture is still very strong in states where vaccination rates are high. So theres no correlation between changes in state level that vaccination rates and our data and our growth in our furniture business. So what were seeing is its really not a zerosum game here. As more people get vaccinated as travel starts to open up as schools start to open up we have a substantial gear business a luggage business and as vaccination rates increase we expect people to open up their homes more. So our dining and entertaining businesses are primed for that. So early indications are no correlation in fact its a negative correlation is what were seeing. Were seeing strong rates across the board regardless of vaccination rates.,WSM,0.9816888570785522,0.963377692328508,Positive
And our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies.,WSM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi guys great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one was just on the WilliamsSonoma concept another remarkable quarter there. Curious what youre seeing as far as repeat spending trends now that were beginning to anniversary some of these cook and eat at home trends from last year. Any color there as far as kind of new and repeat customers would be helpful That was my first question.,WSM,0.9996891021728516,0.9993782039750838,Positive
Sure. First Ill say that yes WilliamsSonoma weve made a lot of changes to that strategy and its paying off from the exclusive to shifting from what was predominantly a store business to an online business and really driving content again which were thrilled to continue to do. In terms of the WilliamsSonoma categories that are working we are seeing great strength across the board particularly the areas where most dominant cookware cutlery electrics.,WSM,0.9994640946388244,0.9989281886387993,Positive
In terms of customer metrics we have very favorable customer metrics and its interesting we have very high orders per customer versus last year repeat customers and when you compare it to someone like a wayfarer and you see that we have higher dollars in all those categories strictly higher dollars per order we have extremely productive online advertising and online profitability as Julie mentioned earlier. Felix did I miss anything there Do you want to add anything to that,WSM,0.99886292219162,0.9977258430277367,Positive
No I mean just to reiterate we havent weve seen our repeat rates be very strong and as Laura mentioned all those new customers we acquired during shelter and place are returning at record rates and actually shopping across our portfolios at record rates. So we think that our share of wallet within these new customers will continue to grow as we introduce them to not just the best of WilliamsSonoma but what our other brands have to offer in leveraging our loyalty program to encourage them to shop across our portfolio.,WSM,0.9944130182266236,0.988826029793042,Positive
Great. Thats super helpful and then just a quick one Id squeeze in. Design crew I think you mentioned around half of instore revenues and I think you mentioned those customers are spending around two times as much. So just curious youve had a lot of success integrating kind of outward with room planner and all that. How are you thinking about maybe capital for potentially other tech related MA options going forward Any color there with your thoughts would be helpful. Thanks.,WSM,1.0,1.0,Positive
I thought you were going to ask a different question I was ready for the other one which is I wanted to tell you that one of the most amazing things that happened during the shutdown is that the people who worked in store who couldnt work did virtual design chat and they have done such a phenomenal job that its a whole new channel for us now. So we have the online design services where you dont need to do anything but use our tools. In fact you can power yourself the 3D tour tool which nobody has done that before. Other people allow you to pay and have their designers send you back 3D models. You can actually go on yourself as a customer and do it or you can call a store go into a store or you can do it virtually.,WSM,0.9999620914459229,0.9999241828466552,Positive
And so yes we are continuing to shift capital dramatically from brick and mortar to online services online ecommerce and infrastructure for supply chain that supports it all and that shift is remarkable. Julie you want to give a few numbers,WSM,0.9981856346130372,0.996371267063181,Positive
Yes. We used to spend less than 50 basically on ecommerce spend ecommerce related spend I should say and now were spending about 85 are expected to this year and we expect thatll hold to be higher. So our complete shift in capital is going to ecommerce now and thats one of the examples that well be spending on as well.,WSM,0.9266235828399658,0.8532470782083739,Positive
And as it relates to innovation we have a lot of great stuff that were building inhouse that is as good as anything Ive seen and of course were always looking at the landscape to see how we can get a jump on anything that we had already planned to do anyway.,WSM,0.9997668266296388,0.999533652981313,Positive
Very helpful. Thanks for the color.,WSM,0.9988589882850648,0.9977179752099368,Positive
Thank you. Our next question will come from Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker.,WSM,0.991568684577942,0.9831373591049668,Positive
Congratulations guys. Amazing quarter amazing year and I love the way the stores look right now. Your transition spring has been beautiful. So Laura and Julie I guess kind of a bigger picture question here to start the home space has become very popular getting a little bit more crowded online. So you outlined some of your key differentiators. Would that also fit into like what are your differentiators online What are your advantages that you have on ecommerce that differentiates you and separates you from the pack as it gets more crowded,WSM,0.9969730377197266,0.9939460718310307,Positive
Great question Marni. Thank you. So online we really bring not just a single product to life but a lifestyle and so we have spent a long time the PIP the Product Information Page is the lifestyle. And everything that is on that page needs to help you make that decision whether its 3D or UGC which we have really amped up online and then different guided shopping paths if youre interested in something and were seeing that really help us add on to an order if you went on to look for one thing to be able to show you and have you add something else and inspire you to buy things you didnt think you were looking for and versus our competition. There is a lot of people selling many things but sometimes its about really helping the customer make a decision and if they trust you with your quality and your sustainability and your value equation the conversion is higher.,WSM,0.9999980330467224,0.9999960660911,Positive
So we know that the work that weve done to build the brand actually through our stores in a lot of cases and through our catalogs is now coming to fruition online and so we continue to make the investments in the things that make it easier for the customer to make a decision whether thats swatches color accuracy 3D modeling in rooms immersive experiences and just simply reallife photography showing people how other customers have used something really makes a difference. Id say the other thing thats really different about us is that with all these different brands run by separate people such a wealth of ideas and innovation and we can try something in one brand and then not bet the farm and push it across multiple brands once we know it works and Elisas team is very innovative in looking at AB testing and always trying something new and thats been a big part of our success with our key tech partners.,WSM,0.9995645880699158,0.9991291756207799,Positive
That actually makes a lot of sense. Could I just ask a quick followup to it also I guess its a two part followup even. The trends that you are seeing that emerged during COVID which one do you think will be stickiest postpandemic and also it sounds like in spite of the enormous growth online and all your work online it sounds like in every turn you are still talking about the stores and it sounds like thats still important part of the story. Is that how you are thinking going forward,WSM,0.9995602369308472,0.9991204733374557,Positive
Yes. Lets talk about the on trends that we see. When you think about first of all we are so excited that the back team is underway and we are still hopeful for reopening of the economy once we reached immunity. The hope has always been your biggest investment. Home values have gone up overtime historically for Americans. They invest in their home. They know that they usually get it back and this year its the better piece. Everything you were there too much. And you learned a lot new things. And lot more you know the people learned to cook. Once you learn to cook you never go back. You may go out for dinner but you are going to cook better. And you are always going to be interested in the cooking trend. And that is key to the future of WilliamsSonoma.,WSM,0.9999998807907104,0.9999997615812788,Positive
I would say secondly entertainment. We have been able to entertain. Some people like actually be able to get together for Easter July 4 and imagine the holidays. We are busy dreaming of the most inspiring Christmas parties New Years parties that we can host in our homes and how we make that better for our customers and we cannot wait to serve our customers.,WSM,0.9997566938400269,0.9995133873900099,Positive
Also outdoor. We like fresh air. Nobody got this. Nobody even got the cold or the flu. I think you are going to stay outdoors a lot more than you did before. We are seeing as I mentioned strength in West Elm outdoor well by the way its equally its going to Indiscernible and WilliamsSonoma homes and if you havent seen the new WilliamsSonoma home catalog take a pick at that because its dominant this way of luxury outdoor that I think you will be extremely inspired by.,WSM,0.8848196864128113,0.7696392355199071,Positive
The last picture and I just want to talk about obviously hybrid work from home. I dont know about you but I still have a really accomplished the perfect work from home station. I still have desk to buy. You have been so busy you just dont get around. There is still a lot more room to make those work from home spaces better and new home builds are going to include it. So thats the business we are willing to play in and we have that work phase business in West Elm and we continue to grow it and we have a lot of guidance and innovation on work from home. So there is a lot of opportunities for us Marni and its just whether its product growth strategy or business to business or channel strategy you take the gross strategy together and you put it with our three key differentiators and the macro I am telling we are going to have a great ride here and its a multiyear ride.,WSM,0.8323681950569153,0.6647361902810278,Positive

Thank you Jennifer. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter and yearend 2020 conference call. On behalf of the entire team Id like to say we hope that you and your friends and families remain healthy.,CALA,0.9999974966049194,0.9999949932068546,Positive
2020 was a challenging year for the nearly everybody as we face new challenges in public health. Despite the challenges we faced we are quite hopeful for the future. At Calithera 2020 was a year of execution. We successfully completed and reported results of our global randomized trial in renal cell carcinoma early in 2021 while advancing our pipeline of novel therapeutics. We want to thank all of our employees who have done an extraordinary job of maintaining a high level of professionalism productivity and dedication at work particularly towards helping us achieve our goal of reporting top line results of the CANTATA trial in January. Were both appreciative and proud of our entire team for accomplishing a number of challenging goals. And while we are disappointed in the results of the CANTATA trial we remain enthusiastic for the potential of glutaminase inhibition to be a novel approach to the treatment of cancer. And we remain committed to our mission of being an integrated biotechnology company that develops novel small molecule oncometabolism drugs drugs that are targeting tumor and immune cell metabolism pathways for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.,CALA,0.997803032398224,0.995606062177457,Positive
By building a pipeline of novel therapeutic product candidates we are creating multiple opportunities to positively impact clinical outcomes for patients and drive development programs towards commercialization. We are continuing to develop telaglenastat and we are enrolling the randomized KEAPSAKE trial in first line nonsmall cell lung cancer patients harboring genetic mutations in KEAP or NRF2. We also continue to evaluate telaglenastat in multiple indications including investigatorsponsored trials.,CALA,0.9802899956703186,0.9605799678444671,Positive
Our partnered arginase inhibitor program is ongoing with Incyte where we have a number of clinical trials evaluating CB1158 for the treatment of cancer. While we remain committed to and confident in the 1158 development program we have decided to opt out of our codevelopment obligations at this time effective September 30 2020 as permitted under the terms of the Incyte agreement in order to focus our resources on our own internal development programs. As a result of our decision to opt out Incyte will pay all costs to develop 1158.,CALA,0.9208663702011108,0.8417326460675276,Positive
Arginase inhibitors also have potential in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. And accordingly we selected CB280 a unique oral arginase inhibitor for the treatment of this patient population. In November 2020 we announced that we were awarded up to 2.4 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to support clinical development of CB280. And we are grateful to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation for their support and were pleased to be working with them.,CALA,0.9962128400802612,0.9924256756458734,Positive
We have a broad pipeline and a productive RD team and we remain focused on producing novel drug candidates with the potential to be highly differentiated new therapies in areas of unmet needs.,CALA,0.99426531791687,0.9885306289974622,Positive
And with that I will pass the call over to Keith for additional details on our clinical programs.,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Susan. Lets begin with a more detailed update on telaglenastat our glutaminase inhibitor in development for the treatment of firstline lung cancer in patients with KEAP1NRF2 mutations. Mutations in the KEAP1NRF2 pathway which occur in an estimated 20 of nonsmall cell lung cancer patients are associated with aggressive disease. Numerous recent reports of clinical data have demonstrated that activation of this pathway either through the loss of KEAP1 function or activation of NRF2 are associated with poor clinical outcomes among patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer receiving frontline standard of care therapies including chemotherapy immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy.,CALA,0.0001572966575622,-0.9996865985909693,Negative
Preclinical models have shown that activation of the KEAP1NRF2 pathway makes tumors dependent on glutaminase activity for growth and survival making these tumors exquisitely sensitive to inhibition of glutaminase activity by telaglenastat.,CALA,0.0456242263317108,-0.9087526850418359,Negative
The doubleblind telaglenastat trial known as KEAPSAKE enrolled the first patient in September 2020 and will enroll approximately 120 patients. Eligible patients are newly diagnosed with Stage IV nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer with tumors that have the KEAP1 or NRF2 mutation. Patients will be randomized to receive telaglenastat or placebo in combination with pembrolizumab carboplatin and pemetrexed. The study will evaluate the safety and investigatorassessed PFS of telaglenastat plus the standard of care chemoimmunotherapy regimen. We plan to share interim data from this trial in the second half of 2021. We are also conducting an exploratory Phase IbII trial in collaboration with Pfizer combining telaglenastat with IBRANCE.,CALA,0.1481353640556335,-0.7037302873911188,Negative
In 2020 we announced the initiation of the first clinical trial to evaluate our novel arginase inhibitor in cystic fibrosis and we are pleased with the enrollment to date. The depletion of arginine in cystic fibrosis patients by the enzyme arginase results in reduced production of nitric oxide a key antimicrobial and bronchodilator. Therefore arginase inhibitors have potential in the treatment of cystic fibrosis and we have selected CB280 a unique oral arginase inhibitor solely owned by Calithera for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.,CALA,0.9389541745185852,0.8779082762648323,Positive
In October 2020 we presented a trial in progress poster describing the trial design at the North American Cystic Fibrosis conference. The presentation included preclinical study results which suggest CB280 significantly improved lung function and reduced pseudomonas aeruginosa colonyforming units in preclinical models.,CALA,0.9425705075263976,0.8851409465914644,Positive
Arginase inhibition with CB280 resulted in improved central airway resistance in CFTR knockout mice and decreased lung infection in wildtype and delta F508 CFTRexpressing mice infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa. We plan to share data from this trial in the second half of 2021.,CALA,0.0012601315975189,-0.9974809273963734,Negative
Weve also identified CB668 an investigational firstinclass potent orally administered IL4I1 inhibitor as a novel immunooncology approach to cancer. CB668 is an inhibitor of the enzyme IL4I1 an enzyme that is expressed by tumor cells and antigen presenting cells metabolizes phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan to produce hydrogen peroxide an inhibitor of T cell function. IL4I1 expression has been correlated with poor outcomes in several tumor types has a potential role in immunization and may decrease the ability of checkpoint therapy to stimulate an antitumor immune response. IL4I1 expression is elevated in multiple tumor types with particularly high expression in ovarian and Bcell tumors. New preclinical data for CB668 was presented in November 2020 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Virtual meeting.,CALA,0.999845027923584,0.9996900556624269,Positive
With that Ill pass it over to Stephanie for an update on our financials.,CALA,0.2467603087425232,-0.5064802804471733,Negative
Thank you Keith and good afternoon everyone. Detailed financial results for the fourth quarter and yearend of 2020 were included in todays press release. I will briefly review our results on this call.,CALA,0.9997841119766236,0.9995682236958885,Positive
Calithera remains well capitalized. Our cash cash equivalents and investments were 115.2 million at December 31 2020 which we believe will be sufficient to meet our current operating plan through 2022. RD expenses were 71 million in 2020 compared to 76.3 million in 2019. The decrease was due to a 6.2 million decrease in the 1158 program and a 3.8 million decrease in early stage research partially offset by an increase of 2.7 million in the telaglenastat program and an increase of 2.0 million in the CB280 program.,CALA,0.0117236673831939,-0.9765538433515093,Negative
RD expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were 17.1 million compared to 17.9 million for the same period last year.,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
GA expenses were 20.4 million in 2020 compared to 16.6 million in 2019. The increase was primarily related to a 2.5 million increase in personnelrelated and facility costs and a 1.3 million increase in professional services. GA expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were 5.6 million compared to 4.6 million for the same period last year.,CALA,0.0013029873371124,-0.9973952158660984,Negative
Interest and other income net was 1.3 million in 2020 compared with 3 million in 2019. Interest and other income net for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 0.1 million compared to 0.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31 2020 was 22.6 million.,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And with that I will now return the call back over to Susan.,CALA,0.7669520974159241,0.5339039170169335,Positive
Thank you Stephanie. And with that Joelle were happy to open the line for questions.,CALA,0.9905754327774048,0.9811508543198433,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Citi. Your line is now open.,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
This is James on for Mohit. First question any color on the enrollment progress for KEAPSAKE I know were on track for data later this year but can you give us a little bit of a number at this point Or is that still sort of a work in progress,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then related to KEAPSAKE there was some recently some data from KRAS showing that STK11 mutation patients had a higher response to the KRAS inhibitor. And I know that you guys have previously mentioned that the KEAPSAKE trial will have a good proportion of STK11 patients. So I was wondering if Calithera looked at combining 11 stat with any KRAS inhibitors,CALA,0.9938461780548096,0.9876923487736873,Positive
Yes. James this is Keith. In terms of enrollment so as we said were planning to enroll and make public SEM data from the initial interim analysis later this year. I think enrollment has been I would say impacted by COVID. I think all  if you probably asked anyone there has been some impact from COVID but its something were working through and we remain confident in our time line to be able to get to that  to data on that interim analysis later this year. So definitely some impact but something that we are working through.,CALA,0.95065176486969,0.9013034709116645,Positive
In terms of the KRAS story its definitely one were quite interested in. And thats sort of a I guess I would say a work in progress something were looking into on our side. But an area of a lot of interest and I think theres been a couple of different reports on the impact of STK11 that actually between the two clinical KRAS inhibitors that were somewhat different so that will be interesting to see how that plays out. But that definitely remains a combination of interest.,CALA,0.9998360872268676,0.9996721742583357,Positive
Our next question comes from Matt Phipps with William Blair. Your line is now open.,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I guess just kind of a followup on that interim. I mean this will be an interim for PFS I see right as opposed to maybe just response rates. And Keith are you still thinking of PFS in the control arm of around 7 months Or has there been any data lately there to change that assumption,CALA,0.7968292236328125,0.5936582050670416,Positive
So that  so yes in terms of  Matt in terms of the assumptions weve actually been for this population so for the KEAP1 immune population the data that have been reported in a few different places put that probably the median somewhere in the 3 to 5month range. So  and this is in frontline. So these patients do very poorly and so thats what were assuming.,CALA,0.9916975498199464,0.9833950897425949,Positive
And yes in terms of the data that we would be talking about its probably a combination of PFS as well as response rates. The data will be  its going to be an interim analysis and the data will still be kind of maturing. So were not going to be talking about fully mature data but we do  given the short expected PFS median PFS for the control arm we would expect to hopefully see some  see some daylight between the 2 curves and be able to see a trend in the right direction there.,CALA,0.0362983345985412,-0.9274044796255111,Negative
And any chance we see an update from that IBRANCE combo in pancreatic this year,CALA,0.7792891263961792,0.5585779896843373,Positive
We havent guided on that. I think its a little hard to say exactly when it will likely be this year or next. But that study really just started enrolling. So I think its too early to say with certainty.,CALA,0.918283462524414,0.8365668276350662,Positive
Our next question comes from Jonathan Chang with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
First question can you provide your latest thoughts on how much and how mature the second half interim data set for KEAPSAKE could be,CALA,0.930688977241516,0.8613778718578049,Positive
Jonathan yes in terms of the  were expecting somewhere in the range of 40 to 50 patients worth of data by the end of the year. And I think thats kind of the ballpark. Its  as weve talked about before the analysis is not explicitly defined in the protocol with  and having a specific sort of statistically driven endpoint or analysis. Its not a futility analysis. Its not an early efficacy analysis. Its an administrative interim that allows us to have an early look at the data and react as appropriate which could mean any number of things reaching out to regulators starting to prepare for a subsequent study. So thats the kind of the spirit of the interim.,CALA,0.935051679611206,0.8701032817979346,Positive
And in terms of maturity I guess I would say obviously patients who were enrolled later as that  as we get closer to the interim analysis those patients will be more likely to be censored and have less mature data. The hope is to have hopefully a couple of scans for those patients so that we can get a feel for the median PFS. As we talked about the median is in the range of 3 to 5 months for the control arm we would expect. So if we can start to see separation at that early time point that would be encouraging.,CALA,0.9992740154266356,0.9985480299878298,Positive
And last question how are you thinking about potential business development opportunities for your pipeline,CALA,0.9338594675064088,0.8677188561671116,Positive
Well this is Susan Jonathan. In general we remain open to partnering opportunities as one of several ways to continue to develop our pipeline. We will read out this year the first data in cystic fibrosis patients. And we have a clear picture of where we might go next if that data look encouraging and there might be a partnering opportunity somewhere along the cystic fibrosis development time line. And as you know we do have an earlier stage pipeline assets that are IND ready. We have a CD73 small molecule oral inhibitor and we also have an inhibitor for IL4I1. And partnering is a possibility for those as well. And for telaglenastat well wait and see what develops. But were always open to partnering at the right time for the right reasons.,CALA,0.9999998211860656,0.999999642371918,Positive
Our next question comes from Arthur He with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So I have two. So regarding the KEAPSAKE study maybe I missed. Could you give us some color on the  regarding enrollment And second regarding the Phase III study of telaglenastat with IBRANCE could we expect any data update this year,CALA,0.0301690697669982,-0.9396630165952545,Negative
Yes. Arthur in terms of enrollment for KEAPSAKE while we dont usually give sort of specific numbers of patients enrolled I did mention that there is  there has been some impact from COVID. I think theres  its probably multifactorial both at the level of the sites who have staff impacted in various ways as well as patients since this is a frontline study and the patients getting diagnosed in the frontline setting is necessary for patients to be enrolled through the study. So  and I think there are ways in which COVID is impacting clinical studies and were like everyone else experiencing that. But as I mentioned we still remain on track we think for data by the end of the year.,CALA,0.127034842967987,-0.745931354720208,Negative
The  and then in terms of the IBRANCE study that study is enrolling and were monitoring the data there. I have no real update there from an enrollment perspective. I think we talked about the data probably either this year or next with that study but hard to be more specific than that at this point.,CALA,0.0387403964996337,-0.9225203529121597,Negative
Our next question comes from Matt Phipps with William Blair. Your line is now open.,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Coming back on. Keith I was wondering if we could talk just  walk through some I guess hypothetical next steps after this interim. So obviously youll present the data depending on the level of activity but is it  okay maybe we go take it to the FDA Or is it okay were just going to continue to let the trial run out Or is there  does the trial having some kind of builtin adaptation to expand enrollment to maybe make it pivotal if things are looking good Just curious what kind of potential next steps are after this interim look in the KEAPSAKE.,CALA,0.9417906403541564,0.8835812113173074,Positive
So thats a great question and those are the kinds of things were thinking about. For example we can always reach out to FDA with the data if theyre compelling. And for example talk about breakthrough designation talk about either amending the current study or starting the planning for a subsequent pivotal Phase III. So those are the kinds of things that by looking early we can kind of get a start on what we think the best path is. And again all of those are really options. And probably an interaction with FDA would be part of that if we were looking to move forward with an accelerated sort of path to approval in some way.,CALA,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
Do you imagine the  trying to reach out with the FDA would occur before you even present the data given abstract submission time lines,CALA,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So I would say FDA  interacting with the FDA is independent of any kind of presentation at a meeting. So I wouldnt link those to each other. And frankly what were talking about isnt necessarily even a  I think what weve talked about in the past is that this may or may not be an actual conference presentation so  or may be a prelude to a conference presentation. So that the discussion this year wouldnt necessarily be in the context of a conference.,CALA,0.9619258642196656,0.9238516830513974,Positive
Thank you. Im not showing any further questions. And our next question comes from Nick Abbott with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.,CALA,0.9948389530181884,0.9896778998839255,Positive
And I apologize I missed nearly all of the prepared remarks. So I want to ask a question on the NCI study of telaglenastat and I know you may not have a lot of insight into that trial but was updated at the end of January theyre still talking about having data in June. So do you have any insight into that trial And is this a way also to help derisk KEAPSAKE in some of these patients who may also have a KEAP1 mutation,CALA,0.0065325498580932,-0.9869360845900087,Negative
Yes. So actually we  as we talk about of  hi Nick by the way we dont have any real insight at this point that we can share on the study. So I think its an interesting question whether its about KEAP mutant patients or just looking at the combination with TKIs targeting driver mutations I think its an interesting study and we look forward to learning more about it. But at this point its not something that were able to speak to.,CALA,0.9738321304321288,0.9476642296697075,Positive
Okay. And then just  I know there had been a few questions on the IBRANCE combination. Can you remind us when the colorectal and nonsmall cell lung cohorts were open for the KRAS mutations And is that the data youre referring to is possibly being available by the end of this year or beginning of next,CALA,0.9992083311080932,0.9984166612724428,Positive
So thats a good question. Youre testing my memory of when the study opened and Im not sure Im going to be able to answer that accurately without looking it up. So I apologize. I can say the pancreatic  the pancreatic cohort opened more recently. So that was one that we added to the study by amendment. And so that was I think opened late last year. But the timing of the colorectal data  or the colorectal and lung cohorts opening I dont know if I can answer that for you as we sit here. I will say though that the data that we could present could be those data and the pancreatic I think data from any or all of those cohorts is possible. But well get back to you on the timing of that the start of the study. Im sure I should have that ingrained in my head somewhere.,CALA,0.9999604225158693,0.9999208449845585,Positive
Thank you. I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jennifer McNealey for closing remarks.,CALA,0.0216380059719085,-0.9567251543552605,Negative

We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2020 and I thank all of our associates for their extraordinary efforts over the past year to support our customers our communities and each other.,DG,0.9974167346954346,0.9948334663113751,Positive
Despite a challenging operating environment our team remains steadfast in their dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others by providing affordable convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials. And I could not be more proud of their efforts.,DG,0.9997884035110474,0.9995768067698518,Positive
Throughout the pandemic our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and customers while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve as an essential retailer.,DG,0.2330656945705413,-0.5338695251163992,Negative
In response to the COVID pandemic we implemented several safety protocols enhanced our benefits and leave policies invested in personnel and personal protective equipment dedicated certain store hours for the most vulnerable members of our communities and most recently removed barriers for our frontline associates to receive the vaccine.,DG,0.2109127640724182,-0.5781754125210121,Negative
In total we invested approximately 248 million in response to the pandemic in 2020 including about 167 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees to demonstrate our appreciation for their exceptional performance during an incredibly challenging year.,DG,0.2141860127449035,-0.5716289112740227,Negative
At Dollar General we remain committed to being part of the solution and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our network of more than 17000 stores located within five miles of approximately 75 of U.S. population.,DG,0.8706873059272766,0.7413744577017174,Positive
At the same time we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for longterm sustainable growth.,DG,0.9351784586906432,0.8703568401079416,Positive
To that end were excited to share an update on some of our plans for 2021. First we plan to further the rollout of several valuecreating initiatives including our nonconsumables initiative Fast Track and the completion of our initial rollout of DG Fresh.,DG,0.9481914043426514,0.8963827469246071,Positive
In addition while still early we are very pleased with the results of our pOpshelf stores which have far exceeded our initial expectations for both sales and gross margin. As a result we plan to accelerate our pace of new store openings for pOpshelf in 2021 and expect to incorporate this concept into a number of our largerformat Dollar General locations as we look to capitalize on the significant growth opportunity we see for this differentiated concept.,DG,0.7982510328292847,0.5965018251549155,Positive
We are also pleased to highlight key changes to our development strategy including plans to build on the success of our Dollar General Plus store or DGP and the introduction of two new store formats which we began testing in 2020.,DG,0.991689145565033,0.9833782812227494,Positive
Similar to our largerfootprint DGP concept the first new format has a selling space of approximately 8500 square feet which compares to about 7300 square feet of selling space for our traditional store.,DG,0.9739079475402832,0.9478158639763976,Positive
Beginning later this year this new format along with our DGP concept will become our base prototype for nearly all new stores replacing both our traditional and higher cooler count DGTP formats allowing for a more optimized assortment and room to accommodate future growth.,DG,0.9236152172088624,0.8472303433599138,Positive
Our second new format is even larger with approximately 9500 square selling feet and will be deployed opportunistically across new store relocation and remodel opportunities. Notably on average our DGP and new store formats are outperforming the chain on a comp sales basis and have considerably higher sales volumes compared to both the traditional and DGTP store which bodes well for the future as we look to increase their unit counts in the years ahead.,DG,0.991003394126892,0.9820067775289876,Positive
Finally we are pleased to provide an update on a number of our new small box store opportunities we see available in the continental United States which represents an increase compared to our prior estimate.,DG,0.9982842803001404,0.9965685585549824,Positive
Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. But first lets recap some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. The quarter was once again highlighted by strong growth on both the top and bottom lines.,DG,0.9543924927711488,0.9087849311738798,Positive
Were pleased that for the quarter our three nonconsumable categories once again delivered a combined comp sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. Of note this represents our 11th consecutive quarter of yearoveryear comp sales growth in our combined nonconsumable categories which we believe speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories.,DG,0.9729151129722596,0.9458301936567985,Positive
From a multicadence perspective comp sales in December increased in the high singledigit range with similar midteens growth in both November and January. In total fourth quarter net sales increased 17.6 to 8.4 billion primarily driven by comp sales growth of 12.7. These results include significant growth in average basket size and units in particular partially offset by a decline in customer traffic. And while customers continue to consolidate trips on average they are spending more with us compared to last year.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Once again this quarter we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data driven by a meaningful increase in both units and dollars. Importantly our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q4 of 2019. These new customers continue to skew younger higher income and more ethnically diverse underscoring the broadened appeal of our value and convenience proposition.,DG,0.9888561964035034,0.9777123795225497,Positive
We continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers and we are working to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives.,DG,0.9595947265625,0.919189404958132,Positive
Were particularly pleased that we delivered significant operating margin expansion which contributed to fourth quarter diluted EPS of 2.62 an increase of 24.8 over the prior year.,DG,0.9481698870658876,0.8963397123454289,Positive
For the full year net sales increased 21.6 to 33.7 billion including net sales growth of 28.1 in our combined nonconsumable categories. Comp sales for the year increased 16.3 representing our 31st consecutive year of samestore sales growth. In 2020 we celebrated the opening of our 17000th store and the launch of our newest store concept pOpshelf.,DG,0.8006102442741394,0.6012202508570259,Positive
In total we completed a record 2780 real estate projects during the year exceeding our initial target of 2580 projects as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
From a position of strength we also made targeted investments in other key areas including the acceleration of certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape.,DG,0.9905446767807008,0.9810893422897713,Positive
Collectively our fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful longterm shareholder value.,DG,0.9941401481628418,0.9882802893401916,Positive
As a mature retailer in growth mode we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward.,DG,0.9994807839393616,0.9989615672597689,Positive
We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. And in an environment where customers continue to seek safe and convenient experiences we believe our unique store footprint further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success.,DG,0.999780535697937,0.999561071134252,Positive
Overall I am proud of our associates and all that weve achieved over the past year. We feel very good about the underlying business and Im excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.,DG,0.896786093711853,0.7935720643830684,Positive
With that Ill now turn the call over to John.,DG,0.1773987412452697,-0.6452034981271615,Negative
Thank you Todd and good morning everyone. Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year let me take you through some of its important financial details. Unless we specifically note otherwise all comparisons are yearoveryear. All references to EPS refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year.,DG,0.9991790652275084,0.9983581294763857,Positive
As Todd already discussed sales I will start with gross profit which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales including the impact of COVID19. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5 in the fourth quarter an increase of 77 basis points which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of yearoveryear gross margin rate expansion. This increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales higher initial markups on inventory purchases a greater proportion of sales coming from nonconsumable categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. These factors were partially offset by increased transportation and distribution costs which were impacted by increased volume some of which is attributable to the COVID19 pandemic as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees.,DG,0.9938201308250428,0.9876402542831031,Positive
SGA as a percentage of sales was 22.2 an increase of 48 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by incremental costs related to COVID19 including appreciation bonuses paid to our frontline retail employees and health and safetyrelated expenses as well as increased incentive compensation expense and hurricanerelated expenses. These items were partially offset by certain expenses which were lower as a percentage of sales including occupancy costs retail labor and depreciation and amortization.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Moving down the income statement. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 21 to 872 million. As a percent of sales operating profit was 10.4 an increase of 30 basis points. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by COVID19 primarily through higher sales. The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately 96 million or 110 basis points of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic including approximately 69 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees and additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7 and compares to 23 in the fourth quarter last year. Finally as Todd noted earlier EPS for the fourth quarter increased 24.8 to 2.62 which contributed to full year EPS of 10.62 an increase of 59.9.,DG,0.9626533389091492,0.9253066332975823,Positive
Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times while continuing to invest for the long term and provide meaningful returns to shareholders. Merchandise inventories were 5.2 billion at the end of the year an increase of 12.2 overall and 6.3 on a perstore basis.,DG,0.714354932308197,0.42870952410073526,Positive
While a lot of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain highdemand products we continue to make good progress with improving our instock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels.,DG,0.8961190581321716,0.7922379924285368,Positive
In 2020 we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling 3.9 billion an increase of 1.6 billion or 73.2. Total capital expenditures for the year were 1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores remodels and relocations distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives.,DG,0.9939690828323364,0.9879381584752551,Positive
During the quarter we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for 900 million and paid a quarterly dividend of 0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of 87 million. With todays announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization we have remaining authorization of approximately 2.4 billion under the repurchase program.,DG,0.1957655847072601,-0.6084697893081841,Negative
Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. Our first priority is investing in highreturn growth opportunities including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments all while maintaining our current investmentgrade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted debt to EBITDA.,DG,0.960859477519989,0.9217189083808115,Positive
Moving to our financial outlook for 2021. We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID19 pandemic including its impact on the economy consumer behavior and our business. Despite continued uncertainty we are providing select annual guidance in an effort to provide the best view we reasonably can based on what we currently know.,DG,0.9995641708374025,0.9991283411552558,Positive
That said there could be a number of potential headwinds and tailwinds this year which are not incorporated into our guidance as the timing degree and potential impacts on our business are currently unclear including but not limited to the recently approved government stimulus package other unknown external factors related to the ongoing health crisis including its impact on consumer behavior and additional changes to minimum wage rates.,DG,0.9915719032287598,0.9831437964104393,Positive
With this in mind we currently expect the following for 2021. Net sales in the range of a 2 decline to flat a samestore sales decline of 4 to 6 but which reflects growth of approximately 10 to 12 on a twoyear stack basis and EPS in the range of 8.80 to 9.50 which reflects a compound annual growth rate between 15 and 20 or between 14 and 19 on an adjusted basis over a twoyear period which is well above our longterm goal of delivering at least 10 annual EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Our EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22 to 23.,DG,0.9605081677436828,0.9210162884094049,Positive
Capital spending is expected to be in the range of 1.05 billion to 1.15 billion as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. With regards to shareholder returns as outlined in todays press release our Board of Directors recently approved a quarterly dividend payment of 0.42 per share which represents an increase of 16.7. We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately 1.8 billion of our common stock this year reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the longterm growth opportunity for our business. Finally as noted in todays press release our outlook for 2021 real estate projects remains unchanged from what we stated in our Q3 earnings release on December 3 2020.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our expectations. Given the unusual situation I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q1. Despite approximately 8400 lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country samestore sales for the month of February increased 5.7 reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of 11.2 on a twoyear stack basis. From the end of February through March 16 comp sales decreased approximately 16 as we are in the midst of lapping our most difficult monthly comp sales comparison of the year. As a reminder comp sales growth for the month of March in 2020 was 34.5.,DG,0.1371994018554687,-0.725602224828139,Negative
Looking ahead we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook given the continued significant uncertainty that still exists as well as the unique comparisons against last year. That said as you think about the sales cadence of 2021 our performance is expected to be stronger in the second half given a more difficult sales comparison in the first half and particularly in Q1.,DG,0.9414307475090028,0.8828614251979743,Positive
Turning to gross margin. In 2020 gross margins benefited from a greater proportion of sales coming from our highermargin nonconsumable categories driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories well in excess of our consumables business. We expect our sales mix will ultimately shift towards our consumables categories in 2021 resulting in pressure on our rate. However the timing of when this dynamic may occur and its corresponding impact to gross margin are currently uncertain.,DG,0.0033815205097198,-0.9932381470430774,Negative
Gross margins in 2020 also benefited from a reduction in markdowns including the benefit of higher sellthrough rates as a result of significant customer demand in seasonal and other clearancesensitive nonconsumable categories. In 2021 we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels we saw in 2020 which likely will create some gross margin pressure compared to last year.,DG,0.1201298832893371,-0.7597412823088661,Negative
In addition while we continue to see the effect of higher carrier rates and fuel costs our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses including further expansion of our private fleet are expected to help partially mitigate these cost pressures in 2021. Also please keep in mind that the second and third quarters represent the most challenging laps of the year from a gross profit rate perspective following improvements of 167 basis points in Q2 2020 and 178 basis points in Q3 2020.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In terms of SGA while we expect to incur ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021 overall we anticipate a meaningful reduction in COVID19related costs compared to last year. However the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage associated with lower comp sales and approximately 60 million to 70 million in incremental yearoveryear investments related to our strategic initiatives as we further the rollouts.,DG,0.0266302227973938,-0.9467407147531002,Negative
With regard to our strategic initiatives in aggregate we anticipate they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021 driven by NCI and DG Fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associate expense. Finally we estimate operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately 35 million to 40 million in Q1 as a result of lost sales from storage closures and expenses related to the widespread winter weather that we experienced in February.,DG,0.9742358922958374,0.9484717538784468,Positive
In closing we are very proud of the teams execution and performance which resulted in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results. As always we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term. We remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable samestore sales growth healthy new store returns strong free cash flow and longterm shareholder value.,DG,0.9892400503158568,0.9784800878048465,Positive
With that I will turn the call over to Jeff.,DG,0.8319525718688965,0.6639049434095283,Positive
Thank you John. Let me take the next few minutes to update you on our operating priorities including our strategic initiatives and plans for 2021. Our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth. The team did a fantastic job in 2020 executing against our portfolio of growth initiatives. Let me highlight some of our more recent efforts as we look to further build on our progress in 2021.,DG,0.9999810457229614,0.9999620914233276,Positive
Starting with our nonconsumables initiative or NCI. As a reminder NCI consists of a new and expanded product offering in key nonconsumable categories. The NCI offering was available in more than 5800 stores at the end of 2020 including nearly 400 stores in our light version. This compares to our prior expectation of more than 5600 stores at yearend.,DG,0.848255455493927,0.6965107300941527,Positive
Given our strong performance to date we plan to expand this offering to about 5700 additional stores this year bringing the total number of NCI stores to more than 11000 by yearend. This total includes over 2100 stores in our light version which incorporates a vast majority of the NCI assortment but through a more streamlined approach.,DG,0.2071001231670379,-0.5858006988767976,Negative
Moving to our newest concept pOpshelf which further builds on our success in learnings with NCI. pOpshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience delivered through continually refreshed merchandise a differentiated instore experience and exceptional value with about 95 of our items priced at 5 or less.,DG,0.9995507001876832,0.9991013998397591,Positive
We opened our first five locations in 2020. And as Todd mentioned given our strong results todate we plan to accelerate the rollout of pOpshelf in 2021. In fact we are now targeting to have a total of up to 50 pOpshelf stores opened by year end compared to our previous goal of about 30 total locations. In addition to these stores we also plan to incorporate this concept in up to 25 Dollar General stores in 2021.,DG,0.9835805892944336,0.9671611590153926,Positive
In terms of our storewithinastore concept a smaller footprint pOpshelf shop will be prominently positioned in the center of the store and we will display both Dollar General and pOpshelf branding on exterior entrances to build and maximize awareness.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
From these initial stores our goal is to test learn and ultimately expand to more locations over time as we look to leverage the unique strengths of these complementary formats and build on our early success with pOpshelf by making it more available to a broader range of customers.,DG,0.9999641180038452,0.9999282359649158,Positive
Turning now to DG Fresh which is a strategic multiphase shift to selfdistribution of frozen and refrigerated goods. The primary objective of DG Fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing.,DG,0.7756326198577881,0.5512649722486569,Positive
In fact DG Fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative.,DG,0.9150153398513794,0.8300305783930888,Positive
Another important goal of DG Fresh is to increase sales in these categories. We are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front driven by higher overall instock levels and the introduction of new products in select stores being serviced by DG Fresh.,DG,0.9841954112052916,0.9683908035700339,Positive
Given our success todate we are further accelerating the rollout of additional offerings with the recent introduction of even more products including both national and private brands as we look to further optimize our assortment while increasing our relevance with customers. And while produce is not included in our initial rollout plans we believe DG fresh provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more than 10000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive selfdistribution capabilities.,DG,0.9941426515579224,0.988285296133337,Positive
In total we were selfdistributing to more than 16000 stores from 10 facilities at the end of 2020. This compares to our previous expectation of over 14000 stores at year end. Overall we remain well on track to complete our initial rollout across the chain in 2021.,DG,0.0187199115753173,-0.9625613466270846,Negative
Moving to our cooler expansion program which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative. During 2020 we added more than 62000 cooler doors across our store base. In total we expect to install more than 65000 cooler doors in 2021 as we continue to build on our multiyear track record for growth in cooler doors and associated sales.,DG,0.9998977780342102,0.9997955559465623,Positive
As a reminder in 2019 we began incorporating highcapacity coolers into the majority of our new remodeled and relocated stores creating additional opportunities to drive higher onshelf availability and deliver a wider product selection all enabled by DG Fresh.,DG,0.9985078573226928,0.9970157128666117,Positive
Next a quick update on our FedEx relationship. This convenient customer package pickup and dropoff service is now available in over 8500 stores with plans to be in a total of over 9500 stores by year end further advancing our long track record of serving rural communities.,DG,0.088146835565567,-0.823707415883193,Negative
In addition to the gross margin benefits associated with NCI and DG Fresh we continue to pursue additional opportunities to enhance gross margin including improvements in private brand sales global sourcing and supply chain efficiencies. With regards to our supply chain our plans for 2021 include further expansion of our private fleet which accounted for more than 20 of our outbound fleet at the end of 2020.,DG,0.8643609285354614,0.728721695376453,Positive
Reducing stem miles is also an important contributor to these efforts and the recent opening of our Walton Kentucky dry distribution center is expected to drive additional efficiencies as we move ahead.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We also plan to open two additional DG Fresh facilities in 2021 as we look to further optimize our fresh network and support future growth. In addition we anticipate our combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Blair Nebraska will be completed in late 2022 which should contribute to a further reduction in stem miles overtime.,DG,0.9998087882995604,0.9996175763711785,Positive
Finally while we are very pleased with our progress in 2020 shrink reduction remains an important area of opportunity. We continue to build on our success with electronic article surveillance by increasing the number of items tagged while further leveraging technology to drive even higher levels of instore execution.,DG,0.9453397989273072,0.8906795326945383,Positive
Our second priority is capturing growth opportunities. Our proven highreturn lowrisk real estate model continues to be a core strength of our business. In 2020 we completed a total of 2780 real estate projects including 1000 new stores 1670 remodels and 110 relocations. Additionally we now have produce in more than 1100 stores.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For 2021 we expect to open 1050 new stores remodel 1750 stores and relocate 100 stores representing 2900 real estate projects in total.

In addition as Todd noted earlier we continue to advance the evolution of our store base with plans to build on the success of our DGP format including the introduction of two new format types. With about 8500 square feet of selling space both our first new format and DGP concept allow for expanded higher capacity cooler counts an extended queue line and a broader product assortment including NCI a larger health and beauty section and produce in select stores.,DG,0.7948282957077026,0.5896563468315283,Positive

QuestionandAnswer Session,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions Our first question today is coming from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead.,DG,0.9972628355026244,0.9945256677422925,Positive
Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So it looks like youre guiding to about 60 basis points of operating margin expansion between 2019 and 2021. Why wouldnt it be more than that Given youre comping better than your algorithm would suggest on a twoyear stack basis plus youre benefiting from all these marginenhancing initiatives like DG Fresh Fast Track NCI and others. And how  within that how would you expect your gross margin to shake out this year versus 2019,DG,0.9896096587181092,0.9792193050499591,Positive
Yes. So Ill tackle both those questions Michael. This is John. First of all Id say were really pleased with what we did in 2020 expanding our operating margin 223 basis points. We didnt give specific guidance on operating margin or the components. But we did call out that some of the headwinds the biggest headwind being the SGA deleverage that goes along with lower comp sales this year.,DG,0.1495127379894256,-0.7009755378815758,Negative
We also talked about anticipating a mix shift back toward consumables which does have a margin impact to both the sales mix as well as markdowns as we would be lapping unusually low clearance markdowns last year. And then we also mentioned higher carrier rates and fuel costs. So these are all costs that pressure operating margin overall.,DG,0.289295494556427,-0.4214098581134428,Negative
Now you also asked about gross margin. As you think about gross margin again we feel great about what we did this year delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion. This is our seventh consecutive quarter doing that 117 basis points for the year. And to your point initiatives like DG Fresh and NCI are really contributing and impactful to the biggest drivers that we called out.,DG,0.9553115367889404,0.9106230203050496,Positive
The three biggest drivers we called out were lower markdowns higher initial markups and the mix benefit in NCI and DG Fresh were significant contributors to those. But we also as I mentioned are seeing in the near term higher distribution and transportation costs. So as we look ahead in the near term these will weigh in the near term. But as you look at the longerterm we do feel like were well positioned to continue expanding  resume expanding gross margin and operating margin over the longer term for the reasons you mentioned the scaling of these initiatives that are the gifts that keep on giving and all the levers weve talked about before within gross margin and within SGA.,DG,0.9996565580368042,0.9993131156641935,Positive
But at the same time its noted that we continue to invest in the business. And so to make sure we sustain our ambition of being 10 doubledigit EPS growers over the longterm we are continuing as we called out to reinvest in the business. We mentioned 60 million to 70 million thats hitting SGA next year. And then the other thing Ill mention is in terms of COVID expenses we will continue to have some COVID expenses associated with protecting and ensuring the health and safety of our employees and customers. How much that is going to be varies on what the situation dictates. But weve captured all our best estimates in the guidance for these drivers.,DG,0.9828140139579772,0.9656280074286503,Positive
Understood. Thats very helpful. And my second question is very myopic. And were all just trying to figure out whats going to happen as we get through the next several months. And if we just take the math of down 16 versus the 34.5 in March of last year it would imply a high teens twoyear stack. So can you give us some flavor for how March unfolded last year Have you  are you just now entering the toughest compares within the month such that a high teens twoyear stack would be kind of a false positive indication on what to expect over the next few months,DG,0.0857285261154174,-0.8285440376663434,Negative
Yeah. I can help you there Michael. Ill start by saying its bumpy right Theres a lot of noise. You had the storm in February. And then in March youre extrapolating over a very short period of time which was pretty bumpy last year. But to help you out here we called out yes as you mentioned the negative 16 monthtodate from the end of February through March 16th this year. If you look at the corresponding period of time last year it was not dissimilar to the 34.5 comp where we ended the period so fairly representative. But again theres a fair bit of noise within this so Id be cautious in extrapolating too much based on that. But hopefully that helps you understand where we were at this point.,DG,0.9951138496398926,0.9902276934550365,Positive
That certainly does. Thank you so much and good luck.,DG,0.994715452194214,0.9894308980887523,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,DG,0.978800356388092,0.9576006875042244,Positive
Thanks. Good morning everyone. A couple of questions I guess first on the comps. The 10 to 12 that you mentioned in the release on a twoyear stack it actually felt like thats a doable number going forward if you take all the initiatives. And so  yet youre still going to have stimulus at least in the first part of the year probably now and for a little while longer. And so I guess the top line feels a little conservative in that regard. Just can you talk about that Any thoughts around it why  if the 10 to 12 in our view is doable why couldnt the topline end up being a little bit stronger,DG,0.9999985694885254,0.9999971389753455,Positive
Sure. Let me unpack that for you. And again just dialing the clock back a little bit weve said historically that this model works really well at a 2 to 4 comp. Thats the engine of the 10plus EPS growth algorithm. So with a twoyear comp stack of 10 to 12 over two years that represents a pretty meaningful stepchange improvement over that.,DG,0.9863862991333008,0.9727725820377957,Positive
And I tell you we feel great about the fundamentals of the business. As you said the relevance of the brand the broadening appeal the new customers weve brought in the bigger baskets were enjoying Id say the business model has never been stronger. And as noted the initiatives are really clicking and contributing to this relevance.,DG,0.9841650724411012,0.9683301260054864,Positive
So we feel good about the guidance that weve provided. But we did note that  and its based on what we know but what we did note was that we didnt include the impact of stimulus. because its really relatively unknown what impact it will have to what degree it might help. So thats not taken into consideration in the guidance. It could be an upside. I hope it is. But theres just a lot of uncertainty when you think about one compared to the previous stimulus rounds which helped us the economy is opening up now more. And so we are competing with other segments of the economy outside of retail for that share of wallet. So how much we get is uncertain.,DG,0.9988027811050416,0.9976055607828862,Positive
And then the other piece is surveys of consumers have said that they plan to save more this time. They plan to spend more paying off bills. Now a lot of times what people say and do is two different things and so it remains to be seen if thats the case. So were cautiously optimistic. We didnt build it in. It could be an upside but its just very difficult to say if it will be upside and to what degree.,DG,0.9587661027908324,0.9175321564269996,Positive
Okay. Thats helpful. And then my followup and maybe take another shot at something Michael just asked. If you look at the gross margins versus 2019 and John you mentioned some transportation costs is there any reason why they shouldnt be higher than 2019,DG,0.9992690086364746,0.9985380164015392,Positive
Yeah. Again I dont want to get into the specifics of guidance around operating margin for this year. We wanted to give  theres a high degree of uncertainty we wanted to give some guidance that we gave the top line and the bottom line.,DG,0.949909806251526,0.8998195527908524,Positive
Ill just say that were really pleased with the performance weve been delivering over the last few years growing our gross margin and the operating margin again over two points this year. But again theres a lot of unknown this year a lot of potential pressures. With that comp that we mentioned when you look at this year that does create some deleverage. And again we are investing in the business. Now again that investment piece is accretive but then you do have other pressures such as carrier rates and then obviously you do have other inflationary pressures.,DG,0.000962883234024,-0.9980754244777111,Negative
Fair enough. Thank you very much. Good luck.,DG,0.9999202489852904,0.9998404978755102,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.,DG,0.978800356388092,0.9576006875042244,Positive
Great. Thanks. So Todd or John maybe on the samestore sales acceleration to the mid  that weve seen so far what have you seen from discretionary versus consumables,DG,0.9993547201156616,0.9987094394620892,Positive
And then on the doubledigit twoyear stack that you forecasted for this year how much of the acceleration relative to the past two years do you believe is driven by new customer acquisition or market share gains Trying to get a sense for that twoyear stack of doubledigits relative to midtohigh single digits the trailing two years. How much of this acceleration do you believe is sustainable,DG,0.8174510598182678,0.6349019020211113,Positive
Yes. This is Todd. Yes I would tell you let me take the second part first. I would tell you that that comp we believe that we are retaining a nice portion of the new customers that we saw come in. We can see that with our data at a pretty good realtime rate. And the great thing is weve seen them continue to come back so repeat as well. So we feel good about that going into 2021. We see them still here in 2021 which is really good to see.,DG,0.999992609024048,0.9999852180392852,Positive
And again with all of our initiatives Matt that weve got put together I would tell you that it gives her a lot of confidence to continue to shop with us. So I know Im not going to give you exactly what youre looking for but I would tell you that it plays a portion of it. But I would also say that all of our initiatives also really come into play here.,DG,0.999756395816803,0.9995127913432069,Positive
And then what weve seen so far just to give you a little bit more color nonconsumables or that discretionary side of the business continues to do very well for us into the early part of Q1 here. And as we move through March it will become even more meaningful because as you recall the stockup trip from last year with the pandemic with paper and cleaning and many of the consumable food perishable areas really took off last year and nonconsumables were a little soft quite frankly. And were seeing the opposite quite frankly right now. So thats great to see.,DG,0.9980286359786988,0.9960572696073473,Positive
But what we can also see is that our initiatives around nonconsumables has really helped because our baskets seem to be a little higher with those nonconsumables in them as well. So theyre spending at a good rate there and we believe that shell continue to do that as we move into the middle part of the year.,DG,0.9959533214569092,0.9919066380897987,Positive
Great. And then maybe just to follow up John on the SGA front. Could you just help quantify what youve embedded in the guidance from a COVID expense perspective just so we can baseline it And then ex the strategic investments is there any change to 2.5 to 3 I think thats roughly been the underlying comp leverage point in the model. Any change to that,DG,0.999805748462677,0.9996114966937879,Positive
Yes. Ill tackle both of those. First in terms of the COVID spend obviously were going to do whats necessary to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers. The guidance captures the best guess of the spending needs associated with that. Thats of course going to vary based on the severity and duration of the pandemic. But safe to say weve built in a considerable reduction of that assuming an improvement of the situation there. And thats whats captured in the guidance. We didnt give a specific number on that but it is a considerable step down.,DG,0.9995447993278505,0.9990895981130592,Positive
As you think about SGA and the 2.5 to 3 leverage point weve kind of dissuaded people from sticking to that because there is that geography that you noted. One we are investing in SGA to drive overall operating margin expansion particularly gross margin. And so as you look at things like DG Fresh as were taking over selfdistribution NCI you spend a little bit on SGA to save a lot more and drive a lot more benefit on gross margin so its very beneficial overall. But it does throw off the math on that.,DG,0.8928263187408447,0.7856525097206293,Positive
And then there are some other initiatives like pOpshelf and others that are more have more of a startup cost nature. So it pressures that. And then the other thing weve done is weve really stepped up the remodels and so that puts a little bit of pressure on the front end of that. So if you strip all those out thats a lot to strip out that as well as the COVID expenses yes were still looking at that 2.5 to 3 leverage point. Nothing has structurally changed. And our  certainly our focus on cost containment is sharper than ever. But thats really the only change to that.,DG,0.1995372772216797,-0.6009263997831343,Negative
But for the next few years as we scale those and we operationalize DG Fresh you have to put a little bit of labor in the stores for instance and a little bit of contract labor to remodel the stores. Thats really the big driver there. But overall its accretive from a dollar perspective and a rate perspective.,DG,0.9896530508995056,0.9793060894644794,Positive
Thats great color. Best of luck.,DG,0.9981266260147096,0.996253249796182,Positive
Thank you.,DG,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,DG,0.978800356388092,0.9576006875042244,Positive
Good morning guys. So I apologize upfront about another salesrelated question. But we do know that the stack comps start to get distorted when we deal with bigger numbers and bigger swings. So if we were to basically dollarize your comps for lack of a better term it looks like there really wasnt much of a change in your sales run rate like from a sales per store perspective between March  February and March.,DG,0.8282932043075562,0.6565862039245391,Positive
So two questions first is that a fair assumption And then related to that assuming you maintain a pretty steady  are you assuming that youre going to maintain a pretty steady sales per store cadence for the balance of the year or are you expecting a deceleration in kind of sales per store during the course of the year as we hopefully enter a more normalized environment,DG,0.9972147345542908,0.9944294657882844,Positive
Yes thats a good question. Ill start with the second question. As you look at the guidance we provided this year we do  a key element of that is assuming that we retain a considerable portion of the new customers that came in and the bigger baskets that came in. A big piece of that is the initiatives weve put in place like NCI that position us so well to get a piece of that share of wallet as people came into the brand and like what they saw as well as the coolers that provided a fuller fill in trip when people are looking for groceries.,DG,0.9998758435249328,0.9997516869018594,Positive
So weve assumed a pretty considerable retention of that. But as weve looked at it throughout the year weve also said that the share of wallet probably will shift a little bit. Right now there is concurrent with the pandemic there is a consolidation of trips and were benefiting from that as well as again benefiting from that share of wallet.,DG,0.9991755485534668,0.9983510961241102,Positive
So as you go through the year we assume you do lose a little bit of that tailwind as youre competing with other segments of the economy for that share of wallet. But still very positive on how much we can retain and again the fundamentals of the business and the relevance of the brand as people have come in.,DG,0.2306315600872039,-0.5387377969847902,Negative
And again as we said I dont want to dissect February and March too much because again it was pretty bumpy with the storms in February and a lot of puts and takes in March and again youre extrapolating over a pretty short period of time. So when you strip out all the noise I would tell you that again with the guidance we provided that contemplates what weve seen up to this point. And I think the wildcard is again stimulus and we just didnt put anything in for that because we just dont know what that benefit will be and to what degree.,DG,0.0025746524333953,-0.9948518841575887,Negative
But John just to be clear like in terms of sales per store maybe a different way to look at it did you see much of a change between February and March,DG,0.7814114093780518,0.5628225581780424,Positive
No I would say as you strip out some of the noise I mentioned we think the core business is performing similar and performing very well when you look at those stacks.,DG,0.8777521848678589,0.755504224004879,Positive
I appreciate that. Thank you.,DG,0.9944635629653932,0.9889271193308351,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Karen Short of Barclays. Please go ahead.,DG,0.9815518260002136,0.963103630008477,Positive
Hi thanks very much. I just wanted to get a little bit of color in terms of how we should think about kind of the composition of traffic versus ticket as we go into calendar 2021 I mean obviously you saw a pretty meaningful I think deceleration in traffic in February but thats off of a pretty high number in February of the prior year. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about that just broadly.,DG,0.9999558925628662,0.9999117850731523,Positive
And then I wanted to talk a little bit more about 22 as it relates to gross margins. So the question I have on that is how should we think about the base level of gross margin for 2022 Because it seems like you are at a much more permanently elevated base on the gross margin front. And I know 2021 is just so hard to talk through because there are so many moving parts but I wanted to kind of pivot the conversation to 2022 on the gross margin front.,DG,0.0025451481342315,-0.9949108927910882,Negative
Thanks for the question Karen. Ill take the first part and then kick it over to John for the 2022 gross margin discussion. So on the traffic side again February was pretty choppy. You had the storms that quite frankly we  you saw in the release 8500 store hours of lost time but the bigger thing is we  for a day to almost two days we had anywhere from 20 to 30 of our store base close for that time. So its a little choppy to be able to talk about traffic in February and then whats happened in March. But I think the way to look at it is we feel really good about that traffic number overall where we see it. It was very similar to where it had been coming out of Q4.,DG,0.0864925980567932,-0.8270158928727466,Negative
As John said as you start to pull away some of these puts and takes I think its important. We saw a little bit of an uptick in traffic when that stimulus came out the second round of stimulus. And with only a couple of days to measure weve seen an uptick in traffic and overall sales with this recent stimulus. But again I caution its still very early to tell whats going to happen here.,DG,0.0007123053073883,-0.9985765806296949,Negative
But I think the bigger picture is were retaining a lot of those customers as I mentioned earlier that we got during the pandemic. And were still working very hard to keep Dollar General top of mind to those customers so that when she continues to consider where to shop for her everyday needs and many of these new nonconsumable type items that weve got in our stores she still comes to us.,DG,0.8766807913780212,0.7533614357480023,Positive
So we believe were seeing that repeat customer. And theres no reason why  we deserve and have the right to keep that customer based on our service of her in the past as well as what we believe we can do in the future for her. John,DG,0.998848795890808,0.9976975904092729,Positive
Yeah. And then to the second part of the question and I agree with you theres just a lot of noise in 2021. I think one thing I would point to as you look at over that two year period lots of puts and takes. But when you get to the bottom line a two year CAGR of 15 to 20 I think really speaks to the stepchange performance in the top line and the flowthrough. It makes you feel good about the future.,DG,0.9621264338493348,0.9242528225498337,Positive
Now I dont want to give specific guidance around 2022. Its premature for that. But as you unpack the drivers of gross margin in Q4 and for the full year as I mentioned its the strategic initiatives which are the core drivers of that. And those still have a lot of tentacles and legs to those that help us going forward. And were reloading with other initiatives to help drive gross margin.,DG,0.9713374972343444,0.9426749603003024,Positive
Now the one thing that we mentioned just  2020 a little bit was the mix so thats why we cautioned that we expect the mix to normalize or move back toward consumables somewhat which is a bit of a drag. But the thing  the other items driving that gross margin expansion we expect to continue. And so thats why I mentioned that as we get through the noise of this year and would encourage people to look at that two year stack and push forward the same drivers are there that makes you feel good about our ability to continue to grow gross margin over the long term not only the scaling of the existing initiatives in new ones but really pleased what weve seen with the shrink improvement the supply chain efficiencies a lot of opportunities still around private brands penetration expansion for insourcing expansion. The team continues to do a great job with category management.,DG,0.9994716644287108,0.9989433282275961,Positive
Again when you look at our scale and our growing scale as a limited SKU shop it really puts us in a very favorable position to get best pricing there and protect our margins while also being well priced. And on the price front well always reserve the right to invest as needed. But as we look at now and as weve seen for quite a while now we feel like were in the best position on pricing weve been in and dont see at least the foreseeable future the need to invest there. So we feel good about the longterm ability to continue to grow gross margin while also driving traffic and sales.,DG,0.9997298121452332,0.9994596239683771,Positive
Yeah. Karen I would also just  just say real quick and then get to the next question is that I feel as good about this business than I have the 12 almost 13 years that Ive been here. And the longterm outlook of this business is stronger than ever. And as John indicated I think once we get through the noise of 2021 I believe that algorithm is very much intact. And as you have seen even prior to COVID we were running at the top end of that algorithm and many of the components of it. And theres no reason why that shouldnt continue as we can  as we go long term.,DG,0.8887451887130737,0.7774902447999983,Positive
No I complete  I just want to clarify on the 8400 lost days I get that to be  its about 180 basis points to the comp. Is that fair,DG,0.0163763463497161,-0.9672484798720361,Negative
Well I think the way to  yeah I think the way to look at this is I think we did quantify the impact of the storm on operating profit and a meaningful piece of that was the sales impact. So if you look at the overall dollars we quantified about half of that was sales flow through. So maybe thats the way to dimensionalize that.,DG,0.9997044801712036,0.9994089599901199,Positive
Okay. Great. Thank you.,DG,0.9986599087715148,0.9973198159455154,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.,DG,0.978800356388092,0.9576006875042244,Positive
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess John first starting with guidance. I was curious what your team is assuming for the promotional backdrop. And as your trends have turned negative and a number of other players are also starting to turn negative I was just curious if you have seen any shifts in the promotional backdrop lately,DG,0.8930742144584656,0.7861483014513859,Positive
Yeah. As you look at the promotional backdrop we think it remains rational. Its been that way for the last about a year and half so things have been pretty consistent. And so as we look forward were not assuming any major changes there because we feel like were very well positioned on price. And Todd do you want to add anything,DG,0.9956101179122924,0.9912202305914344,Positive
Yeah Rupesh I would tell you from a position of strength last year weve positioned ourselves to be in the best position in pricing than weve been in many many years. And so if you take a look at our everyday pricing we are better than weve been across all channels of trade. And as John indicated the promotional environment has been pretty stable and tame and quite frankly has been that way for a year and half. So we feel pretty good about where we are but always reserve the right if we need to help our consumer out well do that. But right now we dont see that in the near future.,DG,0.9703324437141418,0.9406648520617795,Positive
Okay. Great. And then maybe just one followup question. So Todd just curious on your latest thoughts on what youre seeing from your consumer base on your service. Because it does appear to us I mean it is a fairly strong consumer out there stimulus is coming. So I just want to get your thoughts there,DG,0.9997220635414124,0.9994441267514984,Positive
Yeah. I would tell you the consumer  our core consumers always stretch as you know but I have to repeat that each time because she really is. And I would tell you that in the last six to eight months shes felt the stress of this pandemic probably a little bit more than she was feeling in the early part of the pandemic. And in some cases because again lack of work or not working that full 40hour shift to that fulltime that she was doing in many cases. So and our core consumer is probably a little bit more stretched at this point.,DG,0.0035307705402374,-0.9929396468041223,Negative
In saying that what we have also seen though is her ability to spend when she needs to and stimulus has really helped that.,DG,0.9292912483215332,0.8585824123516157,Positive
So were in round three and as I indicated its very early on in that third round. Were bullish on her ability to have some extra money to spend. And were also bullish when we think about the back half of the year the child tax credit piece that will be coming out for children from July through December should also benefit our core consumer. And then obviously the extension of the SNAP benefit piece also helps.,DG,0.993791937828064,0.9875838682555367,Positive
So there is a lot of tailwind. We just in our guidance didnt contemplate any of that because again its so  first of all its so new we just dont know how to dimensionalize it. But I think the important thing Rupesh to keep in mind is that were well positioned to capture a large portion of that if shes outspending it.,DG,0.1631064116954803,-0.673788174264535,Negative
And I believe she will spend it. That is who our core consumer is. But as John said there are other  were not as concerned about retail. We believe we will get more than our fair share at retail. Its just some of these other areas that are now open whether it be dining out whether it be travel to some degree that will be competed against. But we still feel good about being able to service her with that extra money.,DG,0.9596534967422484,0.9193069453876883,Positive
Okay great. Thank you for all the color and best of luck for the year.,DG,0.9991748332977296,0.9983496656117832,Positive
Thank you.,DG,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chandni Luthra of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.,DG,0.978800356388092,0.9576006875042244,Positive
Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about these new banners that you spoke of today. And especially with pOpshelf you mentioned doing a storewithinastore concept with signage for both pOpshelf and the Dollar General banner outside.,DG,0.999513864517212,0.999027728454905,Positive
As you think about your core customer what gives you confidence that the customers will not feel an alienation to the core banner with this double signage outside in a storewithinastore concept How do you think about that,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes thats a great question. And I would tell you first of all our core consumer is a little bit of a different consumer than the pOpshelf consumer. But in the areas that were looking to put these storewithinthestore concepts it is a little higher demographic than our core.,DG,0.9985554814338684,0.9971109611457354,Positive
So just to give you some color in these areas the demographics are more in the 50000 to 75000 income range versus our true Dollar General of 35000 to 40000 range somewhere in there. So its not quite the pOpshelf where its 75000plus. But I believe that the crossover theres enough there to entice the consumer to come in.,DG,0.1287868916988372,-0.7424272551699016,Negative
The second piece of it is that we believe that  and weve already proven it with some crosspollination of items within Dollar General that were in pOpshelf and how well they sold within the box of just a true Dollar General without even having any signage up with pOpshelf.,DG,0.8985440731048584,0.797088025264755,Positive
So we know those same items will resonate with even our core consumers. So we believe we can capture both sides of that equation higher end as well as continue to service the lowerend consumer with this new box.,DG,0.9851166605949402,0.9702333034475465,Positive
It is a test right So just keep that in mind. It will be 25 stores this year. But if it works and we believe it will there could be some additional ones that we do in 2022 and many more as we continue to move forward.,DG,0.9721088409423828,0.9442176486358933,Positive
Got it. And my followup is around new customer retention strategy that you mentioned during your third quarter call around  some strategy around basically retaining those new customers. Could you give an update on that as to what youre doing to retain new customers that you gained during this time,DG,0.9993526935577391,0.9987053863438284,Positive
Yes. Thank you. Well we started that retention effort back in September. We thought it was the right time to start launching it because we knew because of the way we were doing it this wasnt a pricing item retention strategy. This was a retention strategy to keep Dollar General top of mind with these newer customers. And when the pandemic starts to wane we would keep  Dollar General would still be in the consideration set.,DG,0.9994782209396362,0.9989564412572629,Positive
So to be able to do that it takes months to be able to instill that piece into the customers mindset. And  so weve been working it hard now for the better part of five months coming on six months. And we believe that weve seen the benefit of that already.,DG,0.8367228507995605,0.6734455069574756,Positive
When we saw the benefits of stimulus start to wane in November and even early December before the second wave came out we were still seeing that repeat customer come into the store.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So that gave us confidence that what we were doing was working. And now even into Q1 as I mentioned earlier were still seeing that core customer  or Im sorry that new customer show up within our stores. Even though the pandemic is starting to wane even a little bit more were still seeing that customer.,DG,0.0550296902656555,-0.8899417459617531,Negative
We will not leave the foot off the accelerator here. We believe that well continue to do everything we can to drive that consumer in. And as John indicated a large part of that comp this year is predicated on retaining a good portion of those consumers which again we believe we have the right to service that consumer based on what weve seen so far.,DG,0.1922315955162048,-0.6155377719031405,Negative
Thank you so much. Good luck.,DG,0.9972044229507446,0.9944088425688997,Positive
Thank you. Were showing time for one final question today. Our last question will be coming from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.,DG,0.965566337108612,0.9311326331690746,Positive
Good morning.,DG,0.97207772731781,0.9441554213496572,Positive
Good morning.,DG,0.97207772731781,0.9441554213496572,Positive
Youve shared a lot today. So thank you for the color. I guess maybe Id be looking for just additional details on where you are on some of your initiatives and what we should be thinking about over the course of the next 12 months. Specifically DG Fresh would love for you to elaborate there in addition to DG GO and other ways that you are just overall kind of attacking to keep market share.,DG,0.9985177516937256,0.9970355016204724,Positive
Hey Paul this is Jeff. Thank you for that question and we are very proud of our accomplishments with DG Fresh. The team has done a fantastic job of accelerating that rollout and the capabilities that its providing for us. So to be in 16000 storesplus is really an accomplishment. And originally as we talked about DG Fresh was all about reducing product costs improving instocks and a broader assortment and weve hit on all three. So that is performing very well.,DG,0.9995559453964232,0.9991118902634919,Positive
The other thing that were excited about is the future and what it can potentially provide for us as we continue to grow. When you think back for a second on the formats that weve also introduced the reason were able to build larger stores with more coolers is really dependent on our strategic planning process that started several years ago and DG Fresh is a certain core to all of that.,DG,0.989387035369873,0.9787740580880988,Positive
And so when you think about the future and our new format prototype that were going to be moving to in the midpart of 2021 DG Fresh is going to play a key role in being able to continue to broaden that assortment for the customer.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then as you look to the future we also believe that DG Fresh plays a key role in unlocking our ability to do produce in over 10000 stores as we look ahead. So DG Fresh again complicated initiative that the team did a phenomenal job of implementing but is going to set us up for the future in a big way.,DG,0.9952293038368224,0.9904586019865285,Positive
On the digital side I would say remember on DG Pickup 17000 storesplus going from pilot to full rollout in less than a year is again a tremendous accomplishment of the team.,DG,0.2483359575271606,-0.5033289809995778,Negative
But I will say we continue to make great progress there and expanding the assortment. Weve optimized our substitution technology. And one thing you got to keep in mind is were providing optionality for this customer. But our store itself is an incredibly convenient proposition.,DG,0.9881129264831544,0.9762258387958045,Positive
And when you combine being five miles within 75 of the population and selfcheckout that weve got in 1600 stores right now the convenience bar continues to rise. But were very pleased with what were seeing so far there.,DG,0.9928863048553468,0.985772601230503,Positive
And then finally I would tell you in terms of engagement with the customer thats the other thing on the digital side shes asking for. And with four million active users and growing we feel real good about what were doing there as well. So two key initiatives that we look to continue to contribute to our future success.,DG,0.999841570854187,0.9996831415195115,Positive
Thank you so much for that color. Just lastly John I appreciate the CapEx and kind of share buyback guidance. Maybe just talk about your approach to cash kind of priorities overall and how to think about that even beyond 2021.,DG,0.9995065927505492,0.9990131849129107,Positive
Yes. Ill start by saying our capital allocation priorities havent changed. And the first priority remains investing in highreturn growth opportunities like new store growth remodels and the strategic initiatives that just provide fantastic returns. Then its still continuing to pay a competitive dividend which we recently increased 16.7. And then its buying back shares with the excess cash and debt capacity.,DG,0.9980772733688354,0.9961545444456008,Positive
But as weve always noted we want to protect our current investment grade credit rating so we keep the leverage ratio around 3. So we bought back this year. I mean were able to do all and buyback 2.5 billion of shares with the extra cash. Next year were targeting 1.8 billion.,DG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then I think also meaningfully what you saw last year is we accelerated virtually every strategic initiative with the extra cash which is again our first priority investing in the business. So that served us very well and remains unchanged.,DG,0.8784602284431458,0.7569203119995069,Positive
Thank you. Best of luck.,DG,0.9966826438903807,0.9933652838261624,Positive
Thank you.,DG,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive

Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on our call today. Each quarter we include a brief overview of the company shown on slide 3 for new investors. Taking a look at the full year fiscal 2020 which ended on October 31st our total revenue grew by double digit to approximately 71 million. Our three largest categories service and licenses advanced technologies and generation represent diversified sources of recurring revenue under multiyear contracts with investment grade customers. Consistent with our strategy in future quarters we expect the work we have done to rebuild our business development and gotomarket capabilities recruit and onboard strategic talent and reenter and build client relationships and target global markets to yield growth including product sales.,FCELB,1.0,1.0,Positive
Consistent with our prior experience in certain markets such as Korea the largest fuel cell market in the world select countries across Europe and other international markets we expect some customers to choose to purchase our platform bundled with longterm service contracts that run coterminous with platforms like should our marketing efforts be successful. We are optimistic about the momentum behind the global energy transition that we expect to be enabled by distributed generation distributed hydrogen long duration hydrogen energy storage and carbon capture. At the top of the slide we highlight many of our customers currently utilizing our multi featured fuel cell platforms. Many of these systems integrate combined heat and power capabilities creating very high energy efficiency levels while others installations form the backbone of micro grids enhancing resiliency and reliability andor utilize biofuel resulting in carbon neutral to carbon negative power.,FCELB,0.9997263550758362,0.999452709825462,Positive
Our platforms also have the ability to leverage multiple fuel types a feature many customers are interested in. In addition our carbonate fuel cell platform has the ability to deliver hydrogen through our Trigen platform. And were developing a new capability of running our carbon and fuel cell in reverse or an electrolysis mode through a process known as Reforming Electrolysis and Purification or REP. We believe that the distributed nature of our hydrogen platform can enable the hydrogen economy in advance of the midstream infrastructure availability. FuelCell Energy offers diversification across fuel cell technologies that enable solutions across multiple applications or jobs that need to be done.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Additionally as I will cover later in my remarks we continue to advance the commercialization of our solid oxide fuel cell platform to produce hydrogen through highly efficient electrolysis long duration hydrogen based energy storage and zero carbon hydrogen power generation. We believe that these technologies can provide the firm capacity required to support intermittent renewable technologies such as wind and solar by converting the off peak energy occasionally generated by renewables or excess energy produced in excess of demand into hydrogen that is stored and later set back to the same FuelCell Energy fuel cell stack to produce zero carbon power. Recently the world watch the disruption and loss of life in Texas that caused by unavailability of power. FuelCell Energy is committed to delivering base load power installation across our carbonate and solid oxide platforms that can and have demonstrated their ability to reduce the likelihood of similar events in the future. We stand ready to support customers around the world.,FCELB,0.999547839164734,0.99909567779045,Positive
Next moving to slide 4 I want to highlight our commitment to our purpose of enabling the world to live a life empowered by clean energy. We believe that all people around the world will increasingly need reliable always on power. The electric grid continues to evolve but grid reliability remains a critical issue. We believe that FuelCell Energy is uniquely positioned to meet the reliability challenges with our broad product portfolio that can also assist with decarbonization goals. We dont subscribe to the notion that decarbonization has to mean deindustrialization or the developing countries around the world cant participate in industrialized society. This purpose drives our strategic focus and the work we do.,FCELB,0.9912906885147096,0.9825813666471046,Positive
Turning now to the quarter I have three overarching messages. The first is that we are continuing to make progress against our 1.27 billion backlog. As we execute our powerhouse business strategy by working differently and thus adds another 40.7 megawatts to our generation portfolio. Subsequent to quarter end with the addition of our new 2.8 megawatt PPA for our second project in Derby Connecticut our backlog has increased to 43.5 megawatts. We have completed the majority of our scope of work on the 7.4 megawatt project at the US Navy base in Groton Connecticut. The company is currently awaiting the interconnection and other safety related work to be completed prior to the commissioning and commercial operations.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The interconnection agreement for this project is a four party agreement and has taken longer than originally estimated to complete. FuelCell Energy looks forward to fortifying the power infrastructure supporting base resiliency and the US Federal Governments defense critical electrical infrastructure objectives. Additionally construction activity has been substantially complete for a 1.4 megawatt project at the San Bernardino California Wastewater Treatment facility that will utilize onside biofuel to produce carbon neutral power. Were working with the local utility on the interconnection process prior to commissioning and commencing commercial operation. I want to provide a more color on interconnection for those less familiar with the process. Essentially prior to being able to operate in parallel with the utility grid network a series of studies such as a feasibility distant impact and distribution studies are required to be performed by the appropriate local utility for distribution level interconnects or in some cases by the regional transmission organization for larger or grid connected projects.,FCELB,0.0016917884349822,-0.9966176132068715,Negative
Before distributed electrical generation equipment is approved for connection to or operation in parallel with the grid which is a requirement for commercial operation. These studies assess the addition of the power generation platform and its impact on the existing utility power system as well as identify any interconnection facilities or network upgrades needed for interconnecting the platform to the utility grid. The lead time for this process can vary depending on a variety of factors including the utilities ability to prioritize the studies the technical complexity of the project site and infrastructure work required by the utility prior to interconnection. We proactively manage every aspect of the interconnection process within our scope and responsibility to obtain interconnection as quickly as possible while ensuring compliance with all safety and reliability requirements.,FCELB,0.7768352031707764,0.5536701403082254,Positive
As noted in the case of Groton this work is being managed by a third party. We have also commenced construction on 24.5 megawatts of projects including the 2.3 megawatt Trigen hydrogen platform that will deliver carbon neutral electricity green hydrogen and produce water to Toyota at the Port of Long Beach. We believe our Trigen hydrogen platform is the only platform in the world that produces hydrogen and usable water in a single distributed platform. In addition we are advancing our utility scale deployments in Yaphank Long Island New York and Derby Connecticut. We were able to resume manufacturing with necessary safety enhancements at our Torrington Connecticut manufacturing facility in June of 2020. And we have established a phased and return to work schedule for those employees that have been working from home through this month.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We continue to evaluate our ability to operate in light of recent resurgence of COVID19 and the advisability of continuing operations based on federal state and local jurisdiction requirements around the world evolving data concerning the pandemic the availability of vaccines and the best interest of our employees customers and shareholders. The second key message I want to highlight is the progress weve made toward bolstering our financial foundation strengthening our liquidity and creating an opportunity to reduce our cost of capital. As we have previously disclosed during the quarter we completed an additional equity offering resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately 156 million. And third I want to reiterate our goal of strengthening our leadership and sustainability and environmental stewardship. Customers around the world are increasingly looking for authentic onsite and sustainable decarbonize energy solutions to address climate challenges enhance grid reliability and enable them to continue to operate their businesses without intermittent disruptions. To meet the growing global need for clean decarbonized energy FuelCell Energy remains focused on developing and deploying our product portfolio solutions for some of the largest global energy opportunities.,FCELB,0.9623191356658936,0.9246382264126696,Positive
A recent technology milestone has been the commencement of operation and testing of our prototype SOEC or Solid Oxide Electrolysis platform in Danbury Connecticut. Today the platform has successfully and efficiently converting electricity and water into hydrogen. We also intend to continue to strengthen our leadership position in distributed generation distributed hydrogen and carbon capture.,FCELB,0.971787929534912,0.9435758254383952,Positive
And now I will turn the call over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mike,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Jason. Lets begin by reviewing financial highlights for the quarter shown on slide 7. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 we delivered 14.9 million in total revenue a 9 decline compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The primary driver of the decrease was that the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 included 4 million of nonrecurring license revenues associated with our Joint Development Agreement or JDA with ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company or EMRE related to carbon capture technology development.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Looking at revenue drivers by category Service and License revenues decreased 12 to 4.9 million from 5.6 million in the prior year period. Revenue recognized in the first quarter primarily includes revenue recorded for module replacements and routine maintenance activities. Whereas revenue recognized in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 included nonrecurring license revenues of 4 million associated with our JDA with EMRE and 1.6 million associated with routine monitoring and maintenance activities for projects under service agreements. Generation revenues decreased 10 to 4.9 million due to a temporary shutdown of several of the individual plants at the Bridgeport fuel cell project for scheduled module exchanges in the quarter. Advanced Technology contract revenues decrease 3 to 5.1 million from 5.2 million. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 Advanced Technology contract revenues recognized under the JDA with EMRE were approximately 300000 higher during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 reflecting continued advancement of our joint research with EMRE on fuel cell carbon capture solutions during the quarter.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The increased revenues under the JDA were offset by 400000 of less revenue recognized under government contracts in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2020. Gross loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 total 3.6 million compared to a gross profit of 3.3 million in the prior year quarter. Results for the quarter of fiscal year 2021 reflected no license revenues under the JDA during the quarter as well as a temporary shutdown of several of the individual plants at the Bridgeport fuel cell project for module exchanges during the quarter and higher manufacturing variances and service related costs compared to the prior year period.,FCELB,0.8544222116470337,0.7088442497517167,Positive
Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 increased to 10.8 million from 6.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Administrative and selling expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 included additional stock based compensation expense of 800000 tied to grants made in 2020 and an increase in the value of the deferred director compensation liability due to the increase in the companys share price. The first quarter of fiscal year 2020 included a legal settlement of 2.2 million which was recorded as an offset to administrative and selling expenses.,FCELB,0.91884446144104,0.8376888261370814,Positive
Research and Development expenses of 1.8 million during the quarter reflected increased spending on the companys hydrogen commercialization initiatives. Loss from operations totaled 14.4 million compared to 3.1 million in the prior year period. Net loss for the quarter totaled 46 million compared to a net loss of 40.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the quarter totaled 46.8 million or 0.15 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of 41.1 million or 0.20 per basic and diluted share in the comparable prior year period.,FCELB,0.0005684196949005,-0.9988643520261956,Negative
The lower net loss per common share despite a higher net loss attributable to common stockholders is due to the higher weighted average shares outstanding from share issuances since January 31 2020. The net loss per share in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 includes the change in fair value liability associated with the warrants issued to lenders under our now extinguished credit agreement with Orion Energy Partners of 16 million accounting for approximately a 0.05 per share impact on the reported net loss per share compared to 34.2 million or 0.17 per share in the comparable prior year period. The net loss per share attributable common shareholders in the quarter ended January 31 2021 also included a loss on the extinguishment of debt and the loss and extinguishment of preferred stock obligation of subsidiary together totaling 12.1 million or a 0.04 per share impact on the reported net loss per share.,FCELB,0.0021432340145111,-0.9957147215096482,Negative
Adjusted EBITDA totaled negative 7.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative 200000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Please see the discussion of nonGAAP financial measures including adjusted EBITDA in the appendix of our earnings release. Prior to leaving the slide I would know that the pictures on the right showcase the progress that weve made on the 7.4 megawatt platform at the Navy sub base in Groton Connecticut.,FCELB,0.9798449277877808,0.9596898315488289,Positive
Next please turn to slide 9 for additional detail on financial performance and our backlog. The chart on the left hand side of the slide graphically displays the numbers I walked through for the first quarters of fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Looking at the right side of the slide we finished the quarter with backlog of approximately 1.27 billion a decrease of 7 subsequent to the end of the quarter the company entered into a 20 year Power Purchase Agreement or PPA with a Lime United Illuminating for a 2.8 megawatt project in Derby Connecticut awarded as part of the competitively bid state sponsored shared clean energy facility program. This platform will supply 2.8 megawatts of clean base load power to the Connecticut electric grid enhancing resilience and is our second project located in Derby.,FCELB,0.9990344643592834,0.998068927567558,Positive
This contract is not included in the companys backlog as of January 31 2021 but is expected to add 59.4 million in future revenue to the companys reported generation backlog going forward.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to slide 9 I would like to highlight the steps taken as part of our powerhouse business strategy to provide additional liquidity with the goal of enabling us to focus on the execution of our business plan. including building out our backlog of generation projects commercializing our advanced hydrogen technologies and expanding our gotomarket activities. As of January 31 2021 cash restricted cash and cash equivalents totaled 209.6 million of which 31 million was restricted cash and cash equivalents represented by the green bars. During the quarter we completed an equity offering resulting in the net proceeds to the company of approximately 156.4 million. This offering allowed us to extinguish our senior secured credit facility with Orion Energy Partners and to pay off the Series 1 Preferred Share obligation that one of our subsidiaries owed to Enbridge Inc.,FCELB,0.7698003053665161,0.5396003363134481,Positive
The net proceeds from the offering may also be used to accelerate the development and commercialization of our solid oxide platform and for project development project financing working capital support and general corporate purposes. In addition our improved capital structure provides for lower interest expense the elimination of the Series 1 Preferred dividends and increased flexibility of project financing. On the right side of the slide we have included a chart illustrating our total project assets which make up for our company owned generation portfolio. Investments today include capital spent towards completed projects as well as inside development projects.,FCELB,0.9999938011169434,0.9999876022264971,Positive
As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 our gross project assets totaled 197.5 million. As itemized on slide 21 in the appendix of this presentation our generation portfolio totaled 73.3 megawatts of assets as of January 31 2021. As projects in development come online such as the Groton 7.4 megawatt platform that I previously highlighted they are expected to contribute higher revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Higher revenue and positive adjusted EBITDA are two aspects of our goals described on slide 16 in this presentation. Also as projects become operational we expect to execute longterm financing at efficient cost of capital thus recycling cash back to the company to redeploy into other projects or growth development activities.,FCELB,0.9790831804275512,0.9581663359202954,Positive
In closing we are pleased with the progress that weve made under our powerhouse business strategy. We have a strengthened financial foundation allowing us to focus on driving commercial availability of our advanced technology solutions including distributed hydrogen electrolysis and hydrogen production and long duration energy storage and to focus on expanding our geographic markets while also executing on our plans to deliver on our project backlog.,FCELB,0.9948201179504396,0.9896402297259748,Positive
I will now turn the call back over to Jason.,FCELB,0.8493170142173767,0.6986338488065296,Positive
Thanks Mike. As mentioned previously we are near completion of two new power platforms one at the US Navy base in Groton Connecticut and one zero carbon biofuel platforms at the wastewater treatment facility in San Bernardino California. Our SureSource 1500 and SureSource 3000 power platforms are the only fuel cell systems certified to carbon emission standards under the distributed generation certification program for operations with onsite bio gas. We also began early stage construction of 24.5 megawatts of projects including the Toyota Hydrogen project at the Port of Long Beach and utility scale projects in Yaphank on Long Island in New York and Derby Connecticut.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We are also advancing the development of new technologies including operating and testing a prototype solid oxide electrolysis hydrogen platform in Danbury Connecticut and continuing to advance our joint research with EMRE on fuel cell carbon capture solutions.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to slide 11 I want to take a moment to highlight the strong resiliency characteristics of our shore source platform. As I mentioned earlier recent headlines in Texas surrounding extreme weather as well as continued challenges for grid reliability in markets such as California or the extreme freeze in Greece in the UK in February continue to expose the inherent challenges of a long distance transmission based grid. In cities across America governments and utilities alike are hopeful any infrastructure package contemplated by Congress in the new administration will include funding to upgrade todays grid with reliable distributed megawatt scale power platforms. Our platforms not only run 24x7x365 but have demonstrated their performance stability during some of natures more extreme conditions. Highlighted on the chart to the left are numerous examples where our shore source platforms operated seamlessly and prolonged instances of extreme temperatures providing universities industry credible resources and the broader utility grid with reliable power,FCELB,0.9993574023246764,0.9987148038833162,Positive
On the right is an example of one of these installations a shore source 3000 located on the campus of the University of California San Diego as part of a micro grid solution it helps provide energy security to more than 40000 students on its approximate 1000 acre campus. And beyond power the University uses the thermal attributes of our platform with a heat exchanger being used to drive absorption chiller to provide cold water to the campus. This installation along with our micro grids installed at the jail in Santa Rita California are highlighted by the magazine micro grid knowledge as being two World Class examples of micro grids that deliver on their promise of always on power having continued to provide power during public safety power shut offs in their respective areas.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
On slide 12 I want to again remind everyone of the four major market opportunities that FuelCell Energy is pursuing. Distributed generation distributed hydrogen and long duration storage and carbon capture. We believe that each of these has a very large total addressable market opportunity for which we are working to position the company to benefit. We continue to advance research and development of our carbonate fuel cell platforms efficiency capturing carbon from an external source while also producing power. Our proprietary carbon capture solution is the only solution that we know of that captures carbon from an external source and produces power rather than consuming it and is also capable of producing hydrogen for distributed applications. We also can directly capture carbon from our own shore source power platform for carbon utilization andor sequestration.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I also want to take this opportunity to spend more time on our hydrogen focus including technology in the process of being tested and advanced for commercialization.,FCELB,0.8634994029998779,0.7269986432782669,Positive
So turning to slide 13 you will see a visual illustration of how FuelCell Energy will deliver hydrogen across three of our platforms. Our carbonate platform featured on the right side of this line allows us to deliver hydrogen through our Trigen hydrogen platform. The first half of the word Trigen is important because the platform delivers three value streams to our customers. First it delivers power. Second it produces hydrogen and third it actually produces water while delivering hydrogen. Adding more value in areas where water for electrolysis is at a premium which as previously stated we believe makes it the only platform in the world that produces water and hydrogen.,FCELB,0.9990215301513672,0.9980430591363068,Positive
The Trigen platform can deliver green blue and grey hydrogen. Were in the process of building the first commercial installation of this platform for Toyota at the Port of Long Beach today. When the coproduction of power is not required our carbonate platform is being developed to produce green blue or grey hydrogen through a reformer electrolyzer purifier process RREP. Our solid oxide technology pictured here on the left side of this slide which we are advancing to commercialization is designed to produce green blue and grey hydrogen through highly efficient high temperature electrolysis. In addition to our solid oxide fuel cell being designed to be highly efficient operating at a high temperature and having the ability to leverage waste to achieve even higher efficiency it is designed to operate in reverse mode.,FCELB,0.8477559089660645,0.6955116364429215,Positive
The same platform stack used to convert electricity and water into hydrogen is reversible solid oxide mode will produce zero carbon power using the stored hydrogen. So one might ask why three platforms The answer is simple. Customers want to accomplish different objectives and need to get different jobs done. Each location will have a unique pricing environment for fuel and electricity. In markets with higher power prices our Trigen platform might be the best solution if you can sell the electricity into the grid at higher prices which reduces the cost of the produced hydrogen or perhaps local water is in scarce supply or is at a premium.,FCELB,0.9990381598472596,0.9980763185479158,Positive
We expect our developing REP platform to work well across various fuel and electric price environments and in environments where selling power to the grid is not an option. And it should be uniquely situated to carbon capture applications to produce blue hydrogen. With our solid oxide platforms high efficiency design and expectation to leverage waste it is expected to be well suited for low energy price environments and environments with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources. The breadth and depth of our developing technology portfolio positioned FuelCell Energy to deliver distributed hydrogen across several environments around the world. The flexibility we expect to provide around distributed platform source and price of hydrogen will enable us to add value in almost all energy segments globally.,FCELB,0.996436357498169,0.9928727107481425,Positive
The versatility of our developing platform configurations allow FuelCell Energy to serve transportation industrial natural gas decarbonization and substitution repowering existing power infrastructure and serving as a stationary power generation source and other processes not suited for electrification.,FCELB,0.0605937540531158,-0.8788136117539477,Negative
Slide 14 provides a more detailed overview of our solid oxide platform. The prototype unit pictured here is a system currently operating in our Danbury Connecticut headquarters for testing of various platform design elements. This year we will build a larger version of this solid oxide electrolysis fuel cell for delivery to the Idaho National Labs under a cooperative funding agreement with the US Department of Energy. The deal we project will incorporate a multi stack electrolysis system utilizing our solid oxide technology. The system will also be equipped with an option to receive thermal energy thus expected to increase the electrolysis electrical efficiency from about 90 to approximately 100. Following the design manufacture and testing of the system at FuelCell Energy facilities the electrolysis system will be delivered to Idaho National Laboratories where it will undergo rigorous testing to confirm the electrical efficiency as well as the ability to utilize nuclear power plant waste to obtain higher efficiencies of up to 100.,FCELB,0.9973363876342772,0.9946727720932791,Positive
This project represents a key step in FuelCell Energys path to commercialize our high temperature high efficiency solid oxide electrolysis technology. The multi stack module that forms the core of the system is a modular building block easily scalable for larger systems we believe up to gigawatt scale.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
On slide 15 next I want to briefly review our powerhouse business strategy which is based on the three core pillars of transform strengthening grow. When we introduced the powerhouse business strategy we provided our plan to reposition FuelCell Energy to capitalize on the energy transition. The powerhouse business strategy serves as the guideposts for the turnaround we are architecting at FuelCell Energy. Like with most turnarounds it takes time we are approximately 15 months in our journey and we are pleased with our progress today. The first phase of our plan was to transform the company to build a durable financial foundation and enhanced financial results. We have taken a number of important steps to strengthen the balance sheet allowing us to finance completion of new projects and lower cost of capital.,FCELB,0.9998837113380432,0.9997674225374595,Positive
Currently we are focused on strengthening stage of our strategy by driving operational excellence throughout the business and making capital investment decisions that further enhance our performance and advanced product commercialization. And our third pillar to fully deliver on the powerhouse business strategy we outlined is achieving growth over the long term by seeking to penetrate markets and customer segments where our technology platforms can be the preferred solution. Our production operations are well positioned for further capacity expansion and will generate operating leverage as we ramp our production rate in support of future business growth. And support of our growth goal to achieve geographic market expansion including Europe FuelCell Energy has announced it is joined Hydrogen Europe the leading European Association representing the interest of the hydrogen and FuelCell Energy and its stakeholders reinforcing our commitment to the European market and providing a platform for European customers to better understand the value of our broad platform portfolio.,FCELB,0.9999991655349731,0.9999983310689515,Positive
Were proud to join a community of companies working to significantly advance and accelerate the hydrogen economy. While we are headquartered in the US we operate a manufacturing and service center in Germany that services the broader European market.,FCELB,0.1413660049438476,-0.7172690136844002,Negative
Turning to slide 16 we will continue to work toward our longterm targets and goals that we established with the launch of our powerhouse business strategy looking ahead to fiscal year 2022. Reaching these targets to require successfully executing against our approximately 41 megawatt project backlog and advancing commercial operations for each of those projects which are expected to deliver recurring revenue through power generation and longterm service agreements. As I have explained in todays presentation we are pursuing commercialization of our advanced technologies around REP in solid oxide hydrogen and extending our carbon capture platform for solutions for capturing carbon from external sources and internally from the fuel cell each of which offers potential growth opportunities for our company.,FCELB,0.9994227886199952,0.9988455765519004,Positive
I will conclude my remarks today by reviewing key investment highlights for FuelCell Energy on slide 17. We have executed several strategic actions that strengthen our balance sheet by repaying debt enhancing liquidity and reducing our cost of borrowing which we believe positions the company to execute on our growth strategy. We have a strong multi discipline team across our company that is focused on taking care of our customers achieving financial milestones executing on our backlog winning new business globally advancing commercialization of our differentiated platform solutions driving down the total cost of customer ownership and continually building upon our operational excellence while adhering to our core purpose.,FCELB,0.9997172355651855,0.9994344707932894,Positive
We possess a portfolio of innovative technologies that contribute to the global goals of decarbonizing the grid developing the hydrogen economy and supporting existing energy and industrial infrastructure investment with a set of differentiated carbon capture solutions. Were working to implement our powerhouse strategy to strengthen our business maximize operational efficiencies and position us for longterm growth. We appreciate many of you who track our progress and look for mile markers that illuminate the progress were making toward the achievement of our powerhouse business strategy. As I previously stated were just 15 months into our power hour strategy and we believe we are on track. The breadth of our portfolio and the ability to apply our technology against a wider set of applications provides FuelCell Energy with greater optionality to shift focus towards 81 of our four energy transition focus areas based on the pace of market adoption thus increasing diversification.,FCELB,0.9997760653495787,0.9995521304322064,Positive
Finally we intend to be a leader in sustainability and environmental stewardship by delivering on sustainability through our technology and the full circular life of our platforms. We look forward to the year ahead.,FCELB,0.9666306376457214,0.9332612355120393,Positive

Good morning guys. I was wondering if you could flesh out a little bit more detail on the solid oxide electrolysis opportunity that youre testing and Danbury I wasnt sure what the next steps are and then how we think about the timeline to commercialization. And when you can start participating in REPs for that  fully recognized there are some incremental steps that need to be taken from here but I was just wondering if we could sort of book in that and how long it will take.,FCELB,0.999976396560669,0.9999527930932004,Positive

Hey Jeff great good to have you on the call today and thanks for joining. Great question. Maybe Ill start and then Ill ask Tony Leo our Chief Technology Officer to also chime in. So with this test we will lead to the next phase of actually executing the test with INL will be the next phase of our process to get to commercialization. But as we think about the opportunity to your question of participate in REPs given where we are and where some of these REPs or at least projects that people are talking about are kind of longer dated projects we will participate in some of those opportunities if those timelines fit our internal projections about when our product will be commercial. But Tony if you have anything else to add there for the phases,FCELB,0.9999985098838806,0.9999970197659849,Positive

Can you characterize the amount that your bidding activity has changed over the last three or six months And what your kind of bandwidth for new project sales like what would be kind of the points that we can say youre stretching your limits,FCELB,0.9946920275688172,0.9893840488100345,Positive
JasonFew,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Laurence good morning. How are you Thanks for joining the call this morning. If bidding activity if you mean by that the amount of activity were participating in terms of proposals or submitting proposals or responding REPs I would say over the last six months it has increased fairly significantly for us. I mean the sales cycle generally given our megawatt class platforms generally take between 12 to 18 months as a sales cycle. But weve seen a lot of increase activity not only here domestically but in the international markets that were focused on. And so were as I think about it and look at the pipeline and as we go through our phases in the pipeline from engaging a customer ultimately to submitting a proposal. I think were making a lot of progress there. And I feel good about the pipeline. And I feel good about the number of opportunities we have in the proposal phase.,FCELB,0.9999974966049194,0.9999949932068546,Positive
With respect to the number of projects that we could pursue we  if you think about what we do in terms of our carbonate platform as we talked about and maybe Mike Lisowski speak to a little bit in terms of how were ramping our manufacturing capacity to meet the demand that we see. But the things that were doing in regards to some of our European opportunities we have our facility in Germany which also gives us some capacity. And then the work that were doing on solid oxide that work is done between our facility in Calgary and our facility here in Danbury so those projects arent really competing against our capabilities to produce our carbonate platform and meet the opportunities that weve responded to from an REP or proposal standpoint. Mike do you want to Indiscernible where we are in terms of production.,FCELB,0.9999304413795472,0.9998608826761741,Positive

So relative to support a backlog and future business growth were really well positioned holistically across the business both from a supply chain perspective and continuity and supply of materials from a labor and talent position as well as production capacity. And weve been working very hard across our teams and thoughtfully adding strategic capacity in locations across our factory where theyre needed working to establish enhanced yield and continue to expand at throughput. So were feeling very confident about where were positioned today and where were headed for future business growth.,FCELB,1.0,1.0,Positive

Thanks so much guys. And well done on getting the balance sheet restructured. It sounds like youve got a number of important technology programs underway. And even with the partnerships it looks like you may need to be spending a bit more on RD. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that spend is expected to trend and the skills that you might need to add to the team,FCELB,0.9999922513961792,0.9999845027831213,Positive

Yes Colin good morning. Thank you. Ill ask Mike bishop to comment on that with respect to the increased capital that were putting toward RD to support commercialization of these technologies. And from a Ill just maybe speak to the skill set and maybe Tony could add to as well. We feel really good about the technical resources we have on our team across engineering to support our RD efforts. And thats inclusive of the work that were doing with respect to carbon capture with EMRE from Exxon the Exxon Research effort that we have going on. But Mike you want to talk a little bit about how were allocating additional capital.,FCELB,0.9999994039535522,0.999998807906394,Positive
MikeBishop,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Good morning Colin. Thanks for joining the call. So what we put out there when we put our 10K out was we do expect to see higher on the OpEx side we do expect to see higher RD spending around distributed hydrogen hydrogen and long duration hydrogen storage. Last year we reported about 4.8 million of RD expense. Were forecasting between 18 million to 20 million of RD expense from a CapEx perspective this year and adding manufacturing equipment and lab equipment were forecasted to be in the range of 5 million to 10 million of CapEx.,FCELB,0.991127610206604,0.982255209836489,Positive

All right thats super helpful and then just a follow up as you build up the project pipeline. Theres been a tight labor market weve seen an increased commodity prices could you just talk a little bit about any potential extension on timelines to completing construction and any sort of CapEx adjustments that you might need to make given some of those labor and commodity prices,FCELB,0.9883533120155334,0.9767066101471247,Positive

Colin were not seeing any impact from a labor standpoint relative to the construction side of our in flight projects. And were not really forecasting an impact there its something we continue to monitor. Mike Lisowski is on top of that manages that very very tightly. We also arent seeing any impacts in terms of material supply to the company and our ability to manufacture product in order to meet the demand that we have for in flight projects. So were not having that experience today as a company.,FCELB,0.0035514533519744,-0.9928982811559924,Negative

Hi yes. Question follows up so I guess my question if I look at the maybe this is a Tony or Jason question. So if I look at the Trigen in adding the capture how should we think about this in terms of reduction of efficiency by adding that additional capture methodology in that to go from grey to blue,FCELB,0.9022430181503296,0.8044859197651861,Positive
JasonFew,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So if you think about Trigen if you count the energy value that hydrogen reproduces our efficiency actually goes up. Its quite high. Now if you add and of course for our Long Beach project were using directed bio gas. So thats zero carbon to begin with. If youre using natural gas and add carbon capture you will probably  youll obviously youll have to power that carbon capture equipment to some extent. So our 2.8 megawatt system in Trigen mode is 2.3 megawatts you would probably go down to something like 2.1 with carbon capture.,FCELB,0.9992493987083436,0.9984987965219003,Positive

Great. And just as a follow up on operationally I guess Im assuming that theres a point in terms of showing the progress and highlighting the Groton sub base which seems like its progressing nicely. So congrats on that. I guess I just want to understand the conversion from backlog into the recognition of those revenues and kind of that switch into the portfolio. So maybe if you could just and maybe I missed it but if you could articulate time expectations in terms of what needs to occur for completion and rev rec on that project. That would be helpful.

So maybe Ill start and then Mike Lisowski Mike Bishop can chime in just in terms of where we are in the process. Like I indicated in my remarks we are materially complete with our portion of the work though with exception of getting the interconnection done and some other safety work that has to happen. So we havent given an exact date simply because the interconnection agreement like I indicated is being managed by a third party. But maybe Ill ask Mike Lisowski to speak to that a little bit. But then from the point of getting interconnect and us going COD is when we would start to generate revenue from that asset for the company. But Mike do you want to talk about,FCELB,0.856968879699707,0.71393758889293,Positive
MikeLisowski,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes Jed thank you for your question just to provide a little bit more color around the project. Yes despite some challenges Im really proud of the team and all the progress thats been realized in reaching our current advanced stage of project execution at the Groton site. As Jason has mentioned all of the sites civil construction has been completed all of the required equipment and materials have been fabricated and delivered to the site. All the mechanical assembly construction is complete at this point with the majority of the electrical installation completed as well. Right now were in the process of discrete equipment checkout and safety related work as part of the commissioning process. And once we complete that plant commissioning process well be well positioned to export power once interconnect is executed and finalized. And as Jason mentioned thats the point at which it would convert into revenue generating assets.,FCELB,0.9987416863441468,0.997483371188266,Positive
MikeBishop,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And Jed this is Mike Bishop. Ill add one more point on the revenue side. And as I tried to highlight in my comments our generation portfolio is the biggest portion of our revenue backlog. Its about 1.1 billion. Today we have operating about 30 megawatts of operating assets and as we said in our remarks were in the process of building out another 40 plus megawatts of assets. So if you think about that operating portfolio last year we generated about 20 million of annualized revenue. Well were more than doubling the operating portfolio here over the next period of time as these projects come online so theyll begin to make meaningful contributions to increasing our generation revenue as they come online.,FCELB,0.079106718301773,-0.841787661187447,Negative

Hey good morning. I was thinking back to the Exxon JV. And Exxon in their Investor Day a couple of weeks ago talked a good bit about how central carbon capture was to their various green initiatives. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about in the event there there are new technologies that you arent directly involved in introducing to the JV and for instance on their call they mentioned some progress with material technology as far as carbon capture from a gas stream. And I just wonder are those sorts of things do you have some access to those or is there some provision in your agreement where you would be able to get access to other things that they in the course of the JV,FCELB,0.9999929070472716,0.9999858140860878,Positive
JasonFew,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. So good morning. Let me try to start that. And then Ill ask Tony maybe to chime in. So as a company we are an as the joint development agreement to that we have in place with Exxon is very focused on our carbonate fuel cell technology. And whats compelling about the carbonate fuel cell technology are some of the things I mentioned in my comments that its the only platform that were aware of that has the ability to capture carbon from an external source produce more power at the same time and deliver hydrogen from that same platform. That is the focus of our work with Exxon and we believe that those differentiating attributes creates a very compelling proposition for Exxon and for carbon capture overall. And Exxon has a research organization inside their company and they look at various technologies but were very focused on optimizing our carbonate technology to deliver against that.,FCELB,0.9999909996986388,0.9999819993865484,Positive
And look we also support the notion that in order to achieve the global sustainability goals right carbon capture has to be a part of that. And that the goal of reducing carbon or overall climate sustainability goals should not be deindustrialization. And if deindustrialization is not one of the goals which I dont think it is then that means carbon capture has to be an important part of the solution. In addition to doing things like fuel substitution like Hydrogen for example. And so we think were well positioned to participate in all of those. And then Tony I dont know if you have any additional comment relative to other technologies that Exxon is working on but that would not relate to us.,FCELB,0.9996759295463562,0.9993518587063901,Positive
TonyLeo,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes I mean theyre for example theyre looking at direct air capture that is a carbon capture approach that is trying to solve a different problem than the problem of capturing co2 from the fuel gas or boilers or power plants. So theyve got a comprehensive approach a lot of the stuff theyre doing has no bearing on us whatsoever. And as Jason said were very focused on our particular approach to carbon capture which Exxon obviously are interested in.,FCELB,0.9569941759109496,0.9139883005549312,Positive
JasonFew,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And I would just say if you look at other technologies for example just take direct air capture right Again one of the significant differences we have versus direct air capture direct air capture requires a lot of power to operate that technology whereas were additive to the power as opposed to being a parasitic on the power output.,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Good morning. Its Aaron Spychalla on for Eric thanks for taking the questions. Hello first on the generation segment. Mike I think you talked about a little bit on the module exchanges can you just give us an update on kind of the margin outlook there is it still 50 plus as we start to move some of these projects into that bucket And then maybe just an update on extending the stack life there as well.,FCELB,0.9999090433120728,0.9998180865157167,Positive
MikeBishop,FCELB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure. Good morning Aaron. Yes so maybe Ill take the last one first so the company has talked over the last several years about evolving the module life from five years to seven years. So any module exchange that we now do in the fleet has a seven year life and obviously extending stack life is a key tenet of our RD activities. Specific to the generation portfolio and what I mentioned on Bridgeport Bridgeport is a 15 megawatt projects multiple plants at Bridgeport. So over the last couple of quarters we have been doing module exchanges there with the goal of obviously extending life as I just mentioned but also increasing output. You would expect as we go through these to see higher revenue coming from that project. Specific to EBITDA we have said externally that we do target EBITDA margins from our overall generation portfolio in the 50 range.,FCELB,0.9999969005584716,0.9999938011132483,Positive
We have been below that the last couple of quarters the EBITDA up percentage I believe last quarter was in the 31 range this quarter its higher in the 44 range. And obviously with higher revenue and improved operating performance we would expect that to increase over time.,FCELB,0.7778618931770325,0.5557235215446481,Positive

Hi good morning. Thank you for joining our discussion with Lance Fritz the Chairman President and CEO of Union Pacific. We also have Brad Stock EVP of Investor Relations here. Im Brian Ossenbeck I cover transports and logistics for JPMorgan. Were very happy to have Lance here to continue our morning rail session. Hes going to start off with few slides and then were going to QA. If you have questions feel free to submit them through the conference website. Ill take a look at those as they come in and try to work them into the conversation as we go along.,UNP,1.0,1.0,Positive

Thank you Brian. And its a pleasure to be here with you this morning. Ive got a few slides that accompany my prepared comments this morning. Theyre going to be shown on this video chat that you can also see them on our investor website next to the webcast for this event. Before we start I want to remind you that Ill be making some forwardlooking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties. So please refer to the UP website and our SEC filings for additional information about our risk factors.,UNP,0.999994695186615,0.9999893903669062,Positive
So lets begin on Slide 3. 2021 presents a fantastic opportunity for Union Pacific to leverage our service and efficiency improvements over the past two years and win in the marketplace. And improving economy only bolsters the opportunities that are best in industry franchise provides. While our business was impacted in February by large scale weather events that doesnt change our longterm optimism improving GDP and industrial production forecasts as well as continued strength in consumer spending and housing starts builds confidence in a strengthening economy. The recent signing of the COVID relief package should further boost that recover. And while rising fuel prices are impacting our expenses there could ultimately be a positive trade off when you consider truck competition.,UNP,0.9999604225158693,0.9999208449845585,Positive
Turning to Slide 4 February was a challenging month for our network. Heavy snow in the Pacific Northwest snow and Arctic temperatures across the Midwest and snow and ice across Texas Arkansas and Louisiana had significant impact on our operations and that of our customers. The South in particular is not accustomed to the weather theyve faced. This picture on Slide 4 that shows our Houstons Englewood Yard covered in snow is still very difficult for us to fathom.,UNP,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
But thankfully our network has recovered quickly and were able to mitigate the impact to our service. As the chart on the slide demonstrates our freight car velocity is rebounding and we are currently running in somewhere around 217 daily miles per car. Its especially encouraging given how quickly weve also seen our volumes recover with current sevenday carloadings running a bit over 155000 sevenday. Our entire operating department should be commended for the excellent work they perform in navigating this situation. The operational transformation that weve achieved through Precision Scheduled Railroading was demonstrated again in our network resiliency.,UNP,0.9994561672210692,0.9989123337938388,Positive
Turning to Slide 5 with a couple of weeks left in the quarter first quarter volumes are down 4 overall. Weve made up some ground over the last couple of weeks and the trajectory of our volumes is positive. Our premium business is up 3 in the quarter driven by continued strength in intermodal due to ecommerce and restocking. And the typical March volume drop from the Lunar New Year has been muted compared to prior years. Business wins in the area helped fuel the strength as well. However within our premium line automotive continues to be challenged by the impact of the semiconductor chip shortage.,UNP,0.8032177090644836,0.6064351835460564,Positive
Our expectation is that production will be recovered through the course of the year. While our both businesses down 4 reflecting the impact of the weather event strength in export grain remains. Grain and grain products is up 14 but coal being down 17 offsets that growth. Even prior to this storm impact our industrial volumes were down yearoveryear as a result of energyrelated declines. Strengthened forced products driven by that strong housing market remains an area of growth in the quarter.,UNP,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The impact from Texas storm continues to affect our industrial chemicals and plastics business as the majority of the overall top line impact from the event lies within that business group. Were working with those customers to support their recovery and are ready to serve them.,UNP,0.2093413472175598,-0.5813182481040049,Negative
Turning to Slide 6 in early February we announced that our Science Based Targets reduced greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement were approved by SBTi. Our target is to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 26 against the 2018 base by 2030. This is a very important step for Union Pacific in our sustainability journey.,UNP,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Additionally for many years now weve participated in the carbon disclosure project. Were excited to announce that we received the grade of A in climate disclosure demonstrating our leadership in that area. Additionally we received a supplier engagement rating of A indicating were effectively engaging our suppliers on climate change. Union Pacific firmly understands the role we need to play in the fight against climate change and we are committed to being a leader.,UNP,0.9960318207740784,0.9920636368177156,Positive
Turning to Slide 7 we entered the first quarter 2021 recognizing some yearoveryear challenges related to business mix and fuel surcharge revenue but with an expectation to grow volumes. Unfortunately the weather impact I just discussed which reflected both our revenue and expenses added another degree of difficult.,UNP,0.1652055382728576,-0.669589918607425,Negative
Additionally fuel prices have risen in the quarter providing an additional headwind. For example were currently paying about a 1.90 a gallon. While our fuel surcharge programs will ultimately cover this increase we do have about a two month lag. So while our full year guidance is unchanged the impact of weather and fuel in the first quarter will prevent us from making yearoveryear operating ratio improvement an improving economic outlook strong volumes across a number of key areas and our expectations for productivity going forward provide us confidence in the full year.,UNP,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Finally our Virtual Investor Day will take place on May 4 with more details to come. Were excited to lay out our strategy to drive longterm value for all of our stakeholders.,UNP,0.9987502098083496,0.9975004181268323,Positive

Q  Brian Ossenbeck,UNP,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
All right. Great. Thank you Lance for the rundown there. Just to focus on the shortterm for many here you mentioned ORs not going to improve. In the first quarter I think you already previously said that it was  chance is going to deteriorate yearoveryear. So was the change from obviously whats happening between now last time we spoke but what was the main change the weather impact and seeing snow in Houston or were there some other end markets that maybe werent coming up to speed as what you thought you mentioned coal but clearly that was going to be challenged from the beginning of the year. So,UNP,0.9818286895751952,0.9636573574884875,Positive
Brian its entirely about fuel and the weather event. Those two things alone when you take them out I think were going to see underlying strength in the business as we report the first quarter. But January started out very well. February was deeply impacted by the weather event. March looks like its coming along just fine. And I think were just going to run out of runway.,UNP,0.8981043100357056,0.7962084986022107,Positive
Right. Okay. One thing that weve all seen obviously as a service challenges through weather. And even before that with a lot of congestion on the West Coast ports. But one thing I think we havent really seen is UPs have similar issues as your peer. So why do you think that is and weve also seen youre putting in some surcharges and maybe some adjustments in terms of the minimum commitment program. So are those to kind of tweak the situation and get through what weve seen now. Are there more changes to come How do you keep that fluid when it looks like theres just no end to the container ships off shore,UNP,0.9893885850906372,0.9787771575314745,Positive
Yes. So lets start with the MCP program and the surcharges. Those surcharges are built around making sure we have boxes available in the EMP and UMAX programs for our committed customers. And we were finding some of those boxes were making their way in an inefficient way away from the MCP customers. So to control that what we do is we put those surcharges on and increase them pretty dramatically to force those boxes back so we can make sure they go to the committed customers.,UNP,0.9953681230545044,0.9907362405873779,Positive
So its been a very strong market late last year and into the early part of this year. Most of those surcharges if not all of them are off at this point. When it comes to our performance in the West Coast the rail service product has been sound. Our third quarter difficulties with the snap in ecommerce volumes and parcel volumes they were pretty much addressed in the fourth quarter or going even into the fourth quarter.,UNP,0.1443159580230713,-0.7113691040093326,Negative
And our service product there was really pretty sound and stayed very good into January prior to the weather event. So what were trying to do is work with the ports to create much more transparency and visibility across the supply chain and also make sure that were all speaking to the same KPIs or at least the KPIs that are relevant to getting boxes off the dock into a well and move them.,UNP,0.9992671608924866,0.9985343209113604,Positive
Theres a lot of transload demand thats happening in the LA basin and to a large degree thats kind of  except the supply chain. With the international boxes trying to be put back to Asia as quickly as possible IPI or international boxes coming inland has really been disrupted more so than normal. And I think thats kind of screwed up the overall supply chain with an excess demand of domestic boxes.,UNP,0.0027384161949157,-0.9945243564393262,Negative
Right. And I think when you look at the other thing weve seen in the West Coast and Western rail dynamic rather is this gap in the OR is really just growing. But still weve seen competition that doesnt seem like a lot of what I mentioned coal earlier in the year and the contract law state is going to weigh pretty substantially on the whole business. So how do you just keep on doing what youre doing Is there anything you can do differently in regards to managing through that competition Is it still going to be a headwind It feels like we keep talking about this every year regardless of how big the OR gap gets.,UNP,0.0860327780246734,-0.8279355334851346,Negative
Yes. We do have a strong competitor in the West and also we compete aggressively with truck. What were doing about it is taking our better service product its more reliable its very consistent and also taking our lower cost structure and competing and making sure were winning business that can support itself on the railroad. And were doing that. We see across every single one of our commodity groups whether its in the industrial products area crushed glass or refined product in the bulk area it can be grain. Its also  weve won some business in the coal world. And in the premium business were seeing a really good bid season right now with beneficial cargo owners and shippers. And were also seeing some wins in the automotive space. So were seeing wins be able to come from the better cost basis and our better service product. But we do have a very strong competitor in the West and theyre not lying down.,UNP,0.9999424815177916,0.9998849629670159,Positive
Maybe not. One of the other challenges I think the industry has done a pretty good job so far with is just labor. So with the expectations that things come back we get through the weather issues. How do you feel about positioning of labor and headcount on the network Its always challenging to get the volume right and then to get the right people in the right place for the volume. If you hired a head do you feel like youve got more of a buffer How do you approach that coming out of the coal snap,UNP,0.0910662412643432,-0.8178686010054357,Negative
Yes we feel like were in pretty good shape as regards labor Brian. We havent run into labor as being a fundamental issue being able to support our service product. We currently still have a fair amount of our employees furloughed somewhere near 2000 just under. And our callback rates to this point have been somewhere between 70 and low 80s. So those numbers tell me that if we need to call back labor weve got the ability we can put them where we need them. But were also still seeing plenty of productivity opportunities both in train length in locomotive productivity and how we maintain the railroad. So I anticipate this year even on the kind of growth were anticipating labor is not going to be that big of a deal for us. So I think were in pretty good shape.,UNP,0.0453491806983947,-0.9093027766363483,Negative
Okay. One of the other concerns I guess just a bigger picture perspective on the operating side is just clearly Jim Vena has been a big change agent and part of getting PSR up and running into the point where you are now performing quite well. So the concern is that some of the operational focus and discipline leaves with them Im sure the current team would disagree. But maybe you can give us a sense as to what you Jim and operating team are doing to make sure theres really a seamless transition.,UNP,0.989368200302124,0.9787363879301476,Positive
Yes. Its a great question. Weve been working on that transition basically since the day showed up right. Jim one of the reasons we hired Jim was that hed be a really good catalyst for us both in pace in risktaking appetite and also in perspective than just seeing things that were old to him that would be new to us. And for the last two two and a half years hes done a really good job of helping the team learn from him see those things. And you know railroading is a team sport right. Jim doesnt wake up and make every decision last year for everybody on the railroad. The idea is to help train and help our team see what needs to be done make sure we have the metrics in front of us that are the important ones to move and then make the right decisions.,UNP,0.9999752640724182,0.9999505281153489,Positive
So what Jims working on right now with me and for me is more intermodal focused weve got a couple of special projects some terminal projects. I want to make sure he keeps his eye on. But the team that is underneath Eric Gehringer theyre the ones that have been running the railroad for the last couple of years. And theyre fully competent. Theyre very very good at being able to find productivity taking risks and making it real. And theyre the ones that have been generating the kind of performance we saw all through last year.,UNP,0.078091949224472,-0.8438172005517487,Negative
It has been pretty substantial performance improvements in a lot of areas setting all time records and we do like the KPIs that you put out there. The one that we continue to I guess ask questions on is just on the fuel economy side I know that mix is the impact of that as well. But when we look at just benchmarking UP versus the peers there is a gap. It seems like its been there for maybe a while. So I dont know if its really going to close or what could get it to close because it seems like youre already running pretty heavy trains. What else could  what else should we be looking for to close the gap Because its a OR story its an ESG story as well.,UNP,0.8657622337341309,0.7315243074442788,Positive
Yes youre exactly right. It maybe most important is an ESG story and a climate change support story. Yes. So your point is valid and that is  there is a gap between industry leadership and us. And it used to be mostly about the Canadian railroads and UP and I see CSX has made a real strong move. If you look back to last year we improved about 2 percentage points in our C rate. We think theres more of that to come. And there is a structural difference right. Weve got bigger grades than anybody else in the West and that will impact fuel consumption.,UNP,0.9856678247451782,0.9713356324050619,Positive
But were confident we can be better than what we are right now. And thats mostly about making sure technology continues to take hold in EMS. Thats the system that helps an engineer run a train fuel efficiently. We also think theres continued improvement that can be had with train size so thatll help. And theres continued improvement that can be had as we rebuild the locomotive network the locomotive fleet were not buying new locomotives but we are still investing in locomotive modernization. And every time we do that the unit is more reliable and its more efficient. So theres going to be a little tailwind created by that.,UNP,1.0,1.0,Positive
Got it. Okay. You mentioned intermodal growth clearly is one of the strong points here and Jims working on some of this I guess wrap up in terms of the specific projects. But we think about intermodal growth at UPs you said its historically mixed dilutive or mixes you down but then it seems like its starting to change. What are some of the steps you can take to maybe close that gap Is there any investments or is it really more about getting service consistent and execution to get essentially paid for that,UNP,0.9999893307685852,0.9999786615244517,Positive
Yes theres really no different magic in the intermodal product than there isnt a carload product. Its all about turning the assets efficiently. And youve seen us make a fair number of changes over the course of the last year or year and a half in terms of accessorial charges that are targeted to help our customers know the behaviors that help keep the assets efficient whether its chassis or boxes dwell time on the ramp and behaviors that kind of get in the way.,UNP,0.9519707560539246,0.9039414548524944,Positive
So its about getting the box from where it is into a well as efficiently as we can. That means keeping the ramp time low making dray the driver experience very good enter the gate know where youre going preferably drop the box off track side as opposed to put it into storage. And then we can move it over the road efficiently. Weve demonstrated that. Our service products rock solid once you get it over the road. And then once it hits the destination ramp its about getting it grounded as quickly as possible and then making sure that we have a home for it on the street somewhere. So it doesnt dwell in the yard.,UNP,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
One of the things that were working very hard on is an intermodal train reservation system an ITR. And its gaining traction in fits and starts but at the end of the day thats not meant to retard future volume in anyway. Its meant to match current capacity with current demand. The better we can do that the more we can make sure that those assets turn efficiently and reliable and we need about call it three or four or fiveday advanced notice depending on where the demand is going to be for us to match our capacity with demand. And so were working really hard to get that mature and to get customers comfortable with it so that they can see participating in a very effective ITR is a self fulfilling prophecy to have a really good sound reliable service product.,UNP,0.9999994039535522,0.999998807906394,Positive
Thats interesting. It brings up the question of just supply chain connectivity and visibility. I think comments in the past about needing to get that better in intermodal in particular. So is there anything you  any connections any other things you need from your customers It sounds like its probably something that just builds gradually over time. I guess the question is structurally do you need better visibility better coordination thats maybe not there yet. Or is it just something thats already there and you just got to get it turned on and maybe get better acceptance in the market.,UNP,0.9186525344848632,0.8373049719959329,Positive
Yes. In our market for the intermodal product you can imagine theres a spectrum of customers some are very very tech savvy and others less so once youre in our IMC world and deep into the IMC world. So what were working on is making sure our information and our technology is seamlessly connected with our customer base. Usually thats through APIs and were getting more and more buyin to using APIs to make a greater visibility happen across the supply chain. But it also doesnt have to be that complex right. It can be as straightforward as making sure we get good participation in an effective ITR part of the bonuses on Union Pacific and making it very easy to deal with.,UNP,0.9999996423721312,0.9999992847438361,Positive
And then rolling out products like weve rolled out in UPGo where a DRA driver can show up to a gate on a ramp and know exactly where they need to go with no interaction with humans. It should be ultimately paperless. And so that can create a better environment a more efficient environment for the DRA community thats giving us more visibility there as well. And then across the spectrum making sure that weve got good visibility at each ramp and that our customers see that and good visibility across the network. Ultimately what our customers are relying on us for is making sure we get a crossroad we got good ETAs we land the product where they need it landed in the ballpark of time where we said it would be and then we hold them accountable for dragging it off quickly so that they can get to their destination and use the box and the chassis asset license.,UNP,0.9998331069946288,0.9996662137903054,Positive
So I think you also hired a new CIO I think it was late last year. You can talk about what theyre doing why you brought them in what their background is and what they bring to the railroad because clearly its getting more connected and more digital by the day.,UNP,0.9495235681533812,0.8990470761341307,Positive
Absolutely. Yes our new CIO is Rahul Jalali and we hired him early November from Walmart. And what he brings to the table is a deep knowledge base both in technology but more importantly from my perspective the concept of a platform and a technology ecosystem so that our customers can view us from the product platform perspective when it comes to technology. So his experiencebased was international it was transforming the store experience. It was about having to keep those systems up and running at 49s reliability all that translates to us. And what we really benefit from is increased pace of change. Hes got a very strong appetite for minimally viable product development.,UNP,0.998703122138977,0.9974062427319543,Positive
So agile is a kind of a way of life for him. Weve been working more and more toward an agile environment. Hes just going to accelerate that for us. And then you talk about that product or platform perspective. And what that means is instead of building out big monolithic structures that take a long long time to develop and are based on precise kind of demands put on us by whoevers buying the product were instead working with our customer base finding what the opportunities are and then very rapidly deploying something that could work and testing it.,UNP,0.9981205463409424,0.9962410904414001,Positive
And then building off of it in concentric rings to ultimately get to a place where youve got a full blown platform but instead of waiting and building it out in its entirety and usually getting some part of it wrong youre advancing it in increments quickly. And if you fail you get rid of it and you replace it with something that works. And were already seeing that happen inside the company on things like UP Vision which is a tool we use in the operating department and thats now being translated with our customer base as well.,UNP,0.9934011697769164,0.9868023316874095,Positive
Great. You mentioned earlier that the truckload competition being a maybe beneficiary of the current pricing environment. So based on some of the work weve done UP has probably the biggest opportunity to convert freight off the highway over 750 miles. Whats  how do you look at that market and that potential and kind of gauge the wallet share that you have right now And maybe what if it could be Then also if you can just tell us why arent customers converting now as a way to figure out what you need to get them to say yes and to remain sticky and not just move with the truckload cycle.,UNP,0.9999902844429016,0.9999805688742214,Positive
Yes. Thats a great question Brian. And that is the future right Growth is so important for our value creation as we look forward. And we agree completely with you that theres a lot of opportunity out there. We think about it as a share of our customers logistics spend we call it wallet share. And the baseline that has to happen is we have to have reliable and consistent service right Every customer tells us do what you say youre going to do and I can build around you. And then the second thing we have to do is keep our cost structure low so that we can compete against truck. Truck has some inherent advantages a lot of route flexibility but we have inherent advantages and that our cost structure is quite competitive.,UNP,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
So for us to win weve got a smartly leverage debt cost structure. Weve got to make sure we keep our service product highly reliable and efficient. And then weve also got to continue to invest in technology and ease of doing business. Weve got a project right now thats called User Experience for Customer Experience. And what that means is were investing a lot of time and attention in making the user experience on Union Pacific systems much easier kind of much more intuitive much more consumer luck. We think if we do that we take away some impediments from shippers choosing rail versus truck.,UNP,0.999998152256012,0.9999963045098212,Positive
Part of it is making sure were there to educate them on what role we can play. But part of it is helping them not choose a way because they get frustrated because they dont know a stick code for a particular commodity. So were investing a boatload of time and resources in that right now. And I expect us to accelerate that.,UNP,0.901520848274231,0.8030415791520948,Positive
Thats a good point. In terms of the improving operating ratio and clearly youre focused on growth thats part of the three legged stool you mentioned in prior times assuming thats not changing. But we tend to think of  the market tends to think of you have  theres a tradeoff at some point with growth in OR and thats probably true to a certain extent but we look at it that you have additional capacity and as long as you have the discipline to bring it on at the right characteristics to the network then you can probably still do both. So I dont know if thats the right way to look at or one way of looking at it. But how do you look at balancing those two dynamics which are clearly what everybodys trying to figure out like where does that go right now and how you positioned to move in the future on that curve,UNP,0.9999998807907104,0.9999997615812788,Positive
We think youre 100 right Brian. We do not think theres a tradeoff as we look into the future between growth and operating ratio we think theres room for both. The way we think its going to work is exactly as you point out. We do have some excess capacity both in the network and another assets whether its locomotive some of our freight carved different types. And in that context were not going to be silly or kind of stupid about how we bring business on but to the extent that we bring business on thats got good attractive margin it fits the network and it fits into how were running the network we think is going to be additive. And that gives us a lot of opportunity to create productivity off of that growth which will allow us an opportunity to continue to improve margin. So we look forward and as weve guided this year and we look into future years we think theres margin improvement at the same time as were growing. As a matter of fact we think growth is the way towards some of the next steps in margin.,UNP,0.9999995231628418,0.9999990463251152,Positive
So when you look at the mid50s thats always the gold standard the double nickels some of us thought that 2021 might be the year that that could come to fruition especially after the fourth quarter it was quite strong. I know theres a lot of tailwinds then and theres some headwinds now clearly whether has been a challenge its always hard to gauge the full year when you start January 1. But when you look at all the moving parts there and was there anything that really held back from making the fourth quarter or recent performance more broadly the proof point that that is possible Or was it just too much to get into that early in the year to put your foot down and say this is the year. How do you think of that Are these maybe the structure of how we should think of getting to that 55 at some point,UNP,0.8227200508117676,0.6454398902892413,Positive
Yes. So let me start with our guidance and just reaffirm it because its a hell of a good year right We said the starting points of 58.5 operating ratio last year were going to improve that 150 basis points or more. We said 500 million in productivity this year and some growth. I think mid single digits growth. I cant remember the exact number but thats a hell of a good year. Now the fourth quarter was one hell of a good quarter and it did have a fair number of tailwinds but at the guts of the quarter it demonstrated what were capable of doing when you have decent price pretty good growth and really sound productivity working together. We think that formula continues to work as we look into the future.,UNP,0.9906125068664552,0.9812250025421398,Positive
Now one thing about this year its becoming a little clearer but at the very beginning of the year its pretty damn cloudy is to know exactly whats going to happen in our served markets. Think about what I said at the very beginning the parcel and ecommerce part of our business is booming and thats about consumer spending money and buying things. But the industrial economy is not its still lagging. So theres a disconnect there broadly in the industrial economy and we need to see the industrial economy start picking it up a little bit for us to feel really really confident about whats going to happen in 2021 and 2022. But having said all that the guidance still stands. And in that guidance I think its a hell of a year. And Ill never argue against you Brian if you say you should be able to do more if you grow better than you guided because I think thats true.,UNP,0.009277194738388,-0.9814467915575456,Negative
Yes. Theres expectations and then theres fair expectations. But I understand the point. When you think of the  switching gears for a second into maybe the longer term Positive Train Control has been with the network and with the industry for some time now its finally in place interoperability is up and running I know it was a challenge for UP in prior years to get all those bugs worked out trains were stopping clearly not the most efficient thing. Are you at the point where at least you can see some maybe green shoots in terms of getting some benefits Can you run dynamic blocks too early to think about maybe some positives coming out of this mandate,UNP,0.9707697629928588,0.9415394911405388,Positive
Yes. Brian so it is a little too early on dynamic block but theres a lot of exciting things that the infrastructure that Positive Train Control represents allows us to do. And so just two good examples. The first is I mentioned EMS energy management systems on the locomotives. The structure that EMS plugs into ultimately is PTC infrastructure. Theres a lot of communication that goes between back office and the locomotive dynamics that are happening on the locomotive. And EMS is feeding back information to the engineer for the engineer to prompt on. And even now it can run an autopilot once the train has started EMS can essentially run the train in cruise control for maximizing fuel consumption. That would not have been we would not have had nearly the path  the straightforward path weve had if we hadnt first invested in Positive Train Control.,UNP,0.996054708957672,0.9921094132121877,Positive
The second thing that we do is is kind of both at operating practices and a safety perspective. Weve set up a team of individuals called Operating Practices Command Center here in our Union Pacific center in Omaha. And they can communicate with any train at any time around our network. And what they do is they use the feedback loops that are fundamentally built off of the PTC mesh of communication and information and they monitor trains. And as trains are approaching a particularly difficult territory for that type of train theyll contact the engineer and ask that the engineer would like a little dialogue about whats coming up and how best to manage the train from a safety as well as an efficiency standpoint. And that would not have been in place had it not been for all of the PTC spend. And that has huge benefit to us both in ultimately knocking down things like derailments  human factor derailments but also thatll be a help when it comes to fuel consumption.,UNP,0.9996344447135924,0.9992688889914088,Positive
Right so that does seem to tie in a little bit into the ESG story from a the E and the sustainability and the safety side. You mentioned you had a slide on ESG overall. Youve been putting out sustainability reports since I think like 2009. Clearly its being more of a focal point for just about everybody. AR has its own white paper out on the topic. But when you look at the business perspective there Im sure theres some who are allocating some freight awards based on ESG and relative emissions is clearly part of truckload conversion as well. But do you feel like that were just at the early stages in terms of that being part of the commercial decision its at the strategic level but its not at the procurement level when it comes to actually making those freight decisions on which mode and with whom,UNP,0.9996917247772216,0.9993834491869502,Positive
Brian it is starting to show up at the procurement level mostly in the larger more sophisticated shippers I see an ongoing periodic review of big wins that weve secured. And in the last couple of months I can tell you theres about four or five fairly substantial wins that are predicated on us being a help to that customer in their own sustainability goals. And thats becoming a bigger and bigger store and we emphasize it with every single one of the customers we talked to. Because we can help them were not only helping ourselves we can help them. Last year by choosing to ship on Union Pacific Railroad our customers saved or avoided 25 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions thats a pretty big deal.,UNP,0.9999594688415528,0.9999189376347888,Positive
So we only have a couple minutes left here. Maybe just to talk about you mentioned the stimulus and theres obviously a lot of things coming out of Washington under the new administration. One thing we try to keep an eye on too is just on the regulatory side. So weve got a new STB Board Chairman weve got two new members it feels like activity is picking up but maybe not activist is how we would at least characterize it. But theres some big issues in front of them or at least theyve been talking about. So how do you view that at least from the rail perspective and what are your expectations in terms of the ongoing dialogue and looking at some of these issues which quite frankly have been around for years,UNP,0.8997994065284729,0.7995986936084589,Positive
Yes. Well so weve had very good relationship with the STB. To this point weve maintained those relationships with the existing board members. Were starting to build relationships with the new board members. We think its critically important that the entire Board understands how the economics of a railroad work and whats important to have happen from their perspective so that we can continue to attract capital and put it effectively into the railroad. The creation of the STB was all about making sure that railroads had an opportunity to become revenue adequate attract capital and not face kind of the situation we were facing in the late 1970s. And its been a home run. So we constantly are educating the new members about that history and about why its important.,UNP,0.99964702129364,0.9992940421664964,Positive
They do have a big docket in front of them. Im pretty confident theyre going to be prudent in how they work through it. And weve been proactive as an industry and Union Pacific as a leader in proposing some different things for them to think about as theyre facing their docket. One thing thats really pretty damn important is when it comes to thinking about revenue adequacy over the last couple of years the Board has talked about maybe using that as a measurement as a yardstick for whether or not there would be any rate control. And we turned that around and said but that doesnt make sense because were competing for capital against a broad set of industrials. So we proposed instead of just looking at the railroads and are you earning your cost of capital look at our ability to earn against our cost of capital versus all of the competitive environment for investor dollars.,UNP,0.9999330043792723,0.9998660086786797,Positive
And if were way way out of that box lets have a conversation. But if were just competitive in that box then let us compete. And the data shows were basically in the middle of the pack when it comes to that comparison. And in many cases in comparison to the customers that are complaining to the STB were not earning as much against our cost of capital as they are. So I think thats a really good eye opening use of data to help the Board to see the competitive dynamic were talking about when it comes to trying to attract capital.,UNP,0.7688735723495483,0.53774686917476,Positive
Right right. Okay. Maybe well just wrap up with  I mean you gave us a little bit of a sneak peek on the Investor Day. Clearly youre going to have earnings between now and then. But just from like the objectives and the messaging that youre wanting to set out and that we should expect for this sort of event its not inperson like I think you initially wanted obviously everybody wants but to show kind of the bench strength of operations. So I guess what are you planning on talking about or at least what should we be anticipating to hear from you in terms of the longer term view of the strategic view I guess who we should hear from at the event as well,UNP,0.9999983310699464,0.9999966621379033,Positive
Yes. At the highest level Brian what youre going to hear from us is a clear articulation of the strategy going forward that creates value should be very easy to absorb and understand. We know that theres a question mark about hey what is the bench strength at UP and lets be a little bit more granular about how exactly youre going to continue to find ways to have a reliable consistent service product continue to drive precision scheduled railroading continue to find productivity. So youll see us be pretty direct and straightforward about that. I think we got to show our investors how we are going to grow what those growth engines are what the legs are how much opportunity there is and how were going to secure it.,UNP,1.0,1.0,Positive
And then wrap that all together with some markers for what the next handful of years should look like and then measure ourselves against those markers. So Investor Day is going to look just like that strategy confidence building in our operating capability confidence building in our ability to grow and then wrapping it together with a scorecard that youre going to be able to measure us against for the next handful of years.,UNP,0.9995412826538086,0.9990825647607833,Positive
Okay. One of the scorecards of late has been pretty good and detailed. So thank you for that. And thank you for the preview I know its a hard thing to talk about but not give away too much especially right now. So thanks for entertaining that question. Thats all the time we have for questions unfortunately. So Lance it was great to have you again today. Thank you for all your time. Thanks for everybody for joining. And I hope you have a good rest of the conference.,UNP,0.9999999403953552,0.9999998807906394,Positive

Thank you Sara and thank you to everyone joining us today. Its not an understatement to say that 2020 was memorable for everyone. Despite the challenges we face collectively its been inspiring to see how innovation in the pharma and biotech industries have persevered to the benefit of society. Although this is what our industry does day in and day out I am grateful to see that heroic efforts being universally applauded.,URGN,0.9999908208847046,0.9999816417584668,Positive
While that work has rightfully been on the forefront many diseases dont become front page news but they do take center stage for the individuals who have been diagnosed. UroGen is focused on developing treatments focused on urologic and specialty cancers.,URGN,4.819035530090332e-05,-0.9999048113255569,Negative
Last year our first approved therapy Jelmyto became the first and only FDA approved nonsurgical treatment option for adult patients with a lowgrade upper tract urothelial cancer. Although launching Jelmyto in the midst of the COVID19 pandemic certainly presented challenges. We are incredibly pleased with the way our team has responded to those challenges in the first two full quarters of launch. We recorded 8 million in net product sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 11.8 million since June 1 2020 launch.,URGN,0.2293735444545745,-0.5412538297497214,Negative
We continue to be mindful of the environment were operating in including the vaccine rollout and its impact on the healthcare system and the patient populations we serve. We have seen these trends have an impact on patient procedures including Jelmyto uptake in the first two months of 2021.,URGN,0.2399640679359436,-0.5200727701620877,Negative
We continue to closely monitor and Jeff and Molly will provide more details on our progress shortly. But we remain confident in the outlook for continued and accelerated adoption as the year progresses.,URGN,0.9218312501907348,0.8436624071970027,Positive
And the demonstration of whats possible makes us even more enthusiastic for whats to come. Weve made important progress in advancing our pipeline and executing on our near and longterm growth strategies.,URGN,0.9971460103988647,0.9942920173955068,Positive
Most recently we initiated the ATLAS trial our Phase 3 clinical study of our lead product candidate UGN102 for patients diagnosed with lowgrade intermediate risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. Were very excited about the UGN102 program for many reasons but mainly for the significant unmet need in this patient population with no FDA approved primary treatment options.,URGN,0.0021928250789642,-0.9956155393216249,Negative
We believe that there are important similarities across the therapeutic indications for both Jelmyto and UGN102 and we hope to leverage our learnings and experience from Jelmyto and apply those to UGN102 and its potential for these approximately 80000 patients annually in the U.S. alone. The lowgrade intermediate risk patient is a unique patient population identified as at high risk for recurrence and current standard is just not good enough.,URGN,0.8752723932266235,0.7505446377662646,Positive
In our Phase 2b study 57 of patients had received three or more TURBT surgeries prior to enrolling in the trial. These patients deserve better options and if UGN102 is approved these patients may benefit from the first primary nonsurgical treatment options.,URGN,0.0341606438159942,-0.9316798637389325,Negative
We were very encouraged by the data we share from the OPTIMA II trial showing a strong complete and importantly durable response and believe it supports 1  UGN102s potential as an outpatient treatment option for these patients. We intend to present these data at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer reviewed journal.,URGN,0.9976389408111572,0.9952778788077108,Positive
Our work extends beyond lowgrade disease to highgrade disease. Our earlystage programs most notably UGN302 is initially being studied in highgrade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer a life threatening disease with risk of progression.,URGN,0.0052201747894287,-0.9895608362918117,Negative
We believe that UGN302 which is a combination of UGN201 our TLR 78 agonist and UGN301 the antiCTLA4 antibody that we licensed for Agenus combined with our gel technology has the potential to transform this disease and provide an advanced are currently available treatment options.,URGN,0.9734876155853271,0.9469751995654103,Positive
The recently announced threeyear research collaboration with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is aimed at advancing this combinatorial intravesical immunotherapy for the treatment of highgrade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer with initial focus on UGN302. Were particularly excited to leverage the collective experience of Dr. James Allison and Dr. Pam Sharma who have both been instrumental in developing breakthrough therapies with immunooncology.,URGN,0.9935516119003296,0.9871032161135769,Positive
We continue to expand our focus in immunotherapy research utilizing our proprietary technology with checkpoint inhibitors as reflected in this weeks announcement of a nonclinical sponsored research agreement with Johns Hopkins University to explore this combination in Glioblastoma Multiforme or GBM an aggressive and difficult to treat brain cancer.,URGN,0.7883040904998779,0.5766079286384158,Positive
These two important programs with world renowned academic institutions are part of our ongoing efforts to expand our pipeline and realize the full potential of our proprietary RTGel platform.,URGN,0.8872485160827637,0.7744968977552042,Positive
As we look ahead we are pleased to announce that we completed a strategic transaction with RTW providing funding of 75 million. We believe this will serve to fuel our mission to advance and bring life altering therapies to patients. Molly will provide additional detail on this important transaction shortly. This funding ensures a solid financial outlook for our company.,URGN,0.9190638065338136,0.8381275165841084,Positive
As we look ahead we are building a company to transform how we treat specialty cancers and neurologic diseases. We have and continue to deliver on all of our commitments and I am proud of the work we are doing. We face challenges every day and our colleagues rise to overcome barriers because we share a vision to have an impact on patients that need our medicines. We have a strong foundation to ensure a longterm growth business and realize leadership by delivering new approaches to patients that have been left behind.,URGN,0.8928713798522949,0.7857426319972467,Positive
With that Ill turn the call over to Mark to discuss our recent clinical update. Mark,URGN,0.9305195808410645,0.8610390788549656,Positive
Thank you Liz. Its exciting to see the impact Jelmyto is having on real world practice and an exciting time for patients as we continue to expand our pipeline in important areas of urooncology.,URGN,0.997267246246338,0.9945344892349777,Positive
During the fourth quarter of 2020 Dr. Surena Matin from MD Anderson presented the final durability data from our Phase 3 OLYMPUS pivotal trial evaluating Jelmyto in lowgrade upper tract urothelial cancer in a virtual podium presentation at the 21st Annual Meeting of the Society of Urologic Oncology.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We were pleased to see that in both the OLYMPUS intent to treat population and in the subpopulation of patients who were deemed to have unresectable disease. At study entry 58 of patients achieved a complete response with durability of response at 12 months estimated to be 81.8 by KaplanMeier analysis. Median time to recurrence was not reached. The safety profile in the OLYMPUS data was consistent with previously reported results.,URGN,0.2273671627044677,-0.5452665956417297,Negative
This was previously a disease where options for patients included multiple endoscopic procedures or the removal of the kidney and ureter both of which have consequences impacting patient health and quality of life.,URGN,0.2333202362060547,-0.533360441541935,Negative
These final durability data from OLYMPUS were in line with our expectations and support the use of Jelmyto as a less invasive kidney preserving durable treatment for a lowgrade upper tract urothelial carcinoma which may reduce the need for multiple endoscopy procedures or loss of a kidney.,URGN,0.0482114553451538,-0.9035782239307308,Negative
We also have several updates to provide for our UGN102 program since our last quarterly call. The first of which is the final topline data from the OPTIMA II Phase 2b trial evaluating UGN102 as primary therapy in patients with lowgrade intermediate risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer that we announced in November.,URGN,0.0648064017295837,-0.8703883113791415,Negative
This study shows that 65 of patients 41 and 63 received the UGN102 achieve the complete response three months after the start of therapy. In this subset of patients duration of response to 12 months from start of therapy was estimated by KaplanMeier analysis to be 72.5. The median duration of response was not reached. Treatment with UGN102 was generally well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previously reported results with mostly mild to moderate adverse events that result over time. In the trial we observed typical symptoms of exposure to mitomycin and no treatment related serious adverse events were reported.,URGN,0.0443417131900787,-0.9113177128539759,Negative
As was mentioned we initiated the ATLAS trial our Phase 3 study of UGN102 in December and are actively enrolling patients. ATLAS is a randomized control global study and will enroll approximately 630 patients and compare UGN102 plus or minus transurethral resection of bladder tumor or TURBT to TURBT alone which is standardofcare and patients diagnosed with lowgrade intermediate risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.,URGN,0.0051898956298828,-0.989621394646999,Negative
We are following the same enrollment criteria used in our Phase 2b OPTIMA II trial and expect to enroll a similar population. Patients will be randomized one to one to either upfront UGN102 treatments or TURBT and at the three month time point patients will be assessed for response.,URGN,0.9985353946685792,0.9970707875912117,Positive
Patients who have demonstrated a complete response to either UGN102 or TURBT will be monitored quarterly for evidence of recurrence. Patients who have tumor present on evaluation at three months in either arm will undergo TURBT and then under identical monitoring for recurrence.,URGN,0.930105209350586,0.860210335380039,Positive
The primary endpoint of the study is disease free survival or recurrence free survival in this disease. And the trial is a time to event analysis designed to evaluate noninferiority and superiority. We expect the trial to take approximately one year to enroll and to be completed within approximately three years.,URGN,0.0353386104106903,-0.9293239291452939,Negative
There are no nonsurgical primary therapies approved in this patient population and today patients are managed by repeated transurethral procedures under general anesthesia with a minority of patients receiving adjutant waterbased chemotherapy.,URGN,0.2088273167610168,-0.5823463096298633,Negative
For published literature twothirds of patients have two or more recurrences and approximately onefourth have five or more recurrences throughout the course of their disease. I see these patients in my practice and with each recurrence comes an additional surgery. Although the risk of death from disease is relatively modest the risk of repetitive surgery is real and these risks include unintended hospitalization for bleeding and infection as well as a recently reported risk of increased mortality following multiple surgeries for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.,URGN,1.925230026245117e-05,-0.9999626874701306,Negative
It is our belief that the ATLAS trial is designed to effectively demonstrate UGN102s potential to change the treatment paradigm by providing a useful nonsurgical therapeutic alternative to patients so they can avoid the potential comorbidities and complications that come from repeated TURBT. We look forward to providing enrollment updates on this trial later this year.,URGN,0.9571232199668884,0.9142463888206416,Positive
While there are many similarities with Jelmyto and UGN102 both represent important advances in patient care. One important differentiation is the additional ease of administration that we believe UGN102 may offer patients.,URGN,0.9627281427383424,0.9254562410451421,Positive
Given the feedback weve received from our clinical trials including the potential for a nurse to administer UGN102. We are planning a small feasibility study to assess the potential for athome installation. We are currently in the final planning stages of this study and expect to start sometime this year. We will provide more details as we progress but believe that potential ease and flexibility of administration could be an important differentiator for patients with this disease.,URGN,0.999958872795105,0.9999177455411825,Positive
We were also focused on expanding our immunooncology pipeline specifically UGN302 which is a combinatorial approach initially being developed for patients with highgrade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.,URGN,0.9477143287658693,0.8954285952023242,Positive
As Liz mentioned UGN302 is a combination of UGN201 our TLR 78 agonist and UGN301 or zalifrelimab and antiCTLA4 antibody that we have combined with our RTGel technology. There are significant differences between highgrade disease and a lowgrade disease that we focus on with Jelmyto and UGN102.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Highgrade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer is an aggressive and potentially life threatening malignancy characterized by both a significant risk of recurrence and disease progression to muscle invasive cancer. And we know that some patients with highgrade nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer respond to immunotherapy using Bacillus CalmetteGurin or BCG. So there is a strong predicate rationale for exploring potentially better immunotherapies for the treatment of this patient population.,URGN,0.0057512819766998,-0.98849862128414,Negative
As weve shared before the nonclinical data that the UGN302 program has generated todate have been very encouraging as the combination of UGN201 and an antiCTLA4 antibody resulted in improved survival and decreased tumor size in our murine model.,URGN,0.8428549766540527,0.6857097659765279,Positive
Additionally we observed changes in immunological markers such as decreased T regulatory cells and a trend toward increased CD8 Treg ratios. It is our belief that the data generated todate support the potential of a locally applied combinatorial immunotherapy.,URGN,0.2068545818328857,-0.5862917818378103,Negative
We are thrilled to be collaborating with MD Anderson on this novel program given their expertise in innovative clinical trials and infrastructure. We expect to progress the UGN302 program this year which includes potential nonclinical studies for UGN301 and the combination of UGN201 and UGN301 as well as clinical studies for UGN201. We are working closely with MD Anderson on next steps and trial designs and we will continue to share details as they are available.,URGN,0.9891536235809326,0.9783072342319692,Positive
The second immunooncology program the highlight is an interesting new sponsor research agreement with the Johns Hopkins University where we intend to explore in a preclinical setting the potential of checkpoint inhibitors combined with RTGel in Glioblastoma Multiforme or GBM.,URGN,0.9953237771987916,0.9906475488230879,Positive
This program stems from our focus on expanding our novel RTGel technology in combination with other medicines to provide treatment options for patients in diseases with significant unmet need and where local immune modulation may make a difference.,URGN,0.7567538619041443,0.5135074338361227,Positive
Our focus with this program is GBM an aggressive malignant brain tumor with a fiveyear survival rate of less than 5. GBM is difficult to treat and treatment options today are limited and typically include surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. It is the most common primary brain tumor with around 12000 cases diagnosed per year.,URGN,0.0001300871372222,-0.9997410176640856,Negative
With this research we will examine combining our novel RTGel technology with antiPD1 and antiCTLA4 antibodies respectively to assess the impact on survival in a mouse model of GBM.,URGN,0.9116222262382508,0.8232443471219226,Positive
While early we continue to investigate the potential of our RTGel platform in immunooncology and explore local applications of immunotherapy both within our laboratory and in working with key academic centers who may leverage our technology exploring therapeutic options.,URGN,0.8016467094421387,0.6032931824285879,Positive
And with that Id like to turn the call over to Jeff to provide a commercial update. Jeff,URGN,0.9909632802009584,0.9819265496293008,Positive
Thank you Mark. Im pleased to provide you with an update on our commercial launch of Jelmyto. As Liz mentioned we achieved 8 million in net product sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 11.8 million from the start of Jelmyto launch on June 1st through the end of 2020. This represents a great early start to the launch and is a testament to the important work the team is doing and the value that Jelmyto can bring to adult patients with lowgrade UTUC.,URGN,0.9972357749938964,0.9944715466925778,Positive
The feedback that our team continues to receive from physicians treating their patients with Jelmyto remains extremely positive and we are seeing firsthand the tremendous impact that Jelmyto is making in the lives of patients.,URGN,0.9979172945022584,0.9958345865217368,Positive
The most consistent and recurring themes we hear include patients avoiding surgery and achieving a complete response posttreatment consistent with what weve observed in our clinical trial. Weve heard from a number of physicians who have treated their first patient with Jelmyto received a promising response and are now working on identifying additional patients.,URGN,0.929303765296936,0.8586074463173428,Positive
In November of 2020 we announced that CMS established a permanent and product specific JCode for Jelmyto which took effect on January 1st of this year. The JCode replaces the previously issued and temporary CCode and standardizes and facilitates reimbursement in the hospital outpatient ambulatory surgery center and physician office settings of care. This JCode is helpful in simplifying and streamlining reimbursement for physicians and we believe it will translate into improved access to Jelmyto throughout 2021.,URGN,0.95529043674469,0.9105808201913956,Positive
There are a couple data points Ive been sharing on our calls to help illustrate the success of the launch todate and the growth that weve seen early on. The first is activated site. As of March 1st we have increased our activated sites over 250 sites up from 210 sites at the year end and 165 sites as of November 1 2020.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
These are sites who have treated patients or are ready to treat patients. We expect this number to continue to grow as our sales force 48 reps continue to target hospital and community accounts where most of the patients are treated.,URGN,0.9928545951843262,0.9857091818506609,Positive
The other data point that is important to note is repeat accounts or accounts that have treated more than one patient. As it suggested the physicians are seeing clinical efficacy of the drug the reimbursements working and all of the other components of the process have gone well.,URGN,0.9941322207450868,0.9882644344952314,Positive
As of March 1st we have increased that number to 31 accounts up from 24 accounts at year end and 13 as of November 1st. This is a critical factor demonstrating that the processes and support in place are working and clinicians are identifying additional patients and gaining comfort in using this treatment.,URGN,0.0524461865425109,-0.8951087564878206,Negative
As we continue to expand usage of Jelmyto and reach additional target providers and accounts we expect this number to become less relevant but believe its valuable in the early stages of launch.,URGN,0.8705891370773315,0.7411781198848009,Positive
We have also received compelling market research results showing the increased level of Jelmyto awareness a testament to the teams efforts. As of November 2020 aided awareness increased to 94 up from approximately 70 prelaunch. We also see a slight shift towards physicians viewing radical nephroureterectomy as less favorable than prior to Jelmytos approval and we expect to see that increase.,URGN,0.9807226061820984,0.9614451893837388,Positive
Id like to take a moment to highlight what were seeing in the industry today and the impact of COVID19. We saw that in 2020 cancer diagnoses were down about 40 and for my own market research its evidence that at least onethird of the patients are delaying treatment due to the pandemic.,URGN,0.792535662651062,0.585071077985214,Positive
These phenomena are industrywide and in January 2021 based on the IQVIA data collected procedures were down 25. We are not immune to these trends and are also seeing patients with lowgrade tumors deferring treatment.,URGN,0.0360931754112243,-0.9278147982447138,Negative
While were optimistic for the future January was the harshest month as it relates to COVID deaths in the U.S. and we want to share two potential trends that are important to know as the pandemic continues to evolve.,URGN,0.983512043952942,0.967024068250697,Positive
Given the patient population with lowgrade UTUC is generally in their 70s and make up the majority of patients being vaccinated in the early rollout. These patients have prioritize and we expect nearterm will continue to prioritize receiving the vaccine before seeking treatment.,URGN,0.962879717350006,0.9257593904491603,Positive
Additionally at the hospital level we are aware that some formulary reviews are being delayed because of the vaccine rollout as the hospitals are focused on prioritizing vaccine. These trends are resulting in a softer first quarter of 2021 than previously anticipated.,URGN,0.0335566103458404,-0.9328879313993046,Negative
That being said we are seeing leading indicators of potentially new patient starts in the coming months and all metrics reflect high physician and patient interest in adopting Jelmyto into their practice.,URGN,0.9835198521614076,0.9670396846769362,Positive
Based on the recent interactions Ive had in the field with physicians I continue to hear that physicians are supportive of Jelmyto and its potential benefit to patients. We are closely monitoring this environment as a pandemic and vaccination rollout continues. But anticipate improvement in patient access to treatment providers and to Jelmyto in the coming months as patients and physicians are vaccinated. We will continue to monitor and adapt to ensure patients have access to Jelmyto.,URGN,0.9568448066711426,0.9136895618972551,Positive
Although we are navigating the unchartered territory of this pandemic our team continues to deliver and I would be remiss if I didnt thank our team as well as the many external parties involved including our partners and our healthcare providers for their continued efforts and commitment to patients.,URGN,0.9802025556564332,0.9604050877124597,Positive
Our teams commitment to providing patients with our novel effective and potentially kidney sparing treatment option remains unwavering and we believe our experience with Jelmyto bodes well for potential commercialization of UGN102 if approved.,URGN,0.9996004104614258,0.9992008204465035,Positive
And with that I would like to turn the call over to Molly who will discuss financials.,URGN,0.8514671921730042,0.7029342072809979,Positive
Thank you Jeff and thank you to everyone who joined todays call. Before I discuss our fourth quarter and year end 2020 financials Id like to touch upon the strategic transaction announced this morning with RTW and provide some details.,URGN,0.998991847038269,0.9979836928747254,Positive
We are pleased to partner with RTW and an influential healthcare investor whose mission is to invest in innovative companies looking to bring important new products to patients. RTW is research driven and we believe this investment reflects their confidence in the UroGen team and the important impact that Jelmyto has on patients as well as the excitement surrounding the potential opportunity for UGN102 and nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.,URGN,0.9980896711349488,0.9961793399926069,Positive
The 75 million in funding from RTW puts us in a solid financial position to support the continued launch of Jelmyto and the development of UGN102 in return RTW will receive tiered future cash payments based upon global annual net sales of Jelmyto equal to 9.5 of annual net sales up to 200 million 3 of annual net sales between 200 million and 300 million and 1 of annual net sales above 300 million.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
If certain annual revenue thresholds for Jelmyto aggregate worldwide net sales are not met the future payments with respect to the first year of net sales will increase by 3.5 and thats subsequently decreased depending on meeting certain annual net sales thresholds.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In addition RTW will receive tiered future payments based on global annual net sales of UGN102 subject to FDA approval equal to 2.5 of annual net sales up to 200 million 1 of annual net sales between 200 million and 300 million and 0.5 of annual net sales above 300 million.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Payments based on net sales of both Jelmyto and UGN102 will terminate upon the date that RTW has received an aggregate amount equal to 300 million. We are excited to partner with RTW an industry leader providing UroGen the solid balance sheet to execute on our mission.,URGN,0.0808449983596801,-0.8383110989994402,Negative
I will now take a moment to review the fourth quarter and year end 2020 financials. UroGen recorded net product sales of Jelmyto for the fourth quarter 2020 of approximately 8 million. Full year 2020 net product sales of Jelmyto which launched on June 1 2020 were 11.8 million.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Before turning to cost of revenues Id like to mention a few external trends that were watching as we start 2021. First as Liz and Jeff mentioned we continue to be mindful of the evolving pandemic landscape and expect the vaccine rollout to have an impact on our first quarter 2021 results.,URGN,0.991172194480896,0.9823443784382215,Positive
Second we are cognizant of the severe weather in the U.S. throughout the first quarter of this year and the impact that it has had on shipments of Jelmyto to patients.,URGN,0.0757369399070739,-0.8485272219939364,Negative
Lastly given the concerns over potential shipment delays around the year and holidays last year we received several book orders at the end of 2020 that were recognized in 2020 revenue of approximately 500000 to 800000. We dont anticipate similar bulk purchases or stocking patterns in the first quarter of 2021. Based on these three impacts we are carefully monitoring our Q1 revenues for 2021.,URGN,0.159864455461502,-0.6802720905972068,Negative
Turning to cost of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 and the year ended December 31 2020. Cost of revenues were approximately 652000 and 1 million respectively and included certain onetime startup costs in periods prior to receiving FDA approval of Jelmyto and pursuant to accounting rules we recognize inventory and related costs associated with the manufacturing of Jelmyto as research and development expenses. We expect a favorable impact on cost of revenues through the first quarter of 2022 as we deplete inventories that we had expensed prior to receiving FDA approval.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31 2020 were 12.4 million and 47.3 million respectively compared to 20.1 million and 49.3 million respectively for the same periods in 2019.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Research and development expenses for 2019 included 10 million milestone payment related to our license agreement Agenus. Setting aside that expense research and development expenses increased by 8 million yearoveryear. The increase of 8 million resulted primarily from a onetime payment of 6.6 million to unwind the companys obligations to the Israeli Innovation Authority during the first quarter of 2020 and increase expenses related to UGN102 clinical trial and UGN201 studies partially offset by the completion of the Jelmyto Phase 3 clinical trial and reduce regulatory activity.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Research and development expense also includes 1.4 million and 6.4 million of noncash sharebased compensation expense for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31 2020 respectively as compared to 1.9 million and 8.3 million respectively for the same period in 2019.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Selling general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31 2020 were 22.2 million and 90.2 million respectively as compared to 19.7 million and 60.2 million respectively for the same periods in 2019. The increase in annual selling general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from increased costs and activities related to the commercial launch of Jelmyto in June of 2020 including headcount and related costs associated with building our sales force and administrative costs.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Selling general and administrative expenses included 5.1 million and 21.6 million of noncash sharebased compensation expense for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31 2020 respectively as compared to 6.2 million and 21.7 million respectively for the same period in 2019.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The fourth quarter and year end December 31 2020 we reported a loss of 32.5 million or 1.38 per share and 128.5 million or 5.90 per share respectively. This compares the net losses of approximately 39 million or 1.86 per share and 105.1 million or 5.12 per share respectively for the same periods in 2019. The loss for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31 2020 includes 6.5 million and 28 million respectively of noncash sharebased compensation expense.,URGN,0.0272721946239471,-0.945456770334703,Negative
Our guidance for 2021 operating expenses is in the range of 155 million to 170 million. This is largely driven by the initiation of our Phase 3 ATLAS study late last year. This includes estimated noncash sharebased compensation expense of 24 million to 28 million subject to market conditions.,URGN,0.1469111442565918,-0.7061787284485868,Negative
Lastly we closed the fourth quarter and year end  and the year with approximately 103.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities with no debt. This was supplemented post year end by the 75 million in funding we announced this morning from RTW. We believe we are in a solid position to execute on our strategy.,URGN,0.016018122434616,-0.9679649281292727,Negative

Certainly. Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Chris Howerton from Jefferies. Your question please.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Excellent. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and really appreciate all the progress through a pretty difficult year last year. Great so I guess maybe is to start things off in terms of Jeff for the repeat customers that you saw in terms of the accounts. I guess Im just wondering if theres any trends that you see there categorically is that more tend to be academic centers community centers is  whats your expectations there or kind of what youre seeing first of all And then secondly with respect to the first quarter revenue numbers I guess I just want to fully understand the expected dynamics to the net revenues. I think Molly you said that there were some weather related shipment delays and then there was also perhaps some larger orders in the fourth quarter. And then perhaps theres also something to be understood with respect to the payer environment payment plan resets or anything like that I guess just maybe help us better understand the expected dynamics for the first quarter revenue numbers And I think maybe thats it for now and I might have a followup.,URGN,0.9999025464057922,0.9998050926954107,Positive
Hey. Chris thanks. Its Liz. How are you Ill turn it over to Jeff to answer your first question and then Molly you can talk a little bit more about Q4 and Q1. So Jeff,URGN,0.99995756149292,0.9999151229352494,Positive
Thanks Liz. Hi Chris. And to address your first question that the multiple or the patients or the physicians that have multiple patients its primarily probably 60 to 70 are those in the hospital. But we do have community accounts that have multiple physicians writing Jelmyto for their patients or single physicians that have identified more than one patient as well.,URGN,0.9999547004699708,0.9999094008859404,Positive
So my expectations I can  I  as I said in the past I continue to expect this will translate more into the community some more community practices will begin to adopt and treat multiple patients. But for the time being the predominant number of multiple patients are coming out of the hospital setting.,URGN,0.9964203834533693,0.9928407626395006,Positive
Great. Okay.,URGN,0.9854629039764404,0.9709257906233015,Positive
Hi Chris. To answer your question on the Q1 revenues so as Jeff and I both alluded to we started to see some softness as we went into January and February this year. A lot of the reasons we discussed in our narrative around the vaccine rollout and some other impacts as it relates to weather. To that effect were starting to see the rebound of that.,URGN,0.94410640001297,0.8882127333955367,Positive
And I think when we look at the patient population that we serve it was the same patient population that was getting the vaccination or in the queue to get vaccinated. And so that really trends in line with kind of the rebound were seeing in March. Were still in the first quarter. So were not going to provide any more,URGN,0.0238676369190216,-0.9522658898031054,Negative
Right.,URGN,0.7990214228630066,0.5980426061407365,Positive
clarity as far as where we expect because we still have a few more  a couple more weeks to go. But we certainly wanted to flag that the market because those are some of the dynamics that were watching.,URGN,0.8854312896728516,0.770862442769076,Positive
Okay.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then maybe lastly as it relates to some of the stocking charges we saw last year I referenced about a 500000 to 800000 estimate based upon some indication we got from certain practices that they were looking to stock andor get ahead of any shipment concerns. Remember last years holiday season there was a lot of delays in shipments. So we saw some of that in advance buying last year and were not going to see a similar pattern. So one of the queues and market into some of that dynamic as well.,URGN,0.9957114458084106,0.9914228865044632,Positive
Okay. Great. And maybe just as one clarifying question with respect to that in terms of the shipment delays in the first quarter did that impact any kind of treatment schedule or any effect in terms of the payment  patients or just maybe like initiation of treatment just a clarification there And then another question for Mark would be what do you expect the impact could be of inhome installation and is that primarily in the context of the COVID environment may be very impactful and not so much outside of that or maybe just how youre seeing that would be helpful to understand Thanks.,URGN,0.997925877571106,0.9958517526696637,Positive
Jeff do you want to take the impact to patient treatment,URGN,0.2114678919315338,-0.5770651561410165,Negative
Sure. So it did impact. We had a few that needed to be rescheduled. Fortunately the OLYMPUS trial was designed that though its once weekly and not everyone was got a dose every seven days. So they were able to miss a day or two in the OLYMPUS trial therefore physicians held comfortable and obviously given the weather that we had shipments were delayed by a day or two they just simply reschedule those patients.,URGN,0.0038002729415893,-0.9924006416801464,Negative
Got it.,URGN,0.9141947627067566,0.8283894231256383,Positive
Yeah Chris,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Mark Yeah.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah. Chris thanks for the question about home installation. I think this is an example of something that was really fostered in the company which has been I think accelerated by COVID which is thinking innovatively and out of the box.,URGN,0.9490149021148682,0.8980297434507272,Positive
The concept of home care for patients with recurrent disease is really a very innovative one. But its possible with this therapy. And so we want to explore that because we think it represents a very positive step in the right direction for this population.,URGN,0.8435045480728149,0.6870089095884022,Positive
And obviously we have to do the study in order to examine whether it makes sense but it is a really interesting and I think an innovative way of thinking about the next iteration of treating patients. And COVID I think has made us think about this in accelerated fashion. So I think it has had a little bit to do with COVID. But I also think its completely consistent with our larger corporate goals as you heard Liz articulated many times.,URGN,0.9920029640197754,0.9840059185063352,Positive
Yeah. Okay. All right. Well great. Thanks so much for all the answers and again appreciate all the progress.,URGN,0.9997847080230712,0.9995694157894941,Positive
Thanks Chris.,URGN,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derek Archila from Stifel. Your question please.,URGN,0.7811567783355713,0.5623132957895374,Positive
Hey. Good morning everyone and congrats on the news and the updates here. So just two questions from us. I think the first one is for Jeff. I just wanted to get an understanding is how you think the sales ramp and the trajectory for Jelmyto may be impacted with the JCode now that you have it maybe you can kind of talk to some of the things that have happened or some of the trends thus far in the first quarter And then maybe the second for Liz and Molly now with the RTW investment I guess do you think this is enough run way to get yourself to profitability I just kind of curious how youre thinking about that Thanks.,URGN,0.9998369216918944,0.9996738431893841,Positive
Sure. Good morning Derek.,URGN,0.9940783977508544,0.9881567884426046,Positive
Yeah. Jeff you can answer.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah.,URGN,0.2519094944000244,-0.49618190299385967,Negative
Right.,URGN,0.7990214228630066,0.5980426061407365,Positive
So with regards to the JCode I  what weve seen particularly in the community the community whether its warranted or not tends to be a little bit  have a little bit more anxiety in around miscellaneous code and so they liked having the JCode the product specific code. Theyre being trained with the CMS. CMS has give them guidance on how to build correctly for the drugs. So it certainly is helped with regards to uptake in the community roles as I expected to continue as well having a permanent JCoe.,URGN,0.7529770135879517,0.5059537327013808,Positive
Molly do you want to give your perspective on the financing and then Ill chime in as well.,URGN,0.8930056095123291,0.7860110914773295,Positive
Sure. Hi Derek. Yeah. So were excited to announce that financing this morning. We havent provided any specific guidance on when we anticipate to breakeven but its safe to say this additional funding gets us into 2023 and certainly allows us ability to continue the launch efforts that we have on Jelmyto and the ATLAS trial relating to UGN102.,URGN,0.9999818801879884,0.9999637603543763,Positive
Yeah. I think Derek the other  only other comment Ill make is weve had a lot of questions and comments from investors and around needing to raise money obviously and people wondering where were going to go back out to the market and this is non diluted financing.,URGN,0.0190987884998321,-0.9618035923263982,Negative
And so we just I think this hopefully answers that question. And we dont have a need to go out to the market right now and I think it depends were well funded to do the things that we need to do right now. I think theres always the question of business development right Its something we get we find something were excited about were constantly looking for new opportunities.,URGN,0.9749647378921508,0.9499294459399257,Positive
But so if we find something were excited about that might change things. But at this point in time I think as you Im sure can tell were funded where we need to be and dont expect to be doing any diluted financing anytime soon. So thanks for the question.,URGN,0.9925881624221802,0.9851763160087561,Positive
Yeah. Thanks. Congrats again.,URGN,0.9969927072525024,0.9939854109200303,Positive
Yeah. Thank you Derek.,URGN,0.8992568254470825,0.7985135307988709,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Joseph from J.P. Morgan. Your question please.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning. This is Hannah on for Eric. Thanks for taking the question. Just a few from us. So now that youre further into the launch are you able to speak a little to the frequency of maintenance therapy use in the commercial setting You mentioned earlier that a number of patients have seen a complete response but have you been able to determine what proportion of patients are achieving a CR and how that was compared to the OLYMPUS trial And then I have a followup after that.,URGN,0.9999936819076538,0.9999873638077759,Positive
Yeah. Jeff why dont you take those,URGN,0.2172384858131408,-0.5655239614987144,Negative
Yeah. As I have said its consistent with what we saw on OLYMPUS  the OLYMPUS trial. We  whereas the physician if they choose to tell us how the patient is doing thats information that we have. We havent really maintenance has been something that is in the  its at physician discussion. I will say this we have more patients more physicians considering maintenance and putting patients on maintenance but that the bulk of the majority of the patients are getting the treatment the six doses with no maintenance.,URGN,0.9999970197677612,0.9999940395319697,Positive
Yeah. The only comment about CR what we are seeing is Jeff comment thats anecdotal right We dont capture real world were not capturing real world CR. But from what anecdotally I would say at least as good or better and we have  were  its well tolerated and we do capture obviously MEAs ph that have to come in to the company and so we feel really good about not only the efficacy but the safety as well. So you said you had a follow up question Hannah,URGN,0.951345443725586,0.9026908294503866,Positive
Yes. You had mentioned a little while ago interest in pursuing a retreatment trial just wondering if that was still of interest and if theres any particular timelines where we might see that come to fruition,URGN,0.9984270930290222,0.9968541841829921,Positive
Yeah. Were definitely interested in that and we will start that study as soon as its feasible. The reason I say that is because patients have to recur right So they have to do well on the treatment and then have a recurrence. So we would not see the start that study obviously patients are just starting on the treatment in the last six months. So we wouldnt expect to start that site till the end of this year really into probably 2022.,URGN,0.0167938470840454,-0.9664134779056776,Negative
Having said that just we do know that there were patients that were in the study that have gotten retreated it is in our label today but we would like to generate additional data on retreatment. Its not stopping physicians from retreating patients. As I said its part of our label. But we would like to capture data. But thats  it will be quite a few months before well actually be able to even start that study.,URGN,0.9706478118896484,0.9412955887887411,Positive
Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thanks for taking the question.,URGN,0.9997901916503906,0.99958038305067,Positive
All right. Thank you.,URGN,0.9837081432342528,0.9674162670470874,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Kaplan from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your question please.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi. Good morning and let me add my congratulations to the progress. Just wanted to dig in a little bit to kind of the dynamics of patients receiving treatment that youre seeing I guess given the pandemic and patients not seeing the doctors as you and diagnoses going down. Are you seeing some sort of a backlog of patients given this backdrop and do you think these patients have been did by practices and are just awaiting therapy that youll start to see them roll in to receiving the treatment sometime this year,URGN,0.9998468160629272,0.999693631943245,Positive
Yeah. Hi Matt. Its Liz. Thanks for the question. I am going to ask Jeff to comment. But before he does I think we would speculate right that even in the beginning of our launch there were some patients that had not come in as you saw COVID cases go down somewhat we did and Jeff did nice work on understanding the dynamics of COVID versus our patients.,URGN,0.9995450973510742,0.999090194159862,Positive
And you can clearly see that when diagnosis of COVID went down patients went up. So we do think that even in the first six months of the launch were likely patients that had been kind of waiting. And so I think that dynamic exists. Its hard to quantify. But Jeff wed love for you to share with Matt your perspective.,URGN,0.9917207956314088,0.9834415813932311,Positive
Sure. Thanks Matt. And I guess to easily answer the question it depends on the where in the country you are how bad the cases have been when did they put into place that they put in a delay in elective procedures. I will say majority that had put in electric procedures are on hold. I have now open elective procedures up. And to your point Matt they do begin then to prioritize these patients. And so as we see  as weve seen with COVID going down cases going down weve seen an increase in patient enrollments.,URGN,0.992473602294922,0.9849471956176734,Positive
Okay. Thats helpful. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have now I guess over 250 sites activated. Can you give us a sense in terms of the number of those sites that have treated a patient so far,URGN,0.9999058246612548,0.9998116492102438,Positive
Liz,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah.,URGN,0.2519094944000244,-0.49618190299385967,Negative
we havent provided yeah those,URGN,0.8128451108932495,0.6256899986803524,Positive

Exactly.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah. Okay. And then I guess maybe a question for Mark on the ATLAS study. Can you give us a sense in terms of just remind us of the kind of the endpoint and the powering of that study for the lowgrade intermediate risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer,URGN,0.0645384490489959,-0.8709242170597418,Negative
Sure. Thanks Matt. Im sure as you probably remember in our discussions the primary endpoint is recurrence free or disease free survival. And its an event driven trial. So the objective here is to look for curb separation between the group receiving primary UGN102 versus those who are treated primarily with surgery. There are planned interim analyses that are event driven. So we cant tell you when those will occur.,URGN,0.9751752018928528,0.9503503741922226,Positive
And I think thats probably about what weve shared along with the fact that we know that in the control arm we expect recurrence rates to be approximately 50 or higher at a year weve been pretty conservative about our design. So I hope thats helpful in terms of thinking about the trial. But the primary endpoint is recurrence free survival. And Liz may want to comment further on this as well.,URGN,0.9170758724212646,0.8341516459892071,Positive
No. I think thats right. I think the powering to your point  to your question Matt. As Mark said we used around a 50 knowing that in the literature anywhere from 50 to 80 of those patients will recur if they only have a TURBT and are  meet the criteria for intermediate risk and obviously we used our own Phase 2 data for the assumptions but on a conservative side for us as well. So put ourselves in a position where we can be successful from a technical standpoint.,URGN,0.7679200768470764,0.5358398770331603,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Choi from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.,URGN,0.7811567783355713,0.5623132957895374,Positive
Hi. Good morning team and let me add my congratulations on the progress as well. I want to maybe just revisit ATLAS if we could and just with regard to your comments with regard to patients being treated at home. I guess my question is twofold here first. Do you see this as potentially for this lowgrade intermediate risk population as a potential real world treatment paradigm versus being treated in the clinic or in the hospital And then secondly if it would be  if there is potential for at home treatment model here how does that potentially affect the economics of UGN102 or just like a function of the environment were in currently,URGN,0.9999232292175292,0.9998464583435405,Positive
Yeah. Thanks Paul. How are you The  I think from our perspective we want to make things as easy as possible on patients. You start to think about TURBT. I think one of the missed information misunderstanding is that people think of TURBT no big deal. As we share 57 of the patients in our study had three or more TURBT the patient population were talking about.,URGN,0.9946860074996948,0.9893720086646132,Positive
And as they have more and more we know its an independent factor of mortality. So were saying how one can we differentiate our therapy from whats there today which frankly doesnt work. And we do know that more and more this is an elderly patient population. So its just one additional way.,URGN,0.9813411235809326,0.9626822249187379,Positive
We still think that frankly the majority of the patients will go in to the clinic to get treated. But having an opportunity to treat these patients at home I think will be a benefit to some of those patients who are unwilling or unable to get to the doctor make it easier on them.,URGN,0.9821114540100098,0.9642228866951983,Positive
I dont think it will impact the financials at all because obviously you would get treated at home. They  it would be through a home health company. So I guess the difference is for physicians obviously they would make more money if the patient comes into the office but the  again ability to offer that to patients and have that as an option we think is important. So the financials for us dont really change the financials for the office obviously would if the patient came into their office they would see the revenue associated with that.,URGN,0.9970122575759888,0.9940245115903088,Positive
Okay. Thank you for that concept Liz. And then maybe as a follow up either for you or for Jeff just with regard to your comments on the trends youre seeing so far in the first quarter here. Can you maybe just help us conceptualize in your view is this more specific to this quarter given the various factors such as COVID that you mentioned here or with regard to historical practice and in this population on the commercial side Is this more reflective you think of typical seasonality in the Medicare population and doughnut holes and put those kinds of factors Any clarity on that point would be great,URGN,0.9999918937683104,0.9999837875269575,Positive
Yeah. Jeff you want to comment and maybe Ill add something after.,URGN,0.933844029903412,0.8676879809427149,Positive
Sure. No. That  we have a very small number patients of Medicare that dont have supplemental. I dont think thats a great impact as much so as weve seen with sort of prioritizing the vaccine both from a patient standpoint and a hospital or provider standpoint.,URGN,0.9750497341156006,0.9500994384881487,Positive
We  the good thing is the majority accounts that were  that we had out there are the accounts that were pushing off formulary view are now reviewing. Things are starting to get back to normal within the provider. But I  theres a very minimal impact with regards to out of pocket because majority of our patients have supplemental insurance.,URGN,0.7948286533355713,0.589657062087692,Positive
Yeah. And just,URGN,0.7573657631874084,0.5147312371320947,Positive
Okay.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
comment about the trends. We dont think that it will continue that way. As a matter of fact as Molly mentioned weve already seen it start rebounding in March. So it made sense that these patients and the physicians one now that the vaccines available wait a few weeks get the vaccine.,URGN,0.8821760416030884,0.7643519427489893,Positive
Theres tons of publications out there and literature out there that says that across the Board hospitals around the country institutions around the country are doing that. Not just obviously in this instance but across the Board.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And so we dont expect to see that trend continue and as Jeff said we think well be in a good position. So for us the outlook on the year hasnt changed at all right Its just more timing thing.,URGN,0.9535118341445924,0.9070236128709395,Positive
Okay. Thanks for the call Liz and congratulations again.,URGN,0.99328351020813,0.9865670124095756,Positive
Great. Thank you.,URGN,0.9971423149108888,0.9942846264151495,Positive
Thank you. Operator Instructions Our next question comes from line of Ram Selvaraju from H.C. Wainwright. Your question please.,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning. This is Mark ph speaking on behalf of Ram. Thanks for taking our questions. I have a couple of COVID impact questions and then two followup. First on the Jelmyto sales effort being conductive in the context of COVID19 do you anticipate being able to conduct same promotional activities in the coming months that you werent able to perform previously And because the COVID19 pandemic is progressing ph down and then in terms of the ATLAS trial enrollment you mentioned you expect to provide enrollment update there I mean  but I mean do you see any logistical challenge in execution of the trial due to COVID19 and if so what are they using how are you mitigating that Thanks.,URGN,0.9983878135681152,0.9967756252143534,Positive
Yeah. Ill comment about the study. I would say not really we anticipated that there would likely be delay so our expectations for enrollment. Were obviously  from an amount of enrollment obviously it starts slow anyway.,URGN,0.7509099245071411,0.5018195520755959,Positive
We did make sure that we sort of around the world doing the study. There were a couple of countries that that delay started the study but then there were other countries that didnt. And so well continue to work through that.,URGN,0.7797765731811523,0.5595528838353656,Positive
But we felt like we have enough sites and is one of the reasons that we actually increase the number of sites versus our initial expectation because we wanted to make sure that with COVID if a country or area shutdown that we would be able to sort of makeup that enrollment elsewhere. So and then Jeff do you want to comment on promotion,URGN,0.933198094367981,0.8663961091018373,Positive
Sure. So what weve seen is an increase in facetoface interactions. I was fortunate to get out with some accounts last week a couple weeks ago and the facetoface is improving. So theyre opening up to facetoface interactions. And more importantly they open up to have representatives come in and do presentations over lunch. So a lot of places that have limited lunches or facetoface interaction are slowly beginning to open those interactions up.,URGN,0.9963248372077942,0.9926496700344503,Positive
Where thats still limited we continue. The field does an excellent job of continuing to have virtual reminders virtual presentations with the physicians being mindful and respectful of what the office prefers at this time. But I am happy to say that yes theres more facetoface that are taking place I can  I see that continuing as COVID cases go down.,URGN,0.9937522411346436,0.9875044748213737,Positive
Okay. Excellent. And do you expect the difference between the number of sites activated and the number of sites they have treated more than one patient with Jelmyto to narrow substantially over the course of the next several quarters And if not why do you think that why not,URGN,0.999259352684021,0.9985187044851211,Positive
No. I expect both to grow. I mean I think someone asked a question to the  we want all of our sites activated treating more than one patient. I mean we want to get to the point where physicians are opening it up. Weve had that too. You have initially you obviously have a champion in the office. But they ask and the goal of the reps  representatives are to go in and open it up to the other physician. So you have it.,URGN,0.8643044233322144,0.7286086849025994,Positive
So I expect both numbers to continue to grow as weve got a large number of accounts that either putting it on formulary have it on formulary looking for a patient and then once they experience using Jelmyto with the patient either finding more patients or certainly that that peertopeer influence that I talked about discussing it with other physicians during their all of these accounts have tumor boards or medical meetings with their urologist. Making sure that were part of that agenda is a key goal for us to get the majority of the urologists within an account considering Jelmyto for their patients.,URGN,0.9999811053276062,0.9999622106326882,Positive
Okay. Great. And then just the final two housekeeping questions. So are there any timeframe restrictions on the funding received from RTW investments So in other words does RTW have right to impose additional conditions or require additional consideration of the 300 million amounts not paid back within a specific period of time And will are these additional commissions if any so if funding from RTW secured by any of UroGens IP tax,URGN,0.926393747329712,0.8527874069138808,Positive
Molly,URGN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Maybe  yeah. Sure. To answer that theres no timeframe commitment in the event that 300 million is achieved over certain period time. So that theres no  to answer that question theres no time commitment. As far as collateral certainly they have a security main interest on the strip of Jelmyto. And then thats carved out within the IP interest as well but certainly nothing that we believe would prohibit us to look at exU.S. or other BB tech activities in these products.,URGN,0.9999948143959044,0.9999896287856271,Positive
Perfect. Makes sense. Thanks for taking my questions.,URGN,0.9996160268783568,0.9992320532989818,Positive
Great. Thank you.,URGN,0.9971423149108888,0.9942846264151495,Positive
Thank you. This does conclude the questionandanswer session of todays program. Id like to hand the program back to Liz Barrett for any further remarks.,URGN,0.8779435157775879,0.7558868860524213,Positive
Great. Thank you Operator. As we look back in 2020 were really pleased with what we were able to accomplish both with our first approved medicine as well as significant progress made in our pipeline. Its an exciting time in our company and were committed to ensuring that patients that need our medicines have access to them. As we look to the other side of the pandemic hopefully we look forward to continue a dialogue with you and as we advance our long term growth strategy in 2021 and beyond. As always we appreciate your support and interest in our company and thanks for taking the time today. Operator you can disconnect the call at this time. Thank you.,URGN,1.0,1.0,Positive
Thank you. And thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in todays conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.,URGN,0.9994109869003296,0.9988219730985004,Positive
Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by and welcome to the Agenus Fourth Quarter 2020 Conference Call and Webcast. At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode. Operator Instructions After todays presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Operator Instructions Please note that this event is being recorded and may be used in future Agenus promotional material.,AGEN,0.9999979734420776,0.9999959468817394,Positive
I would now like to turn the conference over to Jan Medina Director of Investor Relations. Jan please go ahead.,AGEN,0.9722152352333068,0.9444304373445731,Positive
Thanks Liz and thank you all for joining us today. Todays call is being webcast and we will be available on our website for replay. Before we start I just want to quickly introduce myself. I know Ive spoken with a number of you already over the last month or so but I started here at Agenus back in February. I would help lead the Investor Relations efforts. Certainly its a very promising time for the company. Im looking forward to being part of the conversations were having with the investment community.,AGEN,0.9999986886978148,0.9999973773940665,Positive
With that said I just want to remind you that this call will include forwardlooking statements including statements regarding our clinical development regulatory and commercial plans and time lines as well as time lines for data release and partnership opportunities. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and we refer you to our SEC filings for more details on these risks. As a reminder this call is being recorded for audio broadcast.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Joining me today are Dr. Garo Armen Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jennifer Buell President and Chief Operating Officer Andy Hurley Chief Commercial Officer and Christine Klaskin Vice President of Finance.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Also available during the questionandanswer session will be Dr. Steven ODay our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. ODay joined Agenus earlier this year as well along with a number of other key hires and brings clinical development expertise to Agenus at this pivotal time.,AGEN,0.9910987615585328,0.9821975125059563,Positive
Now Ill turn the call over to Garo to highlight our key accomplishments and our goals for 2021. Garo,AGEN,0.9622951745986938,0.9245903042497063,Positive
Good morning. Thank you very much. In 2020 our pipeline continued to grow with an arsenal of agents designed to activate the immune system across different types of patients and cancers on one hand while also addressing immunotherapy resistance pathways across many tumor types and the other.,AGEN,0.99998939037323,0.9999787807338123,Positive
We expect these advances will contribute to the IO field on multiple fronts. For instance we are advancing AGEN1181s clinical development and generating responses in patients who are unlikely to otherwise respond to immunotherapy.,AGEN,0.7925626039505005,0.5851249606162074,Positive
We expect to advance AGEN1181 to registrational studies this year. Weve also made substantial advances with our TIGIT programs demonstrating the unique attributes of our bispecific antibody which is INDready.,AGEN,0.9127048254013062,0.8254095467385929,Positive
One of our notable achievements during 2020 was the completion of patient enrollment and data analysis of our two most clinically advanced agents balstilimab which is our PD1 antibody and zalifrelimab which is our firstgeneration CTLA4 antibody. We call these bal and zal for short.,AGEN,0.2288571000099182,-0.5422867192546841,Negative
We are progressing with the completion of our BLA filing for bal and will proceed with our strategy regarding the potential bal plus zal filing once bals BLA filing has been accepted. It is our aim to use balstilimab as the foundation for several of our pipeline agents as well as offer our bal for use with therapies from other companies which require combination with a PD1 blocker. Our objective is to rapidly enable synergistic combinations to advance the field.,AGEN,0.9980026483535768,0.9960052943261235,Positive
Synergistic combinations for our agents include cell therapies through our subsidiary AgenTus. While we are continuing our allogeneic intelligent iNKT cell therapy in patients with COVID19 we will be advancing these intelligent cells into cancer trials with combinations around midyear.,AGEN,0.9939197301864624,0.9878394531246741,Positive
Separately at a time when the worlds need for higher quantities of vaccine production grows we are advancing our plans for producing high quantities of QS21 adjuvant from a renewable source.,AGEN,0.981431245803833,0.962862469471973,Positive
QS21 is an antigensparing adjuvant. What that means is that a vaccine formulation with QS21 may require as little as 100fold less antigen to achieve the same immune response.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
If this proves to be the case for some or most COVID19 vaccines you can appreciate the potential implications of QS21 to be able to significantly increase global COVID19 manufacturing capacity  that is vaccine manufacturing capacity without the need to add additional antigen production capabilities which is one of the major bottlenecks of today.,AGEN,0.8265829086303711,0.6531656105313364,Positive
Several of these advancements I touched upon represent important milestones. We expect some of those to result in cash accretive corporate transactions starting in the second quarter of this year.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In 2020 we built on Agenus foundation of innovation and integration. These are  that is innovation and integration are the key pillars of our business model. While COVID has posed challenges for many including Agenus we were early to anticipate and adjust to life in the very early stages of the pandemic.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Weve also rapidly adjusted to address new needs such as iNKT cell therapy in patients with more severe infections of COVID19 who are dependent on life support. We published early data from the trial and expect to share more as our trial matures. Our teams are also preparing for the scenario of a rapid or emergency use path for iNKT cell therapy should the trial data look encouraging.,AGEN,0.0893970727920532,-0.8212069399398207,Negative
But with all these adjustments our whole mission is unchanged. We will continue to innovate and advance our programs with speed. This requires integrated capabilities to reduce our dependence on outsiders on one hand but also very importantly retaining and continuing to acquire high talent.,AGEN,0.8338186740875244,0.6676371500713527,Positive
High talent density is key to our ability to deliver innovation. Recently we welcomed stunning talent into our leadership team and I will start with Dr. Steven ODay our Chief Medical Officer and our Chief Commercial Officer Andy Hurley. These two professionals are among some of the most respected names in the field.,AGEN,0.9999663829803468,0.999932765920619,Positive
Dr. ODay is a pioneer in immunooncology and as a clinical investigator he has been an important contributor to the success weve seen so far with AGEN1181. As we advance in the discovery and development of highperforming immune therapies and particularly combinations we need to have formidable players like Dr. ODay on our team.,AGEN,0.9277591705322266,0.8555182549466223,Positive
Dr. ODay played a key role in the successful development of Yervoy and Opdivo CTLA4 and PD1 agents as well as several other cancer therapies. He has the knowledge and expertise to build on our work with 1181 cemented in place in the IO landscape and fully maximize the compounds potential as a blockbuster therapy for cancer patients.,AGEN,0.9735733270645142,0.9471466226259604,Positive
We have big plans for AGEN1181 and well pursue accelerated pathways to advance the molecule to the market. Andy Hurley will be a key driver of our aspirations to do this. In his role as Chief Commercial Officer Andy joined us after three decades of building teams and commercializing product in biopharma. With the balstilimab BLA filing expected in the first half of this year Andy will help establish Agenus as a commercial company with balstilimab as a key actor in our plans for our ambitious combination strategies.,AGEN,0.999603271484375,0.9992065424958125,Positive
Given our mission to develop impactful combinations for patients Agenus requires clinical scientists with extensive and established expertise. Dr. Joe Grossman joined our team as Head of Exploratory Medicine from Harvard and Beth Israel. His specialty includes colorectal and pancreatic cancers. Dr. Grossman will drive our translational medicine strategy which is a key aspect of Agenus clinical development strategy.,AGEN,0.8998830318450928,0.799765944341388,Positive
Dr. Jason Paragas another recent addition to our team is an expert in data analysis and artificial intelligence. He formerly served with DARPA working on threat detection for the U.S. government and associated defense departments. Jason joined us as Vice President of Strategic Initiatives. Jason will also be working with our team to industrialize and broaden the applications of our VISION response prediction technology. Next Adam Krauss joined as Chief Legal and Compliance Officer to ensure our commercial readiness and Marc Wiles joined as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
It is a transformative period for Agenus and the value each of these team members bring will help drive a new level of success for the company. We understand the ambitious scale of our mission as we seek to disrupt an industry that has been challenged with disruptive demands. We believe marshalling the best people and resources is paramount to achieving success.,AGEN,0.9990744590759276,0.9981489170485238,Positive
I would now like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Operating Officer Dr. Jennifer Buell.,AGEN,0.9460643529891968,0.8921286416820535,Positive
Thank you Garo. As Garo indicated our RD engine has been enormously productive with numerous discoveries IND filings and product candidates advancing in latestage trials. As a result 2020 was a period of significant data flow. We presented data updates on our programs at all of the leading oncology conferences last year. At SITC AACR and ASCO we presented data on clinical responses with 1181 as well as the differentiation of our five lead molecules. And finally we also presented data on our response predictive  prediction platform VISION.,AGEN,0.9995182752609252,0.9990365499475893,Positive
With our TIGIT bispecific AGEN1777 we presented data revealing the potential to broaden the activity beyond first generation of antiTIGIT antibodies. Weve engineered an important region of the molecule the Fc region to improve responses expand the population of responders and generate monotherapy activity which is not currently seen with TIGIT monospecific antibodies available today.,AGEN,0.2435693144798278,-0.512862272776528,Negative
More recently at ESMO just a few months ago we presented preliminary data from the balstilimab monotherapy and balzal combination studies showing breakthrough activity in PDL1 positive and PDL1 negative cervical cancer patients. As we look into 2021 including AACR next month we will continue our aggressive approach to data presentation providing clinical updates on our lead compounds including AGEN1181.,AGEN,0.7889893054962158,0.577978359447932,Positive
On our BLA filings our rolling BLA filing for balstilimab monotherapy in secondline cervical cancer is underway. Initiated in September we expect to complete the filing during the first half of this year. And as we disclosed in September this timeline accommodates two additional late confirmed responders seen in our pivotal trial. Well provide the FDA with six months of followup on those patients as well as 12month median followup on all trial participants. We believe balstilimabs approval would represent a meaningful new option for the cervical cancer community.,AGEN,0.8128554821014404,0.6257107411090976,Positive
We note that pembrolizumab KEYTRUDA is approved in the PDL1 positive population only and shows no clinical responses in PDL1 negative tumors. And in the largest IO clinical trial in this population to date in over 160 patients treated with balstilimab alone we reported response rates of 19 in PDL1 positive patients and 10 in PDL1 negative patients. This compares favorably to KEYTRUDA which has 14 responses in PDL1 positive tumors and no responses in PDL1 negative tumors.,AGEN,0.0141277015209198,-0.9717457722102238,Negative
In addition the durability of response in our pivotal trial was impressive lasting approximately 15.4 months. This is not observed with chemotherapeutic options currently available for these patients.,AGEN,0.8205361366271973,0.6410720593166706,Positive
The duration of response is a hallmark of effective IO agents and ours far exceeds the limited duration of response observed with chemotherapy for these patients. We believe these clinical data reveal emerging differential features of balstilimab.,AGEN,0.0340065658092498,-0.9319880199360968,Negative
We plan to publish the full clinical data set of balstilimab in refractory cervical cancer in a highprofile journal. Additionally we will publish preclinical data from our vision platform that further elucidates bals superior tumor cell killing capabilities compared to the leading commercially available PD1 antibodies.,AGEN,0.055450826883316,-0.8890994722243979,Negative
Regarding our plans for the balstilimab plus zalifrelimab BLA filing weve been in ongoing discussions with the FDA. The trial has completed enrollment. The patients have concluded the median of 12 months of followup. And were collecting data on late responses in this trial as well.,AGEN,0.9280849695205688,0.8561698533116897,Positive
The data continues to improve as it matures with response rates and most importantly duration of those responses. Agenus will continue to keep the agency informed of additional data advancements. And as Garo just discussed we plan to disclose the timing and strategy regarding bal and zal once bals FDA filing has been accepted.,AGEN,0.8268227577209473,0.6536453089984113,Positive
Our first approval with balstilimab would mark a strategic milestone for Agenus. Having our own approved PD1 inhibitor would allow us the freedom and flexibility for the development and commercial pricing of our combination regimens with our own IO compounds including CTLA4 TIGIT and novel molecules targeting myeloid pathways and beyond.,AGEN,0.9993815422058104,0.9987630836743613,Positive
In addition we see a significant opportunity with our PD1 in combination with potential partnered programs. Regarding 1181 to the emerging clinical profile of 1181 again this is also an engineered antibody.,AGEN,0.9727736711502076,0.9455473098440828,Positive
Weve engineered the Fc region of the antibody to improve its features. We designed 1181 for superior efficacy with improved T cell priming and the capability to deplete suppressive intratumoral regulatory T cells.,AGEN,0.9200468063354492,0.8400935173592075,Positive
Weve also designed the molecule for better safety avoiding complementmediated toxicities and to broaden the patient population who can benefit from CTLA4. Thats because of improved binding to CD16. And were seeing activity in patients with both the low affinity and the highaffinity CD16 allele.,AGEN,0.8006305694580078,0.6012609012489922,Positive
We believe AGEN1181 continues to show nothing less than extraordinary promise as a differentiated antiCTLA4. This potential is upheld in the new data Agenus announced early in February that describes new confirmed responses.,AGEN,0.975092589855194,0.9501851500184235,Positive
As of February a total of six confirmed responses with 1181 monotherapy and 1181 plus bal have been recorded  reported in colon ovarian and endometrial cancers including two complete responses.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Further weve seen responses in cold tumors. These are tumors that have low tumor mutational burden microsatellite stable disease and PDL1 negative tumors as well as BRCA negative tumors and tumors with a low affinity CD16 allele.,AGEN,0.0055639743804931,-0.9888732366998416,Negative
This is what makes 1181 unique. These are tumors where current IO therapy is largely ineffective. In addition no debilitating neuroendocrine toxicities or liver toxicities have been observed unlike what we see in patients treated with Yervoy experiencing 10 to 15 toxicities.,AGEN,0.9891634583473206,0.978326903776469,Positive
Looking ahead with 1181 currently in Phase 2 development our goal is a fasttomarket strategy targeting indications that currently have few effective treatments. And in patients who have failed prior standard therapies.,AGEN,0.9814419746398926,0.9628839271568819,Positive
Trials are continuing with 1181 alone and in combination with balstilimab with expanded cohorts in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer microsatellite stable endometrial cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer and melanoma.,AGEN,0.0187166929244995,-0.962567783932557,Negative
With continued positive clinical data a registrational program expected to begin by the end of this year and its with great excitement that we brought on board Dr. Steven ODay an expert in delivering effective IO agents to patients with cancer.,AGEN,0.9359320402145386,0.8718640040540719,Positive
AGEN1181 alone and as the backbone of highimpact combination could be a foundational therapy if approved driving the next wave of IO treatments. Our initial registrational plan will focus on indications for rapid launch through the accelerated approval pathway as a monotherapy or on top of our PD1 or any approved PD1.,AGEN,0.8706245422363281,0.7412489302450003,Positive
Based on our preclinical and clinical data todate our ambitions with 1181 plus PD1 are to be the dominant IO combination with the potential to overtake Yervoy and Opdivo or chemo and KEYTRUDA as the market leader. Were actively seeking the right partner to execute this strategy and dominate in this sector.,AGEN,0.991301417350769,0.9826028243320133,Positive
At the upcoming AACR conference in April well present two abstracts featuring AGEN1181 alone and in combination with other IO mechanisms such as our antiPD1 therapy balstilimab. Well showcase how the unique design of this molecule is expanding the benefit of this important target to drive responses in all polymorphic variants and the ability to provide clinical benefit in previously unresponsive tumors.,AGEN,0.987156629562378,0.9743132438142563,Positive
Well also show the benefit of adding 1181 to other checkpoint inhibitors such as antiPD1 antiTIGIT iNKTactivating therapy and adoptive Tcell therapy. Novel IO combinations will drive the next wave of IO therapy and Agenus believe that 1181 alone and in combination with other mechanisms is the foundation of this next wave.,AGEN,0.9894390106201172,0.9788780086505464,Positive
Lets turn now for a moment to work on TIGIT. Not unlike CTLA4 and PD1 TIGIT is one of the key components in our immune system its found on T cells and by suppressing unnecessary activity like the activation of T cells it helps keep the immune system properly balanced. Usually TIGIT is invaluable to good health but in cancer patients TIGITs suppression of the immune system allows tumors to grow.,AGEN,0.7842051982879639,0.5684101393283243,Positive
An important finding is that treatment with PD1 actually upregulates TIGIT consequently curbing the activity of TIGIT often using antibodies has become an area of intense RD efforts and antiTIGIT therapy is set to be another breakthrough in IO. Agenus has two antiTIGIT antibodies. This is AGEN1327 a monospecific antibody thats also engineered like AGEN1181 to improve performance.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And AGEN1777 a bispecific antibody that includes a TIGIT arm that has also been engineered for Fc enhancement. As a potentially bestinclass agents were prioritizing AGEN1777 for advancement into the clinic and expect to begin human studies this year. What makes AGEN1777 potential bestinclass Similar to 1181 weve designed the front end of 1777 for strong receptor binding in this case to TIGIT.,AGEN,0.9978420734405518,0.995684144308653,Positive
Weve also engineered the Fc backend for improved T cell and NK cell activation in order to more effectively unleash the immune system. Weve gone one step further with 1777 by engineering it as a bispecific antibody cotargeting a second tumor escape mechanism to create a double blockade against cancer escape. This dual blockade is designed to address a potential alternate escape mechanism to TIGIT therapy.,AGEN,0.0060770511627197,-0.9878470825237529,Negative
Overall we believe the combination of our Fc enhanced and cotargeting with our AGEN1777 bispecific gives it bestinclass potential. And as Garo mentioned potentially provides strong efficacy not just in combination with other IO mechanisms but also uniquely as a single agent. Some of this has already been demonstrated in preclinical tumor models and we eagerly anticipate clinical trials initiation this year.,AGEN,0.8003644347190857,0.6007286314538904,Positive
Our TIGIT strategy was also recently featured in our first episode of Agenus insights. This is our new RD miniseries that provides insight into impactful areas of research and Agenus contributions to immunooncology. We encourage you to watch the replay and stay tuned for more episodes in the coming months.,AGEN,0.9933747053146362,0.9867494027313011,Positive
Through our AgenTus subsidiary weve developed a platform to produce invariant natural killer T cells or iNKTs. iNKTs are type of selfdirected intelligent immune cells capable of producing responses from both the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune system.,AGEN,0.9649589657783508,0.9299178897845088,Positive
iNKTs can combat multiple disease threats in an autonomous manner. In inflammatory disorders iNKTs has helped to restore the balance of the immune system correcting conditions like the cytokine storm that we see in patients with severe cases of COVID19.,AGEN,0.052719235420227,-0.8945626584068886,Negative
Earlier this year we announced preliminary Phase 1 data from our COVID trial currently ongoing. Dose escalation for an initiation into a Phase 2 trial is on track for the first half of this year and data readouts are expected in the fourth quarter.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Now in cancer iNKTs homing on tissues and direct the killing of tumor cells. They have an invariant TCR receptor. It doesnt need to be engineered to them. This will counter immune suppressor cells and block tumor escape mechanisms.,AGEN,0.9370989799499512,0.8741978849159986,Positive
You can imagine the benefit of this homing feature we observe in lung tissue in the infectious disease setting to be very impactful in diseases like lung cancer. And as the cell therapy iNKTs has the potential to be used on their own and in combination with additional anticancer therapies such as those already in our pipeline.,AGEN,0.0732773542404174,-0.8534463962593057,Negative
AgenTus first iNKT Phase 1 trial in cancer is anticipated to start dosing during the first half of this year and were targeting human studies to be initiated in solid tumors soon thereafter.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And lastly while we often discuss our IO pipeline compounds in isolation theres clearly tremendous value in the combination potential for the cancer pathways were targeting.,AGEN,0.9055177569389344,0.8110354012461911,Positive
PD1 CTLA4 TIGIT iNKT therapy and other promising mechanisms and programs we have not yet discussed on this call. Stay tuned for more on these exciting developments in the balance of this year.,AGEN,0.8365613222122192,0.6731224495902357,Positive
Ill now turn the call over to our Chief Commercial Officer Andy Hurley to elaborate on our excitement regarding AGEN1181.,AGEN,0.979012966156006,0.9580259072935031,Positive
Thank you Jen. My decision to join the Agenus team was driven by the excitement we all feel and the opportunities we have here under one roof. Im also driven by our nearterm prospects which I believe could create substantial value.,AGEN,0.9807523488998412,0.9615046748546805,Positive
Im particularly excited by how we can take our PD1 balstilimab and potentially grow it into a major franchise with a superior combination potential with AGEN1181. I believe 1181 will significantly expand the commercial opportunity of our antiPD1 with the potential to outperform current IO combinations.,AGEN,0.9998223781585692,0.9996447561053965,Positive
The clinical results to date have been very exciting both as a monotherapy and in combinations across a wide array of tumor types. Specifically as Jen said cold tumors such as microsatellite stable tumors represent a significant portion within colorectal and endometrial cancers.,AGEN,0.0674987435340881,-0.8650036245606093,Negative
And traditional PD1 antiCTLA4 inhibitor therapies have not been as effective here. These are tumors which dont generally respond to cancer immunotherapy and yet we are seeing responses with AGEN1181.,AGEN,0.1132401227951049,-0.77352081151057,Negative
Practically and conceptually were not limited to any tumor type if the current response trends we are seeing continue. Its really a function of picky patients certifications which can get us to the finish line quickly and leverage this to expand on our broader opportunities.,AGEN,0.8499370813369751,0.6998739837849044,Positive
Having our own PD1 to pair with our superior CTLA4 and then having our own unique CTLA4 which can add significant value to our PD1 are advantages which are very exciting for us to pursue.,AGEN,0.9995874762535096,0.9991749520152524,Positive
And then theres the rest of our pipeline including our intelligent cell therapy program our vaccines and exciting pipeline of antibodies with compelling early data. I feel the privilege of working with an exceptional team of people across all disciplines.,AGEN,0.997283101081848,0.9945661989248982,Positive
I have worked at highly successful companies but what we have here is very unique and exciting. I hope to interact with you more frequently and do a deeper dive on our commercial strategy to create something exceptional.,AGEN,0.9997773170471193,0.9995546338287795,Positive
I appreciate the opportunity to express my plans. And Ill now turn the call over to Christine Klaskin to review our financials.,AGEN,0.8884521722793579,0.7769042115832636,Positive

QuestionandAnswer Session,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Biren Amin with Jefferies.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah. Hey guys. This is Jeet on for Biren. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the progress to date. Im looking forward to updates this year. Could you just maybe walk me through the timing perhaps between the bal BLA filing and when you actually anticipate submitting the combo and perhaps when ultimate approval is perhaps expected there And then second just if you could talk through perhaps some of your gotomarket efforts to this point and any goals for the remainder of this year and if theres any color on discussions with payers or thoughts on pricing that would be great. Thank you.,AGEN,1.0,1.0,Positive
Thank you Biren. Let me start out addressing the balzal question. As you know and as we sort of alluded to as data matures looking at our past performance with data disclosures were delighted to see that the data is getting better. And I think given the size of our company and given the enormous demands on us for regulatory undertakings weve made a decision several months ago which we articulated to the investment community that our first priority is to file our BLA with balstilimab. And once thats done we will provide additional guidance for our timelines associated with our balzal filing. And of course that will include disclosure of more mature data which were in the process of addressing both from a public disclosure perspective as well as disclosing it to the agency.,AGEN,0.992250680923462,0.9845013526090103,Positive
Got it.,AGEN,0.9141947627067566,0.8283894231256383,Positive
As to gotomarket strategy Im assuming youre talking about gotoproduct market strategy. And with that I think Andy are you prepared to give us some initial remarks,AGEN,0.998348832130432,0.9966976622925174,Positive
Sure. Yes its a good question. Ive been here in a limited amount of time but I can tell you that the launch planning is underway. Were really evaluating how were going to really address the unmet needs in the marketplace and position this product in a way that addresses those unmet needs both at a physician level as well as on a patient level.,AGEN,0.996985137462616,0.9939702713312335,Positive
At the patient level you bring up the question on pricing and access thats going to be one of our absolute paramount priorities is just to ensure unencumbered access to balstilimab as we look at the landscape that thats going to follow. We look at this as a pivotal part in our relationship with payers because we dont believe this is going to be of course our first and only into the marketplace.,AGEN,0.9438075423240662,0.8876150176614628,Positive
We want to be able to follow on with other products and establishing those relationships and making sure that they understand our goals which is unencumbered patient access is going to be really key. So were going to be starting those discussions with payers. Weve done a lot of market research to understand really what are the drivers to position our product and were really encouraged by what were hearing to be able to offer that in a setting both at the physician and patient level.,AGEN,0.9999394416809082,0.9998788832896253,Positive
So I can tell you that Im week four into the role. And ultimately Im very encouraged by the level of effort thats already been put in and our planning moving forward.,AGEN,0.9748778343200684,0.9497556386921637,Positive
Got it. And if I could just ask one more followup question. On 1181 it seems like the AACR presentation will be fairly preclinical in nature. Just wanted to know if we can anticipate perhaps a robust clinical update on that perhaps later this year and if well maybe get us a look at that Phase 2 data in colorectal Thanks.,AGEN,0.9999240636825562,0.9998481272745892,Positive
Hi Jeet. Thanks for the question. Actually AACR certainly will include some preclinical information but of course we will also provide a clinical update on where we are with the programs so stay tuned for more on that.,AGEN,0.9999996423721312,0.9999992847438361,Positive
Our next question comes from Mayank Mamtani with B. Riley Securities.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning team. Appreciate the comprehensive update and thanks for taking my questions and great to have Dr. ODay and Andy be part of the discussion. So maybe just piggybacking on the previous question on the upcoming 1181 clinical data at AACR would you also have more updated cutoff relative to February 9 Could you just clarify that And maybe Dr. ODay if you could comment on why MSS colorectal indication kind of makes the first to pursue as you think about fast ph to market Can you just talk about the dynamics of that indication,AGEN,0.9999693632125854,0.999938726388649,Positive
So before I turn it over to Dr. ODay Mayank thanks for your question. At AACR yes we will have a more mature data than what weve previously disclosed and this will include more information on duration as well as potential new responses in the program too. Now Ill turn it over to Dr. ODay to give you his thinking on MSS colorectal cancer.,AGEN,0.9766035079956056,0.9532069881004026,Positive
Steven ODay,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Mayank. Well as Jenny said Im new to the company in recent months but I have had the unique opportunity to be involved with 1181 over the course of the last several years both in learning about its exciting clinical drug design as well as preclinical data and then obviously being involved as the principal investigator in the 1181 Phase 1 trial.,AGEN,0.9075461030006408,0.815092095787582,Positive
Whats exciting to me is the preclinical data of more activity and Treg depletion as well as more potential access to low affinity CD16 alleles all seems to be playing out so far in the clinic with our Phase I trial.,AGEN,0.096497893333435,-0.8070052903922145,Negative
As you can imagine with the competitive nature and approvals across IO indications in solid tumors Phase I trials attract fairly cold tumors that are MSstable and theres no surprise that our trial has attracted those patients particularly colorectal endometrial MS stable ovarian and others.,AGEN,0.9821895360946656,0.9643790509575911,Positive
And whats exciting to me is to see objective responses obviously in both 1181 monotherapy in combinations in these cold tumors that are predominantly PDL1 negative MS stable low tumor burden and interestingly in CD16 lower heterozygous affinity polymorphisms which is all consistent with preclinical data.,AGEN,0.7823489308357239,0.564697602211,Positive
So given that fact obviously Im excited to be part of the development of this drug as we go forward. And colorectal MS stable cohorts are clearly a huge unmet need with a low bar in the second and thirdline setting.,AGEN,0.9936612844467164,0.9873225613370906,Positive
So were going to follow the data and expand these cohorts in cold tumors as well as look at our warmtohot tumors both lung and then cutaneous tumors melanoma and nonmelanoma cutaneous skin tumors are real opportunities for us to look both at this agent and single agent as well as combination. So its going to be exciting coming year for me and my clinical team to develop this very exciting drug.,AGEN,0.8706068992614746,0.7412136442742612,Positive
Fantastic. Thats very helpful. And then on  two quick ones for Jen and I have one more for Garo to close. Jen what would be the path for QS21 just from a clinical development standpoint And also on the TIGIT bispecific when do you expect disclosing the other target youre working on,AGEN,0.9996981620788574,0.9993963237978958,Positive
So Mayank Im here. So let me start with TIGIT disclosing. As you can imagine this is an incredibly competitive space. We have a bispecific that is a first of its kind we believe and its designed really to address an entirely new area. So we will not be disclosing that anytime soon but well certainly keep you informed as the data continue to progress both preclinically and then clinically and that may drive our decision on disclosures.,AGEN,0.9998652935028076,0.9997305868450326,Positive
For QS21 the development is really straightforward. So as you know Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation had invested in our initiative to advance a sustainable supply of QS21. Weve done so were in the process of doing so but weve already generated early data and demonstrated the biocomparability of this new supply compared to the previous clinic version which is now in the approved Shingrix vaccine as you know.,AGEN,0.2084464430809021,-0.5831080574441299,Negative
So the development is straightforward. Its preclinical comparability. And then the clinical program will be very abbreviated to bring this product into market with a number of vaccine products underway. And particularly at this time when we see the criticality of effective vaccines we know that historical vaccines no longer cut it. Flu vaccines at 30 efficacy just wont do it. So we need to improve our ability to take antigens allow for mass global production of those and this is where QS21 is really critical at antigen sparing allowing a fewer number or lower amount of antigens to actually be quite effective. As you see with Shingrix its over 90 up to 97 effective in adults and gets better with age. These are the kinds of findings that were going to need across the board as we deal with these mutating viruses repeatedly.,AGEN,0.8387250304222107,0.6774498685895614,Positive
Okay. Very helpful. So I think a number of different disease indications that you may consider including flu including COVID even Shingrix. Understood. Then last for Garo as you think about the cash accretive transactions just can you just high level talk to the framework that you guys are kind of evaluating internally. When you think about prosecuting these opportunities across the board more advanced latestage versus earlier stage programs Kind of how do you think about a lot of push and pull that might be associated with these transactions,AGEN,0.9973299503326416,0.994659897482334,Positive
Right. So all I can tell you right now is stay tuned. As I said in the second quarter starting in the second quarter we will see cashaccretive transactions including corporate transactions. So unfortunately I cannot disclose anything more than that right now.,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.,AGEN,0.9795445799827576,0.9590891355807398,Positive

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So this morning Sanofi and Regeneron announced positive Phase III results of Libtayo in cervical cancer. I know you guys had previously kind of hinted at meeting to get that accelerated approval BLA in before a full approval was there. I assume given you guys are close to finishing the bal BLA that the Phase III positive results arent going to affect that at this point but just wanted to confirm.,AGEN,0.1717880964279174,-0.6564247944502799,Negative
Hi Matt. Thanks for the question. Yes I agree with you. So the accelerated approval pathway remains open until full approval is granted in the same indication. Based on where we are with our filing we dont believe this will impact our plans.,AGEN,0.99617338180542,0.992346759049153,Positive
MattPhipps,AGEN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Now I would like to give you more color on the 5 quarteroverquarter decline in the number of students in class in the fourth quarter of 2020. Firstly from what we have observed during the COVID19 pandemic offline education remains the top priority for many parents which is also our core business under the OMO model due to the cumulative impact from the closure of our selfowned learning centers during the first three quarters of 2020 our new students enrollment number was lower than the normal levels.,REDU,0.030690461397171,-0.9386202327133613,Negative
Secondly online experience was not as good as offline learning. Our retention rate saw a decline compared with 2019 as some parents choose not to retain courses for their children during the pandemic slowed down.,REDU,0.0130741000175476,-0.9738529764729598,Negative
Thirdly with offline classes resumed a large number of students completed their courses and graduate from RISE. Therefore total outflow of students is larger than inflow. New students enrolled need to wait for classes to start. These factors altogether impacted the total number of student in class at the end of Q4 2020.,REDU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
However this should be a shortterm phenomenon as new student enrollments continued to gain strong traction with healthy growth over the last two quarters and onward plus the retention rate is trending up in the fourth quarter we believe the number of students in offline classrooms will recover very soon in the first half of 2021.,REDU,0.1740241944789886,-0.6519525956824993,Negative
Now on to slide five as the COVID19 epidemic continues to ease in China almost all of our learning centers resumed normal operations in the fourth quarter.

Im proud to say that we have done quite well on the part of new students inflow in the quarter four.

Thank you for taking my question. Im Lauren from Credit Suisse. I have two questions on behalf of Alex. The first one is about the student acquisition costs.

Okay. I can start and then Warren can add more insights. For customer acquisition costs as you mentioned Lauren we see here is competition from our online channels. So the strategy for us is to continue to use our offline channels and the wage for the leads to be generated through offline channels continue to increase. The overall percentage is already close to 70. So 70 of the leads coming from our offline learning center promotions and offline activities.,REDU,0.9406528472900392,0.881305623832717,Positive
We think well continue to focus on offline this year. And of course the fourth quarter number is very encouraging but I think the full year 2021 the acquisition cost will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. But I dont think well use the expensive channels to  will hopefully contain that acquisition cost level around the fourth  the third and fourth quarter of 2020.,REDU,0.2004863619804382,-0.5990282291342195,Negative
In terms of retention rates as I mentioned 2020 is unprecedented year. Most of our students acquired in 2019 who did not experience offline learning because of the pandemic went on online right away after we launched our online courses. So the whole experiences are not that satisfactory. The retention rate came down in the third quarter.,REDU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
However as I mentioned for the fourth quarter and continued in the first two months of this year we see the retention rate going up to the normal level. So for the Beijing the three instalments the renewal rate is already close to 90 back to the level prior pandemic and then the graduation retention rates also coming back to high 60. So we see a very encouraging recovery from retention rate.,REDU,0.9034339785575868,0.8068678419994368,Positive
A little more input for the first question. In addition to Lihong mentioned the offline customer acquisition mindset is values of core competence of RISE as Lihong mentioned. And also we offer more online multiple classes to the customers so we can use this order lease we acquired more effectively. So thats why these cost decreased in this quarter. Thank you.,REDU,0.9999172687530518,0.9998345374074802,Positive
Thank you so much. Operator Instructions And your next question comes from the line of Sheng Zhong from Morgan Stanley. Sheng your line is now open.,REDU,0.9985114932060242,0.9970229846376089,Positive
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Sorry that I lost my connection for awhile. So if my question is already answered you may skip it. I have a few questions here. The first one is about the regulation risk impact. Can you share some of your thinking about this regulation this time in this year Well how and how could that impact the new learning center  new learning center opening because you have 100 learning center opening plan and teacher and tuition fee collection and also maybe the capital supervision impact,REDU,0.9917141199111938,0.9834282299448429,Positive
And I think you mentioned that you expect your Beijing learning centers to reopen later this month. So that  do you already get the government communicate with government yet on this. This is a first question.,REDU,0.766899824142456,0.5337993704076829,Positive
And second one is youre now expanded your subject to mathematics and logic thinking. So could you share some more color on how you  how  what the strategy on this or the operations thinking on this like how this cost develop is internally. And how will acquire students and what the price for the subject And you are targeting number one for  in the offline. So can ask the nearterm target maybe what the current revenue contribution from the subject retention in this year And last one is whats your franchise acquisition plan this year Thank you.,REDU,0.9486650228500366,0.8973299845039753,Positive
A  Lihong Wang,REDU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Sheng. Let me answer the first question first. In terms of regulation we all know that during this month particularly and started from Beijing that more regulation target I would say the training or the  what we call the Foreign Language Sheng as you mentioned there are a number of areas that government wanted to tighten the regulations and put more supervisions. The first is socalled the license to operate excurriculum. And for this one it really reinforced the regulation published in 2018.,REDU,0.9996920228004456,0.9993840452337535,Positive
So we checked our licensing status and feel majority of our schools already obtained licenses and approval. Only a very small number of schools is in the process to getting licensed. And maybe two to three in Beijing there are hard obstacles. For example the property is not  cannot satisfy the requirement.,REDU,0.0133748352527618,-0.9732515056440268,Negative
So I would say we dont have much issue around that area. The second area the government wanted to put more  maybe restrictive measures is the tuition  prepaid tuition. However how to really regulate this is front is still uncertain. And for RISE we already have experience in Shanghai for example that we need to put in a socalled custodian account for each school we opened. And so this is not an issue for RISE particularly with abundant cash that we have on hand.,REDU,0.0039041638374328,-0.9921928597646117,Negative
The second possibility on this front is to work with a bank or insurance firm to put in measures to make sure that if theres anything happened with the socalled providers then the parents can get the money refund. On this one we still are waiting for the detailed implementations. Personally I feel this is not easy to implement so Warren will look for partners and see what is a better way to cope with the regulation.,REDU,0.9362778663635254,0.8725556567643027,Positive
The third you mentioned is whether government encouraging the education accountant. I think for RISE we target a very young age starting at 3. And majority of our students are aged 3 to 6 and the teaching content for RISE focuses on how to communicate how to think logically and how to become the leader for the future. I think this teaching or educational philosophy is consistent with what government wanted to promote. And we are confident that we  plus the mathematical logic thinking courses we really focus on how to train the kids to be a creative thinker to be a logic thinker rather than focusing on test prep. So hopefully on the regulation side we will not be the one really targeted by the government.,REDU,0.9831925630569458,0.9663851060778534,Positive
In terms of learning centers in Beijing we already received requirement from a local district educational bureau to submit documentations and we have data on that. Some of the requirements associated with putting money in the custodian account and also ask a certain percentage of destination. So we are all in the process to satisfy those requirements. However I dont know when we will be allowed to open.,REDU,0.99993634223938,0.999872684402874,Positive
Across the nation we dont see stricter restrictions. And as you can see that our new centers continue to open outside Beijing both direct owned and franchisee centers. So we have the full confidence that this should not be a problem on the center expansion.,REDU,0.977703094482422,0.9554061623848455,Positive
The second question regarding the mathematical logic thinking. In fact we started to create STEAM courses in the middle of 2019. So this  the cost development has been ongoing for quite some time. During the pandemic because we have to move everything online. We made the decision to simplify the STEAM courses to focus on mathematical logic thinking. So that courses already been offered to students since June 2020. And we have tried out in our selfowned learning centers to recruit students and also higher new students recruit new students online directly.,REDU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So we have experience on the teaching and we already have a number of times of renewal for that classes. The reason we think we wanted to target offline because first RISE has a very strong offline network. Second we have very good experience running offline centers both on the operational side and teaching side. The third is we see the landscape  we feel this is a sector already get embraced by parents. However there is no clear leader in the offline market. And through the surveys we conducted we feel very similar to English a majority of the parents are very willing to consider offline courses offered in this category.,REDU,0.0917599201202392,-0.8164812424667136,Negative
As I mentioned we have a plan. So the two ways that we expand our network one is well open a dedicated classroom in our existing selfowned centers. This year we already started three in Beijing and we target to open dedicated classrooms in 30 to 40 selfowned learning centers this year.,REDU,0.983514964580536,0.9670299095093666,Positive
On the franchisee network side we will start from our existing franchisees. In fact the first franchise schools will be open in  hopefully in April in Guangzhou. And this year the target is to sign on 100 franchisees partners. However because its offline they need time to open stores. So for the schools at the end of the year hopefully well see dedicated to mathematics logic franchisee learning centers to be around 20 to 30 schools.,REDU,0.9715989232063292,0.9431978125559164,Positive
In terms of revenue it is still early. So pardon me that we are not at the stage to give you the number. However with the plan to leverage our existing student base and learning centers and franchisee partners we feel very confident that we can roll out the mathematical logic thinking courses very quickly to be meaningful  with meaningful scales at the end of the year. The third question  sorry Sheng I forgot the third question is about,REDU,0.2026016414165496,-0.5947976677403856,Negative
Yes. Its about your acquisition plan of your franchise.,REDU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
A  Lihong Wang,REDU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes yes yes. On this front I will start and let Warren to add more color. This is always our strategy since we get listed in 2017. However the first acquisition of Shijiazhuang really took some time to complete and integrate.,REDU,0.9998583793640136,0.9997167585592022,Positive
The good news is that right now Shijiazhuang is fully integrated into our direct owned business and performed quite resilient during the pandemic. The acquisition gave us a very good experience so this year we will continue the acquisition whenever the right opportunity comes up. Warren you can go ahead and talk more about how we think about the pipeline,REDU,0.9862980842590332,0.9725961521841002,Positive
Yes. We have a lets say a strong pipeline for the acquisition of our franchisees. We basically divided them into three categories first second and third and we are now lets say were talking to a few of them. And we are in the middle of negotiating all the terms. But however we are not  lets say not allowed to disclose anything right now. And hopefully we can announce some good news and file all these files recently. Thank you.,REDU,0.8866844177246094,0.7733687003664376,Positive
Okay. Thank you very much. Thats very helpful.,REDU,0.999267578125,0.9985351553768846,Positive
Thank you so much.,REDU,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
And your next question comes from the line of Blake Lee from Aviation Investment. Blake your line is now open.,REDU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly I want to congratulate RISE team that you have done great job on the number of new students enrolled in Q4. And my question is about the 2021 business outlook and what our assumption is 2021 guidance based on And is there any projection for nearterm Thank you.,REDU,0.99954354763031,0.999087094716486,Positive
Lihong Ill take this. The guidance for the full year 2021 basically shows a resume wide range due to the uncertainties of COVID19 and the progress of our online offline operations in this industry.,REDU,0.0874486565589904,-0.8251037747286409,Negative
As I mentioned in the script of ER that basically we were quite optimistic about the COVID19 situations in this year. And also we have  you can see that we have a strong results in this quarter. Weve demonstrated that we recover from all these impacts and we are quite optimistic about this coming year.,REDU,0.8895257711410522,0.7790514105864825,Positive
Thats the  again let me readout the guidance for the 2021. We expect our revenue in the full year to be in the range of RMB 1420 million to RMB 1730 million. And for this quarter 2021 the Q1 as youll probably know like theres a slight COVID19 impact in Beijing and the Shijiazhuang around the Chinese New Year and so the revenue is around lets say RMB 300 million because of the COVID19. And  but the performance for this quarter will not represent the actual operating outcome and thats we have strong confidence than for the whole year guidance we can make it. Thank you.,REDU,0.9989160895347596,0.9978321777773966,Positive
Yeah Ill just add some color for this year. As I mentioned we right now have very strong operational capability delivering OMO model which means that in normal situations our higher grade classes will have online during weekday. And then all the weekend classes are delivered offline.,REDU,0.8292309045791626,0.6584616055855785,Positive
However if theres any COVID19 situation comes up we will switch the classes online. We can do that within a couple of hours. So in the case of Shijiazhuang and Beijing basically the next day every classes was put online. However the online as you know that has shorter time therefore the revenue recognition will be some compromise or discount. Thats why for the first quarter we still dont know when Beijing will open therefore will impact revenue recognition.,REDU,0.8181562423706055,0.6363122679664301,Positive
However with the capability to switch online offline also the ability to offer additional courses online including the English small classes plus the expansion plans both on the network and the category we feel 2021 will be a very exciting year. So nearterm maybe some fluctuation but for the whole year we have a very high confidence that well be able to deliver very strong results.,REDU,0.7868878841400146,0.5737755142304386,Positive
Okay. Thank you very much.,REDU,0.9836810827255248,0.9673621459973727,Positive
Thank you so much. And our next question comes from the line of Joy Wei from 86Research. Your line is now open.,REDU,0.9962040185928344,0.9924080326605036,Positive
Hi management. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one more question. Its on the competitive landscape. So how do management view the current competition environment. So we noticed that certain AI classes are gaining popularity recently such as Zebra AI cost et cetera. So how do management view the challenge this kind of new form player has brought Thank you.,REDU,0.999604105949402,0.9992082114268612,Positive
Thank you. Its a very good question. On the competitive landscape we definitely feel 2020 also onwards going forward will be very interesting. First thing first we still see very strong demand for offline learning at the same time combined with desire to have online exposure as well.,REDU,0.9999424815177916,0.9998849629670159,Positive
So on the offline side in fact we actually see fewer competitors. Some really cannot just survive during the pandemic and the people survived especially like RISE offering OMO model becomes stronger. Thats also why you see a very strong enrollment in fourth quarter.,REDU,0.9635862112045288,0.9271723790004127,Positive
Normally fourth quarter is not a peak season. However the fourth quarter enrollment for us almost caught up with the third quarter of 2020. So on the offline side we feel very confident. We definitely are the top choices for parents and students.,REDU,0.9951189756393432,0.9902379454600483,Positive
For online there are more formats and players coming into the arena. I think Zebra as you mentioned use AI to offer 15 minutes of classes  class coaching and then they can offer at a very cheap price.,REDU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The observation I have is that definitely attract a lot of youngaged kids and its a very complementary courses to offline study. And in fact during the survey we can see that 30 of our students would have some form of online courses either Zebra or a VIPKid.,REDU,0.9174529910087584,0.8349058836137553,Positive
However at the same time the online students normally would also have one offline courses to complement that because the courses delivered online has a limited effect. So going forward we think these two formats will coexist. And even for RISE as I mentioned during the presentation we definitely see the demand therefore we launched the 100 to 400 premium English small classes online using foreign teachers. This is also a supplement to what we offer offline and through OMO.,REDU,0.2481237649917602,-0.5037533663233319,Negative
So on the higher grade from S2 above the online foreign teacher is part of the normal courses. And for K3 and S1 we actually are selling our 100 to 400 premium online English small classes as additional courses to supplement them. And this year this is part of the strategy as well. So we think right now the student base we target we dont see impacted by the AI courses of course the efficacy are entirely different.,REDU,0.0234230458736419,-0.953155072423859,Negative

Thank you Kettina and thank you everybody for attending today. After several years of detailed work and lots of successful exploration last year we completed the Keno Hill silver district permitting process and began moving the district back into mining operations. 2020 was pivotal for the company and certainly a challenging year to move a mine into production. For sure more than one person has commented to me that making a decision to move to production in the middle of a pandemic might have been a dubious decision. We certainly misread the severity of the second wave in Q4 as borders locked down and isolation requirements were reinstituted. But thanks to the professional and determined attributes of our workforce and response and support from YG from the Yukon government we have been successfully navigating the restrictions posed by the COVID19 pandemic. Our progress is slowed. There are certainly added costs but we are most definitely moving forward towards establishing ourselves as the only primary Canadian silver miner.,AXU,0.9962505102157592,0.9925010159617755,Positive
I should start by summarizing our achievements in 2020 before discussing our outlook for 2021 and our expectation for Keno Hills longerterm future. On the operations front in February we sold our environmental business AEG to the AEG management for a total consideration of 13.4 million. This allowed us to focus all of our resources to our mining business.,AXU,0.812613844871521,0.6252274663612045,Positive
In June following the receipt of the draft water license we announced our decision to move Keno Hill to production by restarting mining operations at the Bellekeno mine and advancing the Flame  Moth and Bermingham deposits into development and ultimately operation. By August we were hard on the recruiting trail and scaling up our surface facilities. And in October we started drilling and blasting underground ore at Bellekeno. All of our production at Bellekeno is long hole in all blocks which had previously been overcut and undercut. Ore from Bellekeno was stockpiled and used for the initial mill commissioning in Q4 2020.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And just anecdotally thats why silver grades have certainly exceeded the mines ore old ph block model grades. And we expect the Bellekeno underground mining operations will extend into Q2 2021 longer than initially anticipated.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Underground development at Bermingham and Flame  Moth started in Q3 2020 and production at Bermingham is scheduled to start in Q2 2021 following completion of the new prime reventilation raise which is about 40 complete as we speak.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In Q4 we were faced with the additional COVID19 restrictions. And as I previously mentioned this affected our hiring program. And that along with slower commissioning of new underground equipment led us to a decision to temporarily suspend underground work at Flame  Moth and focus all of our efforts at least temporarily at Bermingham along with continuing ore production from Bellekeno of course.,AXU,0.0042289793491363,-0.9915432283539942,Negative
In the district mill modifications completed in Q4 2020 included the installation of cyclones a new filter press and modifications to the final feeder. We undertook the initial commissioning runs at the mill in November and processed about 300 tonnes of Bellekeno ore producing our first concentrate.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Staying with the mill construction of a new building around the crusher was completed in Q1 2021 and the installation of a new ventilation system in the crushing facility is scheduled for completion in Q2 2021. The mill continues to operate on a 2 and 2 basis as other mechanical adjustments and circuit modifications mainly focused on metallurgical performance are ongoing and continued during this mill commissioning stage. Through the end of February 2021 we have produced a total of more than 2400 tonnes of ore from Bellekeno with silver head grades and recoveries of 956 grams per tonne silver and 92 respectively. Both of these are above plan. The first leadsilver concentrate and zinc concentrate shipments were dispatched in January 2021.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic we have maintained strict health and safety and social distancing measures and kept our workforce and our community safe. However as I previously mentioned the effects of these measures on workforce schedules recruitment onboarding and training especially our new underground equipment has been slowed by both the COVIDrelated restrictions and the variable ground conditions primarily attributable to innovated quartzite and schist which the operator is a steadily gaining experience. We expect that as COVID19 restrictions ease over the coming months well see further operational improvements.,AXU,0.2149404287338256,-0.5701200783968441,Negative
On the exploration front. Our 2020 surface exploration program confirmed the presence of highgrade silver mineralization first discovered in 2018 below the existing Bermingham deposit. Last years drilling focused on a structurally controlled subhorizontal mineralized zone which has traced over 500 meters along strike and a series of wide stepouts which results generally in the 5 to 18meter true thickness range in terms of the mineralization which generally contain between 1500 and more than 3000 grams per tonne silver.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In total we completed 7600 meters focused along the structurally controlled subhorizontal zone. And this year beginning  as we speak here were anticipating about 25000 meters of directionally controlled drilling to infill the work done in 2020.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Finally in 2020 ERDC advanced the reclamation project to offset historic liabilities in the district. And in July of 2020 the YESAB environmental and socioeconomic assessment board has issued a final decision document on the final valuation report. And ERDC has now entered into the Water Boards  Yukon Water Boards licensing process to obtain the final water license to authorize the activities necessary to begin the closure of the districts historic liabilities. After licensing the reclamation plan will be finalized for submission to the CrownIndigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada for approval prior to execution of the final reclamation plan.,AXU,2.5033950805664062e-05,-0.9999511241621519,Negative
On the financial and corporate front and just to quickly run through some of the metrics in our filings yesterday. For the year ended December 31 2020 we reported an operating loss of 22.3 million much of which is due to increased minerelated expense at Bellekeno and upgrades elsewhere in preparation for the commissioning and startup activity. We finished 2020 with cash and cash equivalents of 23.7 million and net working capital of 15.4 million. We also ended 2020 with 3.9 million in restricted cash and deposits related to our surety bond.,AXU,0.0052704513072967,-0.9894602831961413,Negative
Finally during 2020 we completed 2 equity financings for a total of 38.6 million which of course were largely directed to startup  which are largely being directed to startup activity. More recently and subsequent to yearend 2020 we sold our NSR royalty in Golden Predators Brewery Creek project for 4.5 million in cash. And on January 28 2021 we issued 2.7 million shares and completed an equity financing for total gross proceeds of 11.7 million the majority of which will fund our large exploration program this year.,AXU,0.9536027908325196,0.907205526355223,Positive
In 2021 were focused on ramping up to design throughput of 400 tonnes per day through the mill. Thus far we have been operating the mill on a modified schedule to match ore delivery from Bellekeno and to optimize metallurgical performance of our improved flow sheet including the modified grinding classifying and filter circuits.,AXU,0.1286035478115081,-0.7427939431631227,Negative
With the ore mill feed transitioning to Bermingham sourced ore in Q2 2021 ore production at Flame  Moth beginning in Q3 2021 and provided that were not required to further expand our current COVID19 protocols we are cheered to expect nameplate capacity of 400 tonnes per day through the mill in Q3 of this year. I would say quite confidently that our primary risk in this commissioning and scaleup process is still the COVID risk meaning that further border andor site restrictions resulting from any resurgence of the virus will be increasingly difficult for us to handle.,AXU,0.02431321144104,-0.9513747402279021,Negative
At the same time were working on an updated technical report for an updated mineral resource and reserve estimate that we expect to release in Q2 2021. This report will incorporate a modified mine plan based on our operational experience to date as well as meaningfully improved silver prices since we published our last mine plan in early 2020.,AXU,0.0585769414901733,-0.8828472392840621,Negative
Finally and just to reiterate we are mobilizing our exploration team as we speak planning to begin immediately to drill off the Bermingham Northeast deep mineralization. Well be utilizing 4 drill rigs with directional drilling technology to focus on infill drilling and extension of mineralization with the intention to upgrade the Bermingham mineral resource estimate towards yearend when exploration results will be available.,AXU,0.95818829536438,0.9163765408852942,Positive
The restart of operations at Keno Hill has coincided with strong silver prices and puts us in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities existing in our historic silverrich district and to generate value for our shareholders. We intend to do this by maximizing all of our existing resources maintaining a laserlike focus on commissioning and scaleup activities to achieve design throughput and a 4 millionounce per year silver run rate while also executing perhaps the most important exploration program we have ever conducted.,AXU,0.9978799819946288,0.9957599614619976,Positive
I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we get closer to commercial production and I thank our shareholders for their continued support and confidence in our team.,AXU,0.9992550015449524,0.998510002201797,Positive
Finally I want to reiterate that we owe a debt of thanks to our employees who have soldiered on through pretty rigorous COVIDrelated operating protocols and also to the Yukon government and health officials who have worked handinhand with us to ensure that we can continue to operate through this challenging period.,AXU,0.9195336103439332,0.8390671247643979,Positive
And with that Id like to ask the operator to open the call for questions.,AXU,0.9676219820976256,0.935243925597623,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions. The first question comes from Jake Sekelsky from Alliance Global Partners.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We saw grades well above plan in the initial material that went through the mill. Was this a oneoff or should we expect to see elevated grades from Bellekeno through Q2,AXU,0.972714066505432,0.9454281004834773,Positive
Yes. Good morning Jake and thanks for the question. Yes were carrying a certain block  we carry a block model at Bellekeno. It just happens that theres 2 primary stopes that are being mined there over the course of the next couple of months  will be completed in the next couple of months. Certainly the first one has overachieved its block model grades and that would not be unexpected in a deposit the style of Bellekeno. Were working pretty centrally located in the deposit. The second stope you will have to wait until we get it through the mill to see what the grades might be. But yes I mean Bellekeno is going to overachieve both in terms of  relative to the block model in terms of grade and probably tonnes. Well see.,AXU,0.9992647171020508,0.9985294333275756,Positive
Okay. Thats helpful. And then just on exploration. Obviously its a big focus this year with the 25000meter program in the Bermingham resource update that you mentioned later this year. How should we be thinking about that updated resource relative to the existing mine plan I mean do you think we could see an updated mine plan sometime next year after that resource is out,AXU,0.9986251592636108,0.9972503168882829,Positive
Yes. Thats a decision that were going to have to discuss at Alexco obviously. Id rather  I think wed rather sort of wait and take this step by step. Lets get this drilling done and the resource assuming that the drilling is successful get any resource put together in that deeper area. And then well decide whether or not we should modify mine plan which is already being modified as I mentioned at Bermingham to see whether or not we can accommodate any additional resources should there be any at depth ph.,AXU,0.9970969557762146,0.9941939080917288,Positive
So yes its a good question. We have not made that decision yet. But I would expect that if the drilling is successful I mean well be pretty keen to try and figure out what value would be added by incorporation of that additional mineralization.,AXU,0.9964394569396972,0.9928789096348938,Positive
The next question comes from Joseph Reagor from ROTH Capital Partners.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I guess first thing given the impacts of COVID and a little bit of delays there what should we think about as far as staging of production over the remainder of the year Is there kind of a range you can give us of what tonnes per day might look like on a quarterly basis,AXU,0.7539502382278442,0.5079001831413408,Positive
I mean Brad might want to chime in here but I mean generally Joe were thinking that were going through this commissioning process we definitely need to onboard more plantrelated or millrelated people and to spool that mill up to a more consistent operating basis. I mean right now its operating on a 2 and 2 basis. So we  I mean we would  I think wed be reluctant to put specific tonnes and grade in the commissioning process other than our target which is to achieve 400 tonnes through the mill in Q4  in Q3 sorry of this year. I mean Brad do you have anything you want to add to that,AXU,0.9976791143417358,0.9953582259167588,Positive
No. I think you did  again in general theres  we have a reasonably sized inventory of ore at Bellekeno. And then as Bermingham  were projected to hit our first ore horizon at Bermingham in Q2. And then you start to combine those together and then Flame  Moth a little bit later on. So yes its a gradual rampup period. Were continuing to kind of update our schedules and mine plans as we go along here. So I think thats the best we can see it for the moment.,AXU,0.965587317943573,0.9311745948640078,Positive
Okay. Fair enough. On the note of the rampup is there a certain tonnesperday average you need to get to in order to start treating the production as revenue instead of an offset to CapEx,AXU,0.993878960609436,0.9877579139220201,Positive
Im going to ask Mike Clark to chime in on that because I think we are early adopting  the plan is to early adopt the commercial production whatever you call it language. Mike can you,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Thanks Clynt. Joe yes we are planning to early adopt which means well start recognizing revenues immediately and cost of sales. And so starting in January 2021 all the revenues from Bellekeno well be recognizing. And then as Bermingham starts up in Q2 followed by Flame in Q3 youre going to start seeing all that revenue hit the PL immediately with these  so we wont be offsetting the mineral properties for revenues. Does that answer your question,AXU,0.999975562095642,0.9999511241621517,Positive
Okay. Yes that makes it a lot easier too. All right. And then last thing remaining capital spend between now and reaching that 400 tonnes per day whats it kind of look like,AXU,0.9948196411132812,0.9896392760510897,Positive
I dont know Brad do you want to take a shot at that,AXU,0.8450582027435303,0.6901162207819347,Positive
Yes well theres a couple of different buckets of capital Joe. I mean weve got our PPE capital just to finish up most of  a few of these capital projects the second grinding mill a couple of concentrate regrind mills. So I would put that in a bucket of PPE capital. And thats a relatively modest number 1.5 million to 2 million to finish up those projects. But then you obviously have the working capital to continue to  as we continue to ramp up and reach kind of steady state and positive revenue I mean thats a period as well.,AXU,0.9997673034667968,0.9995346066561974,Positive
So I dont want to put a number on that one yet. Again similar to your previous question I think were kind of continuing to undergo our  kind of our updated I guess mine plans. But again the PPE capital is relatively low but its the working capital until we get to that positive  to that point where its cash flow positive which is into that Q3 range with all 3 mines running.,AXU,0.9908952116966248,0.9817904125394896,Positive
Operator Instructions. The next question comes from Mike Niehueser from Scarsdale Equities.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Clynt I agree with the earlier comment about the grades at Bellekeno. I think that was higher than any grades that you published when it was an operation earlier. Just a couple of housekeeping questions to start. Can you say what the approximate cash balance is today for the company,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Mike can you answer that,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. No were a little over 30 million.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Great. Also theres a lot of the release talked about COVID. Can you comment on in any cases or how it might compare around the Mayo area or Keno Hill with the rest of Yukon or Canada Is it just an abundance caution that these things are happening Or is there something specific with Yukon,AXU,0.9993047118186952,0.9986094228085418,Positive
Yes. Yes. Thanks Mike. Brad is wellversed to answer that question.,AXU,0.9978442788124084,0.9956885550549954,Positive
Yes. Hi Mike. Yes I mean I think in general the Yukon  I mean where the Yukon sits today there does continue to be a  the borders are closed. So anybody that comes into the Yukon even if youre a Yukon resident you do have to quarantine for 14 days. To date theres been 75 cases of COVID in the Yukon. Theres no  currently no active cases. There hasnt been a reported case at any of the three mines as you know between Alexco those 2 other operating mines in the Yukon. There hasnt been a reported case at all 3 of those. And the Yukon is doing pretty well on their vaccination rates. I believe they are leading Canada in terms of the percent of the population.,AXU,0.9590883255004884,0.9181766022304312,Positive
So yes all in all I mean its  there havent been significant outbreaks. But having said that yes I would characterize the approach by the government and health officials as being very cautious conservative. And I dont believe well see much movement in the Yukon certainly until some significant changes across Canada in order to kind of open up travel again.,AXU,0.9478862285614014,0.895772394998309,Positive
Well it sounds like everybody is being extra careful and thats good. Brad this is probably for you. Clynt mentioned in the press release the word variable ground conditions. And I was just wondering if that was something new at Bermingham or Flame  Moth compared to whats happened at Bellekeno or maybe the historic indiscernible.,AXU,0.9982801675796508,0.9965603331091002,Positive
No. I mean I think  I mean as you know I mean Keno Hill is I guess somewhat known for its variable ground. In the development period were in right now we go in and out of a quartzite unit into more of a schistiless component unit and back into quartzite. And we  during that same time period weve got new miners that were bringing on and training.,AXU,0.8934428095817566,0.7868854921373678,Positive
And so its a process of becoming more experienced with that type of ground. Its very similar to what we experienced at Bellekeno but that was 8 to 10 years ago now. So it is somewhat of a kind of a new learning curve if you will between  across the board on operators and equipment and those types of things. So nothing to be  thats a surprise to us and we continue to manage and improve on it.,AXU,0.9695361852645874,0.9390723342134562,Positive
Well it sounds like youre being careful and deliberate. As far as exploration go whats the budget for that 24000 25000 meters at Bermingham Northeast Deep And is it all going to be infill there Or is there going to be some expansion deeper or stepping out,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. I mean well probably spend somewhere between 8 million and 9 million Mike. And it is going to be primarily infill drilling. And it will be more focused on the vertical extent of mineralization versus the horizontal extent which we focused on in 2020. That being said we will certainly drill more holes to the Southwest where we currently understand the mineralization to be. To the Northeast probably not so much. We know where the Northeast termination or offset of that mineralization is. And it would in fact not reappear until were into HectorCalumet proper.,AXU,0.9965190887451172,0.9930381733406624,Positive
So yes. So some extension drilling to the Southwest lots of vertical  trying to understand the vertical extent of the mineralization and infilling between those white space holes that we drilled last year.,AXU,0.2761605381965637,-0.44767978649126683,Negative
Well Im glad you mentioned the vertical because when I look at the crosssection in the most recent release it seems to  reading between the lines youre kind of looking at 100meter block there of this new panel thats being discovered. And then when you look at the other geometry of the veins and how they come together that it kind of pinches out. But I dont know if  my mind says thats not necessarily so because youre above the HectorCalumet which was historically quite thick. But as the  get to the bottom of the terminus of the scheduled mine plant at Bermingham youre getting to that area that really has the best silver grades and the highest lead grades. And Im just wondering if youre going to be targeting under that area because wondering if thats a shoot or a feeder or something like that.,AXU,0.9997774958610536,0.9995549914568613,Positive
Yes. Like I say I mean what youre talking about is to the southwest of where we drilled. We feel that theres a certain structural intersection that we have identified  that the geologists have identified at Bermingham. And we are following that  the projection of that structural intersection along to the Northeast. And that structure and dissection persists all the way up through the Bellekeno the Bermingham deposit itself and is the locus for mineralization.,AXU,0.9826247096061708,0.9652493984993689,Positive
Now that does not mean to say that between that structural intersection and where the existing deposit occurs there is not more mineralization for sure. Its just that we know that there are targeted mechanisms as such that the meatier parts of the deposit are traditionally around that structural intersection and thats what were focused on.,AXU,0.9577602744102478,0.9155204984667888,Positive
Well it just seems that youre not near where you can determine that youre closed off at depth and that its just a matter of drilling and its getting progressively more expensive. But I just have the sense that youre going to execute a well  a stepup of operations but the exploration here this year could be another pivot for you. And that the ending of the year is going to be quite interesting when you look back on the last couple of years. So those are just my questions and comments.,AXU,0.0345471799373626,-0.9309067910354085,Negative
Yes. Thanks Mike. I mean certainly its going to be a very interesting year. And it goes back to Jakes question earlier which was  okay so youre assuming that theres mineralization in this new area. What are you going to do in terms of the mine plan and future development And those are the things that we at Alexco have to figure out. And I once again go back to the stepbystep progression which is lets drill it first figure out what we are looking at and then go the next step.,AXU,0.9999712109565736,0.999942421878828,Positive
Well at the bottom of that terminus where you get those really high grades that were discovered it seems like you can just drift straight over and just pick up that whole panel but I cant help but think youre going to spiral deeper right there at the terminus as well.,AXU,0.7866728901863098,0.5733455260667359,Positive
Yes. Well see. Its unknown at this point for sure.,AXU,0.76884526014328,0.5376902447284726,Positive
The next question comes from Lee Curry from Curry Partners ph.,AXU,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I just wanted to get a little few more details on the exact impact of the COVID lockdown restrictions. You mentioned that the workers are subject to a 14day quarantine. Did the workers mining personnel that are there on site can they leave Are they leaving and going vacation and not coming back Are new ones coming in And does being  can working in the mine include being quarantined In other words how hamstrung are you,AXU,0.0010823011398315,-0.9978365885237388,Negative
Yes. Thats a good question Lee and Brad will answer that.,AXU,0.9969619512557985,0.9939238988899584,Positive
Yes. Lee Ill just give you maybe kind of a high level I mean summary of all of the protocols and how we currently have to operate. So we are able to bring in employees from outside the Yukon right to the mine site. And they can work but they must quarantine at the end of their day. So at the end of a typical 12hour day all employees need to go back to the room. They cant leave their room. Meals are brought to them. They cant use the recreation facilities. We have to keep all of our Yukon employees separated from nonYukon employees. And that means separate charters to site separate buses separate vehicle transportation. We have a fulltime nurse on site. So we do daily checks every morning. We have part of our camp thats been isolated off for an isolation unit in case there is  anybody even gets a sniffle we pull them out of the main population.,AXU,4.312396049499512e-05,-0.9999149441212083,Negative
So thats  its pretty rigorous and its certainly hard on employees to have to kind of live I guess if you will under those types of conditions. And when this was first  when the Yukon government in early November first reimplemented or reinstituted these travel restrictions we probably lost a couple of rotations that we had to stand down if you will our employees. We just needed time to respond and put new plans together. So hopefully that gives you kind of an overview of how were trying to manage this.,AXU,0.9865678548812866,0.9731356937501989,Positive
This concludes the questionandanswer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Clynton Nauman for any closing remarks.,AXU,0.8004216551780701,0.6008430724400713,Positive

Now let me turn the call over to Pete to provide additional details on our financial results. Pete,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Mark. Overall we were pleased with the results for the quarter which reflected the continuation of improving business trends and large deal volume. I will now go through our financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2021. Unless otherwise stated all references to our expenses and operating results are on a nonGAAP basis and are reconciled to our GAAP results in the earnings release and presentation that was posted before the call.,SMAR,0.999820590019226,0.9996411798245783,Positive
Our Q4 results were positively impacted by an easing of COVIDrelated sales headwinds we saw earlier in the year continued strength of larger transactions and a strong close to the fiscal yearend by our sales organization that was supported by a yearend customer budget benefit.,SMAR,0.97567480802536,0.9513495870528141,Positive
For our fullyear 2021 we ended with total revenue of 385.5 million up 42 yearoveryear billings of 450.7 million up 35 yearoveryear operating loss of 41 million and free cash flow of negative 31.6 million. We ended the year with annual recurring revenue of approximately 440 million.,SMAR,0.0344916582107543,-0.9310178345548122,Negative
Next I will provide more color on our fourth quarter financial results. As previously mentioned fourth quarter revenue came in at 109.9 million up 40 yearoveryear. Subscription revenue cross the 100 million mark for the first time and it was 101.1 million accelerating yearoveryear growth to 42. Services revenue was 8.8 million representing yearoveryear growth of 18. The Brandfolder contribution to total revenue in the fourth quarter was 4 million exceeding our expectations.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Now turning to billings. Fourth quarter billings came in strong at 151.2 million which was an acceleration in the yearoveryear growth rate to 49. Brandfolder contributed 5.9 million to our billings number which also exceeded our guidance. Approximately 90 of our subscription billings were annual with 5 monthly. Quarterly semiannual and multiyear billings represented 5 of the total.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Moving on to our reported metrics. We now have 11874 customers paying us 5000 or more per year 1515 paying 50000 or more per year and 588 now paying us 100000 or more per year. These customer segments now represent 82 46 and 32 respectively of total ARR. Our domain average ACV grew 40 yearoveryear to 5103. We ended the quarter with a dollarbased net retention rate of 123. The full churn rate improved and is now below 7.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
You may notice that our billings number came in higher than our guidance while our dollarbased net retention rate was in line with our expectations. This is due to a greater proportion of our billings this quarter coming from both new customers and expansion of customers that we acquired over the past year neither of which would impact our Q4 dollarbased net retention rate.,SMAR,0.9726479649543762,0.9452958973025662,Positive
For the first quarter we expect our dollarbased net retention rate to remain around 123 as we lapped the first COVIDimpacted quarter. Through the remainder of the year we expect dollarbased net retention rate to trend moderately higher.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Id like to provide additional color on our progress with our large customer segment which we defined as a customer with over 10000 total employees. At the end of fiscal year 2021 we had over 2800 customers in this segment of which 41 had annual recurring revenue of 500000  greater than 500000 up from 19 a year ago. This customer ARR level represents an investment in the Smartsheet platform that encompasses a broad selection of our offerings.,SMAR,0.9052737951278688,0.8105474773332344,Positive
This large customer segment represents approximately a quarter of our current ARR with significant expansion potential. If we expanded the remaining domains in this cohort to the 500000 ARR level which we have shown an ability to do the total ARR opportunity for this segment would be around 1.4 billion. Our strategy across all segments starts with organic adoption and subsequent expansion. This is seen in this segment as well where a greater than 80 of these customers had ARR of less than 5000 in their first year. This segment also exhibits higher expansion rates.,SMAR,0.9992725253105164,0.9985450497538149,Positive
As of Q4 the dollarbased net retention rate for the over10000employee customer segment was 140 higher than the rest of our customer population. Additionally we are seeing significant active user growth in this segment which also supports our conviction and while we continue to invest in features products and packaging to further support our growth with large customers.,SMAR,0.9658164978027344,0.9316329548555344,Positive
As we think about the growth opportunity ahead we have firmly established Smartsheet as the CWM solution of choice for enterprises with broad applicability for companies of all sizes. As shown earlier we have a long growth runway ahead. We will continue to invest in our opportunity and I look forward to providing additional details on our progress in the coming quarters.,SMAR,0.9115856885910034,0.8231712717838715,Positive
Now turning back to the financials. Our total gross margin was 81 2 percentage points better than the third quarter. As youll recall our gross margin was adversely impacted in Q3 due to the presence of duplicative server costs associated with our migration to the public cloud. The completion of the migration in Q3 meant that the duplicative costs did not repeat in Q4. Our expectation for gross margin for the fiscal 2022 is to be between 79 and 81 as we look at leveraging public cloud infrastructure internationally.,SMAR,4.917383193969727e-05,-0.9999028443711069,Negative
Overall operating loss in the quarter was negative 5.3 million or 5 of revenue down from 22 of revenue a year ago. This was built on yearoveryear leverage in all functional areas. Free cash flow was positive 9.9 million which exceeded our guidance. Longer term our model has the capability to generate significant cash flow at scale.,SMAR,0.051328033208847,-0.8973450644880918,Negative
Now before I move on to guidance a quick housekeeping item. In the past we had reported out on our licensed user count at the end of each fiscal year. Recently we have expanded our product offerings to include new products and packaging structures that provide us with new ways to monetize more of our user base. This is a trend we expect to continue. As it does focusing on licensed users will understate our increasing ability to monetize our user base. Due to this evolution in our business going forward we will continue to report out on our total community size each quarter. However we will no longer report out on our licensed user count.,SMAR,0.9959723949432372,0.9919447850851921,Positive
Now let me move on to guidance. Our fiscal year 2022 guidance contemplates a gradual improvement in the macro environment in the second half of the year. This drives our expectation of billings seasonality that is weighted more towards the back half of the year. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 we expect revenue to be in the range of 111 million to 112 million billings to be in the range of 118 million to 119 million nonGAAP operating loss to be in the range of 19 million to 17 million and nonGAAP net loss per share to be between 0.15 and 0.14 based on weighted average shares outstanding of 123.5 million. Our net free cash outflow is expected to be in the range of 12 million to 10 million.,SMAR,0.1193248331546783,-0.7613513835378788,Negative
For the full fiscal year we expect our revenues to be in the range of 500 million to 505 million representing growth of 30 to 31. We expect billings to be in the range of 580 million to 585 million representing growth of 29 to 30. We expect nonGAAP operating loss to be in the range of 55 million to 45 million and nonGAAP net loss per share to be between 0.44 and 0.36 for the year based on approximately 124 million weighted shares outstanding. And we expect our free cash flow margin in fiscal year 2022 to be between minus 6 and minus 4 an improvement from minus 8 in fiscal year 2021.,SMAR,0.0852944552898407,-0.8294121798349499,Negative
In closing I would emphasize a few points in relation to our business. First the Smartsheet business has diversified across segments verticals and geographies with customer ARRs that range in size from a few hundred dollars to several million dollars. Second our customer spending priorities grow and scale well with our solutions and we will continue to invest in this opportunity. Third with rapid innovation in our proprietary features and our MA over the past couple of years we have significantly widened our competitive moat. And finally we have an incredibly powerful distribution model with large community of over 8 million users. This positions us incredibly well to execute the fiscal year 2022 plan and maintain our position as a leader in enterprise CWM.,SMAR,0.9984225034713744,0.9968450050622253,Positive

Thank you. Operator Instructions Your first question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.9997451305389404,0.9994902607740526,Positive
Hi. Thank you and congrats on a great quarter and a great end to the year. Mark maybe this first one is probably for you. But you mentioned in your prepared remarks a little bit on the evolution of the solution strategy and I was just wondering if you can maybe expand for us a little bit what the changes you are making to the solutions are and how  maybe how should we think about the impact that will have on your pricing strategy for some of those accelerators and other valuebased capabilities,SMAR,0.9999969005584716,0.9999938011132483,Positive
Yes. Arjun I think well take this as a twoparter so Ill answer  I have a couple of comments and Ill let Gene cover off. So I think two things were trying to do is is respond to customer signal. And when I think about what we did with accelerators in prior years solving for very specific use cases really letting people take advantage of this composite of our dashboards and our sheets and our reports and our forms people like those. But the things that were seeing is were scaling further in the enterprise is a different set of needs. It can be on the dimension of scale and control things for which were actually developing proprietary IP. So technology is being built. Its way beyond just the configuration of a solution. So Ill let Gene speak to that in a second.,SMAR,0.9924193620681764,0.9848387150995228,Positive
The second piece around packaging and pricing thats very important. Over the last few years as weve created more and more capabilities we have this evergrowing portfolio of things and people want simplicity in how they engage with us. So for us to get our median sales rep to be able to sell quickly and confidently and let customers to be able to react to that well there needs to be a simplicity in the offer. And thats what were achieving now with the change in packaging as well as with this newly enhanced set of offerings. Gene,SMAR,0.9810281991958618,0.9620563757755611,Positive
Yes. Building on Marks comments its really a shift that weve taken based on customer signal where  on the solutions side customers are looking for the ability to really tailor solutions more precisely to their individual business needs and theyre looking for the ability that when they license a set of capabilities being able to apply those capabilities across multiple use cases is a functional area. So for example in marketing we have an accelerator for event management customers are saying Hey what Id really like is to be able to license a set of capabilities that will support marketing event management and campaign management and creative content development and the list goes on.,SMAR,0.9994783401489258,0.9989566796759841,Positive
And so what weve essentially done is look to a new packaging approach that takes our premium capabilities that will still be available as a la carte or individual capabilities. But were now also offering them in a bundle or a package of premium platform capabilities that our customers can license at a significant discount or a value when they license the package versus buying them individually.,SMAR,0.9994324445724488,0.9988648884683184,Positive
And by positioning that platform it really enables us to grow with less friction within customers because they then have the entire platform to be able to build on top of. And then it also changes how we monetize because weve actually priced that premium offering based on the number of connected users to the actual platform. And so a company that has Smartsheet deployed within a department can license it at a price point that is commensurate with the value that they get at the department level. As they expand and add more connected users across the enterprise renewal that will then relicense or expand that customer at a higher price point.,SMAR,0.9887394905090332,0.977478967594485,Positive
Got it. Thats very helpful. Thanks for the color. And then Pete maybe one for you a little bit of an openended question. But after being in the CFO seat for 90 days now it would be great if you can share with us some of your early observations about the business overall as a newer member of the leadership team. And then from a financial perspective I know you mentioned the licensed user disclosure change but curious if we should expect any other changes in disclosures going forward Thank you.,SMAR,1.0,1.0,Positive
Arjun thanks for the question. So first 90 days have flown by really fast. Theres probably three takeaways for me. The first one is you always hear the word TAM and you have to actually feel it. So as I joined Smartsheet actually using the product and figuring how it could work and actually did work was just a realization of that opportunity. You can see the TAM  you can see the TAM at play. I couldnt be in any more Zoom calls and get the work done.,SMAR,0.1690140962600708,-0.6619727980928409,Negative
The second one is as I dug into the business I have confidence in the business. I believe the opportunity is here. The longterm opportunity is our focus and our nearterm investment should help us unlock it. So I believe that. And then the last part of it is the leadership team. I think for every opportunity the leadership team is what unlocks it and as Ive gone through this year of experienced leadership team that really knows how to take advantage of it and scale into that opportunity. So those are my three quick observations. The second part of your question was on metrics changing. Were not changing any metrics other than the one I specifically called out as a part of our housekeeping.,SMAR,0.9981056451797484,0.9962112881012486,Positive
Perfect. Thank you and congrats again on the results.,SMAR,0.9978978037834167,0.9957956050608188,Positive
Thanks Arjun.,SMAR,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Thanks. I want to echo the congratulations. Great quarter. Hi Mark Pete Gene and Aaron. And also I did like the disclosure around the larger enterprises with 10000 plus employees. That was very helpful. I had two questions after all of that there. Mark I tend to ask about where we are in just kind of the market itself the collaborative work management market and its evolution. Youll have a lot more capabilities now you have nocode apps you have Bridge you have all these other things that are kind of infrastructure oriented for enterprises. Are you seeing as we went through calendar 2020 and how you think about 2021 are you seeing much larger landings when you get into a new enterprise for the first time that you hadnt touched before or is the initial acquisition kind of size is it changing much And then I had a followup question.,SMAR,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
Hi Terry. I think we have the opportunity to land larger but the beautiful thing is not a requirement right. So if you have someone who really wants to accelerate right out of the gate and want to consume a premium platform thing with Brandfolder included and fully digitized a large workflow they can do so. But I would say that the ability for them to maintain that optionality still remains critical. We still see evidence of teams within large departments at really large companies wanting to have that earned enterprise approach. So its important as we come up with these new offerings were not forcing the customers hand were giving them an option.,SMAR,0.9993083477020264,0.9986166945795385,Positive
And I think thats where as Gene said the a la carte approach or the fully packaged bundle approach I think its something that is still very much needed. I would say though that with Brandfolder was a good example where we had a couple of new wins that were in the high five figure range. And its a wonderful performance by that team.,SMAR,0.9954932928085328,0.9909865802446489,Positive
Yes. And Pete maybe a question for you. Thanks for the disclosure on the acquisition or Brandfolder benefit. So I think you said 5.9 million. Can you remind us what the expectation if there was one you laid out going into the quarter for billings and did anything change because of what youre seeing in the signals on the acquired business contribution to billings in FY2022 Thank you.,SMAR,0.998744249343872,0.9974884971907716,Positive
So Terry the number we guided to for Brandfolder was 4 million and we came in at 5.9 million. So thats the specific answer to your question. And then what did we see in the market We saw a great deal of traction for the Brandfolder product. We saw them engaged in sort of customers really leaning into Brandfolder. And thats sort of what were seeing in the marketplace.,SMAR,0.999856412410736,0.9997128246503022,Positive
Your next question comes from line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Great quarter as well. I wanted to dig in into the large customer commentary. Maybe you can talk about Mark what is it that you think is the biggest bottleneck you have right now in taking these 2800 customers that have 10000 employees plus that on average spend with you I dont know 40000 and getting them into 0.25 million and 0.50 million What is the main bottleneck How much of that is productdriven versus gotomarket approach,SMAR,0.856465220451355,0.7129302697958171,Positive
All right. So I think it is really a combination of the two. I mean you cant round go without the product capabilities. But if you dont have the mechanisms the sales muscle the advisory service the sort of a journey mapping for the customer youre putting an intense amount of pressure on your prospect to your customer to figure that out on their own. So as we look at leaning in on our large enterprise team buildout both with quotacarrying reps and with advisory services those are things that we think are fundamental. So I would say the bottleneck or the opportunity for growth is really in building that team out. I think were doing all the right things on the platform piece to make it happen but its really building the team and also enabling partners to contribute to it.,SMAR,0.9999760985374452,0.9999521970463976,Positive
Got it. Okay. And so as I think about your evolution through the year can you talk about some of your plans for quotabased individuals and how frontloaded thats going to be Or maybe if youre not going to say numbers at least by how much  what percentage you intend to increase your quotabased individuals team this year,SMAR,0.9849134683609008,0.9698269187372437,Positive
Ittai this is Pete. So essentially like weve done every year we are planning to increase the size of our sales team. And as youll recall we stayed on point in our investment in fiscal year 2021. So we started there. We are going to add 25 more headcount resources. And like Ive said that we added more in the first part of the year than the latter.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Got it. Very good. Good luck guys. Thanks.,SMAR,0.9999712705612184,0.9999425410881886,Positive

Your next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi guys. This is Melissa Dunn on for Stan. Thank you for taking the question. I think the first thing I was hoping to ask about is your performance in billings for Q4 obviously had a really strong quarter. Is there anything you can flag that happened in the quarter that you werent necessarily expecting when issuing your guidance originally and anything we should be aware of in terms of maybe onetime dynamics in the quarter And any more color on the strength there would be really helpful.,SMAR,0.9974172115325928,0.99483441998626,Positive
I think in our prepared remarks Melissa we referenced the three things. We talked about less macroeconomic headwinds. We talked about the volume of larger transactions and the strong sales execution. Those were absolutely the case. We sort of covered those fairly well. I would say a couple of things we expanded across almost every vertical. Our sales time  our sales cycle time has reduced and our pipeline conversion improved all in line with the earlier comments I made.,SMAR,0.9999120235443116,0.9998240469837472,Positive
Okay. Thank you. And then maybe a question for you Mark. So on the user experience enhancements to the product are there specific things that youre trying to solve for with the new improvements,SMAR,0.9999991655349731,0.9999983310689515,Positive
Yes. I think there are a couple of items. One is I think a more refined look and feel but theres also a huge part of that which is around discoverability right. We have this evergrowing set of capabilities unless you can have your users unlock those and benefit from them they somewhat dont matter. So were really looking forward to being able to make certain things much more obvious. And again over the years weve added a lot to the product and now our job is not only to build but to also make sure that theres full attach across the suite and thats really what were aiming to do.,SMAR,0.9105082750320436,0.8210164433815741,Positive
Okay. Thank you.,SMAR,0.9836810827255248,0.9673621459973727,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey there. Thanks. Good afternoon. It sounded like on the commentary that the net expansion rate is stabilizing here in the low 120 as I think. We appreciate the additional disclosure on the large customer side whereas that number breaks out closer to 140. Can you just expand on the large customer expansion opportunity that 1.4 billion ARR opportunity youre highlighting how youre defining that and how you effectively prioritize penetrating that from a product and gotomarket perspective,SMAR,1.0,1.0,Positive
So Ill take the first part of it and Ill let Mark speak a little bit to the second part of sort of how we are going after the opportunity. The way we discussed the opportunities we said we have 2800 customers today who have more than 10000 employees are already customers of ours. We have 41 of those who pay us greater than 0.5 million in annual recurring revenue. If I took the remaining population base and converted them all over to 500000 and you did the math you would come up with 1.4 billion. Thats the way we did the opportunity sizing. Mark Ill pass over to you.,SMAR,0.9634703397750854,0.9269406360033965,Positive
Yes. I think in terms of the gotomarket I think a big part of this is is really marrying a very strong land and expand motion with an opinionated sales approach. So if we go into a larger customer that we know has significant needs across automation customer enablement planning these are the things that we can come in with a solution set. We can assign a significant ROI to it which would command a more significant level of investment. So I think the path to getting from 41  over 0.5 million contributors to dramatically increasing that is to have more of those pairings of the topdown guiding advisory examining how we can best help paired with that bottom up. And thats something which again were developing right now. A few years ago it didnt exist at our company if the muscle has been built and now we need to scale.,SMAR,0.9949880838394164,0.9899761617041596,Positive

Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask two questions that are related and I think Ill direct them to Mark if I could. Mark first on the competitive landscape I wanted to get an update on your thinking And in particular I think about how the market may unfold as it relates to RPA. Right now you indicated you signed a recent partnership with UiPath but how do you think that particular segment has the risk or opportunity of overlapping in the next couple of years,SMAR,0.9972090721130372,0.9944181408990271,Positive
Im actually going to let Gene speak to this one.,SMAR,0.83501136302948,0.6700225293770607,Positive
Yes. Hi Keith. I think that  yes the question is really around where do we see RPA playing out around relative to our capabilities. And in doing the agreement with UiPath it was really driven by a signal from  that both companies were receiving from customers where their workflows in modern enterprise that really cross between the more what Ill call routine kind of onrails structured work into unstructured dynamic work where you need to  you have a degree of variability that machines are not going to be able to adapt for and customer desire to be able to take workflows that maybe start in that structured space and theyre using RPA to improve efficiency and throughput and then be able to pass those off to an unstructured or dynamic workflow thats being managed at Smartsheet.,SMAR,0.8948252201080322,0.7896503148378817,Positive
And I think you can actually work both ways. You can start in the unstructured side and move to structured and vice versa. I think your question is really around how do we see those converging. Well I think there will be increasing marriage between those technologies as more and more companies find ways to leverage machine intelligence to really eliminate what I call kind of the nobrainer workflows that today are being done by humans mainly because systems cant talk to each other very well. I think thats very different than whats happening in the unstructured space where you really have to have that ability to adapt and change really really quickly.,SMAR,0.827593207359314,0.6551862091935927,Positive
And so I dont think theres ever a complete overlap. I think its really a nice marriage going forward. And our goal is to be positioned as the platform of choice to be able to support the unstructured side of work.,SMAR,0.0509558022022247,-0.8980895269450706,Negative
Okay. That makes perfect sense to me. The second question is on increasing your dollar penetration rates. If you look even at your largest customers your dollar percent of spend per customer is still relatively low and while its been coming up nicely Im just wondering how that moves more rapidly. And the area that I wanted to focus on is both the Accelerator strategy and the capabilitybased projects that you talked about in marketing as an example. But how do you think about that unfolding over the next two years to try to increase your dollar penetration so to speak,SMAR,0.9984276294708252,0.9968552570672375,Positive
So in other words if you look at accelerators now as a percent of your billings and you combine that two years from now with the marketingbased capabilities plus the extended family how do you think that changes And do you think that moves the needle on your dollarbased penetration of your customers,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. So let me kind of break this down. I think theres really a couple of different elements to it. I think it starts with some of the things Mark talked about around how do we be more intentional and more opinionated in helping customers accelerate their journey. COVID has provided this amazing opportunity where companies are realizing that they kind of business as usual in the way theyve been operating for years. Its likely not going to be the preferred way to operate as we come out of the pandemic.,SMAR,0.2302556037902832,-0.5394897100268066,Negative
And so theres a real catalyst for folks to rethink and companies to rethink how theyre operating. So I think us being positioned to really help guide them on that journey through our sales and support services is probably at the tip of the sphere. To support that I think theres really two key elements of our offerings. The first is in the platform  premium platform capabilities weve talked about.,SMAR,0.2493273317813873,-0.5013462313093134,Negative
One of the things weve learned over time with customers is that when you sell against a specific solution or a specific need customers drive a lot of value from that. But then many times immediately say hey this works so well here I want to go pivot to the next use case. And when they just licensed a subset of our platform theyre not always able to solve for that beautifully. So we have to come back and relicense or it creates friction in the process which slows down expansion and their ability to drive value from Smartsheet.,SMAR,0.996468186378479,0.9929363685467056,Positive
So shifting to a more holistic premium platform approach we think really is going to take the brakes off of our customers ability to extend Smartsheet and the value we create across the enterprise more quickly and solve for a broader set of use cases in a lower friction way. The third thing I would mention is Work Apps and the nocode capabilities that that introduces. We are seeing really positive signal from customers. Its still very early and theres a lot of  lot that were bringing to market over the course of this year to really enable Work Apps to be deployed at scale and manage at scale. But we really see that ability to create curated experiences around workflows and specific use cases as truly differentiating and really empowering because its a true nocode platform where business users are able to build and configure these solutions and deploy them really really quickly and then modify or adjust when businesses present.,SMAR,0.9999955892562866,0.9999911785073152,Positive
So I think the combination of the intentional and advisory gotomarket with our platform and our Work Apps capabilities I think they are really the key to accelerating that journey to large ARR customer.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. Helpful. Many thanks.,SMAR,0.9987810254096984,0.9975620493662649,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Berg from Needham. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi Mark Gene and Pete. Congrats on the great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. And Gene I promise I wont ask for you to pick your favorite children here on this call.,SMAR,0.9998249411582948,0.999649882107903,Positive
Thank you Scott. I was practicing.,SMAR,0.9582037329673768,0.9164074161096909,Positive
I guess the first question Mark is you saw another competitor in the space get acquired over the last 90 days since we had this last call. And I think I asked a similar question on the last acquisition 90 days ago. But two acquisitions in the space in a short timeframe I think certainly speaks highly in the space. But how do you see maybe the collaborative work management sector unfolding over the next two to four years and does this heightened consolidation I guess maybe anything in particular Thank you.,SMAR,0.1716669797897339,-0.6566670278710294,Negative
Yes. I dont really have commentary on sort of the acquisition dynamics. But what I would say its a recognition that the space is young and growing and were investing heavily. You have larger caps as evidenced by Adobe and Citrix wanting to participate. So I think theres really strong agreement that theres growth opportunity. And were maniacally focused on our strategy and executing it. And I will say that those  both neither of those events meaningfully caused us to adjust our strategy or our investment posture.,SMAR,0.8801042437553406,0.7602083445837167,Positive
Got it. Helpful. And then a followup question someone else recently asked about the net revenue retention rate looks like its kind of stabilized in the low 120s here. But as we think about that metric here in the current quarter or maybe over the next couple has the upsell pace normalized to what you saw prepandemic or is there still a couple of steps to take there as the rest of the economy rebounds,SMAR,0.9372169971466064,0.8744339194499966,Positive
Scott this is Pete. So the net dollar retention rate has sort of stabilized at the 123 mark. And thats sort of really guided Q1 because its lapping our first COVID quarter. I think if I were to sort of break this down we are instead of waiting for the upsell piece to pick up going forward and thats factored into my commentary around moderate improvements in the net dollar retention rate.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats again on the good quarter.,SMAR,0.9997668266296388,0.999533652981313,Positive
Thanks Scott.,SMAR,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of David Hynes from Canaccord. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey thanks guys. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. Mark I want to kind of build on Scotts last question right If I think back a couple of quarters ago it seemed to me like the transactional business was really healthy. The enterprise stayed fairly strong but there was kind of a blip with expansion of customers in the middle right And I think the numbers would suggest youre seeing some recovery in Q4. But I just want to ask explicitly about kind of what youre seeing with that expansion business in the middle customer cohort. And if it is in fact getting better was it just time and recovery Or is there something that you did to kind of affect change there,SMAR,0.999982476234436,0.9999649524479821,Positive
I think one of the things that Im really pleased to see is that both at the larger customer segment really all up and down the stack were seeing a shortening of sales cycles again. So if we had  were down about 15 to 20 from what we saw in Q2 and thats a really good indicator. So I look at velocity as a really important factor. And its not just velocity of the over 10000 employees its all the way down to emerging companies. So thats a really positive trait that were able to monitor. So I think the  in terms of the number of transactions I think were  that the ability to simplify ones offerings I think are a huge huge input to achieving a different result. I do think macro is important too. We are still coming out of COVID where hopefully vaccinations continue to go smoothly.,SMAR,0.9999740719795228,0.999948143928137,Positive
But I think making what we do whats within our control easier for people to consume is probably as large of an impact. So I think were making right choices there. And again its always interesting when you go to launch new things obviously as Gene said that many of these decisions with existing customers. The puck is on the ice now for real and we will get to see in Q1 whether all of that research and packaging does what we hope it does.,SMAR,0.9999457001686096,0.9998914002724888,Positive
Yes. Makes sense. And then maybe a decent segue. So like where are there other opportunities that you think you could verticalize by function right I mean obviously Brandfolder has been a huge success in marketing and you guys have done some stuff organically in that area. Like where else do you have a concentration of users inside of large organizations that would make sense for kind of more vertically tailored efforts,SMAR,0.9999920725822448,0.9999841451550393,Positive
Well I think that the most obvious and the one that were most excited about right now is really Ill call it kind of disrupting traditional PPM. Almost every company has an element of project program process management and its something  thats a significant use case for us today but an area where the work were doing with 10000 feet and Smartsheet we think and some of the newer stuff thats in the pipeline we have a real opportunity to disrupt there and really deliver pretty transformational experience for our customers that really moves away from a lot of the limitations of kind of the legacy platforms in that space. So thats an area that were focused on and well be launching something later this year.,SMAR,0.9062662720680236,0.8125324323966694,Positive
Beyond that I think that were seeing really early signs  positive signs on document generation workflows and being able to leverage some of the capabilities that weve recently launched there combined with signature and our workflow automation that I think have a lot of potential. We havent narrowed on a specific function but that is an area that Im bullish on exploring.,SMAR,0.9985476732254028,0.9970953447194961,Positive
Thats great. Thanks for the color.,SMAR,0.9993765354156494,0.9987530700880707,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy from JPMorgan. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Thank you. I will add my congrats. Pete I believe during Q3 you had still seen some minor type of strain from industries like travel and retail and entertainment. Can you just comment on what you saw in Q4 Did those headwinds stayed materially And in your forecast do you see those customers kind of reengaging with you this fiscal year,SMAR,0.9999996423721312,0.9999992847438361,Positive
So Mark Ill answer your question in two parts. The first is the vertical piece of it. So we did see between Q3 and Q4 sort of strong momentum in most industries the impacted industries were still travel and entertainment so that continues to be a headwind. And then the second part of your question was on returning customers. We saw about the same number of customers who had left us in Q1 and Q2 that I described in Q3 a similar number came back in Q4. So were seeing that trend of people coming back as economics improves.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. One quick housekeeping item Pete. Are you able to ballpark the percentage contribution from capabilitybased offerings in Q4 If you mentioned that I mightve missed it,SMAR,0.9728134274482728,0.9456268224876063,Positive
I didnt mention it but if I were to give you a sense of it on a revenue basis yearoveryear the capabilities range from a 13 a year ago for the same quarter to 20 now. So thatll give you a sense for how strong our capabilities business is.,SMAR,0.8898690938949585,0.7797380565035681,Positive
Okay perfect. And then Mark I wanted to go back to I think something you alluded to. Im wondering how tangible maybe are any signs that this whole category of collaborative work management perhaps it wasnt the immediate pandemic response category but that  maybe it was something that was just destined to happen a little later in the cycle. And companies have a little more time to think about getting work done outside of Zoom as Pete referenced. And maybe theyre getting a little more visibility into the distribution of their workforces how itll settle out. So I guess Im just wondering is there something beyond kind of macro recovery to the prior glide path and maybe a little extra spending wave that you might be seeing developing here,SMAR,0.9288992285728456,0.857798372386916,Positive
Yes. Id love to see that extra wave develop. I think what there is recognition of is that synchronous communication. Theyre sort of an upper bound to what people can handle. I mean I am on Zoom a lot and I would say its an essential part of my day but I also recognize and I think customers are recognizing that is not the only tool that we can lean on to actually conduct business. So I think this notion of asynchronous work the ability to track something mechanize something and not have to rely on a live conversation is very important. I think we are  as we talked about a couple of earnings calls ago we talked about the phases right Phase one was react support make sure people are safe synchronous synchronous synchronous. And now were entering that phase of async is absolutely here and people are going to make investments in it.,SMAR,0.9999956488609314,0.9999912977166758,Positive
Thank you.,SMAR,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan MacWilliams from Stephens. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Great to see dollarbased net retention for customers with greater than 10000 employees at 140 in the quarter. Can you talk about how retention for this segment trended during COVID and maybe how we should think about the retention rate for this segment in a more normalized year Just could be helpful to calibrate the enterprise growth opportunity. Thanks.,SMAR,0.9999992847442628,0.999998569487673,Positive
Ryan this is Pete. So the segment we reported we showed a 140 net dollar retention rate. Like other segments this segment was also hit in terms of where it started. And I would describe it as the effect was less pronounced compared to the segments which had lesser number of employees or smaller segments. So we saw that play out as the first part of it. And then going forward I think its hard to say how this is going to play out. We have built sort of some modest improvement into our guide as weve given that to all of you.,SMAR,0.9906395673751832,0.9812791235918545,Positive
I appreciate that. And Pete once again welcome on board. After strong results in the quarter whats your thoughts on net free cash flow for this year as you look to capitalize on this enterprise opportunity with larger customers Thanks.,SMAR,0.9978530406951904,0.9957060788310044,Positive
So as I stepped into the job as CFO 90 days Ive really developed a level of confidence around the business. And I believe as I said the growth opportunity in the longterm requires a nearterm investment. So our plan is to follow our philosophy of go after the longterm growth opportunity while keeping an eye on the free cash flow side of it. So if you looked at our model I believe we have the  Im confident our model has the ability to generate free cash flow at scale. And as you look at that going forward weve actually guided to sort of a free cash flow improvement from minus 8 in fiscal year 2021 to half that at minus 5 of the midpoint of our guidance as a way to sort of express what I just called out.,SMAR,0.9999595880508424,0.99991917605351,Positive
Appreciate the color. Congrats again.,SMAR,0.9941068291664124,0.9882136513076134,Positive
Thank you.,SMAR,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks. Mark you mentioned a very strong federal close. Im curious if you could just walk us through the next chapter for federal. And when you look even outside the U.S. where are you seeing pockets of opportunity on the federal space,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I think on the federal side I had commentary on our yearoveryear growth. And we did see nice progression throughout the year. One of the really big milestones for us was getting the IL4 provisional authorization. Were going through the technical work to actually get the platforms connected now so we can move to serving our first IL4based customer. And I think that sets a really good foundation for selling next year right. So thats both on the agency side that sort of the  on the military side as well as defense side as well as on the nondefense agency front. So have high expectations for that again.,SMAR,0.9969009160995485,0.9938018285046988,Positive
I think in other growth markets for us Pete alluded to the extension of our cloud platform over in Europe. Were seeing opportunity with larger cap European companies who I would say are more conservative around the data residency front. And I think having done all the work on moving to public cloud last year the lift we have to achieve that this year is a far less. Still a lift but we are really well positioned for that. So I would highlight those as probably the two biggest opportunities.,SMAR,0.0009239315986633,-0.9981533277948665,Negative
And just Pete just a quick followup. I think you mentioned 25 more headcount in the first half of the year. Can you just recap where you ended the fullyear in terms of growth for the last fiscal year,SMAR,0.2122008800506591,-0.5755991790289756,Negative
So I want to make sure I got your question Brent. Are you talking about growth in billings Are you talking about growth in revenue  in headcount okay.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I think in headcount yes.,SMAR,0.8580565452575684,0.716112921305252,Positive
So our headcount for sales was about 360 heads. And essentially when I was referencing the 25 growth I was working off that number.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. And in the growth rate that from the last fiscal year did you have that growth If not we can circle back and just wanted to be clear what the growth was on that,SMAR,0.960834503173828,0.9216689596587178,Positive
So remember last year we had a growth profile which was similar but in the middle of the year as the pandemic hit we made the decision to stay with our capacity additions and stay point in our investment. So as we go into the next fiscal year we are adding resources on top of a capacity model we built through the start of this year  through the start of fiscal year 2021.,SMAR,0.9533097743988036,0.9066194931384879,Positive
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.,SMAR,0.9994659423828124,0.998931884128978,Positive
Of course.,SMAR,0.9554351568222046,0.9108702605189445,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open.,SMAR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could kind of unpack the billings guidance for the fullyear a little bit obviously youre guiding to a nice reacceleration off of the growth you put up this year. And I imagine youre assuming churn rates kind of improve. Theres probably some impact from the acquisition you made. But maybe just help us understand kind of what are the bigger factors driving that improved outlook particularly the accelerated trajectory,SMAR,0.9998685121536256,0.9997370241505055,Positive
So we were really pleased with our billings performance in Q4 and it spoke to some of the indicators that are important to this business. As were thinking about this business in fiscal year 2022 theres two elements that are important. As you think of billings you should think of them as renewals expansions and new business. So we are feeling really bullish on the expansions and new business based on our Q4 performance and the trend were carrying forward.,SMAR,0.9279632568359376,0.8559264277973342,Positive
On the renewals that creates  renewals from last year are based on bookings that we did in fiscal year 2021 which represents a renewable opportunity for us in fiscal year 2022 and therefore billings in fiscal year 2022. We look at that headwind we had in what I call fiscal year 2021 and thats going to play itself out into our billings for fiscal year 2022. So on the sum of it I would say really positive on the new business and expansion billings and a headwind on the billings from last year that carry forward. Now that headwind will probably be more manifest in the first half of the year rather than the fullyear and then sort of ease out or normalize.,SMAR,0.9883016347885132,0.9766032556314801,Positive
Great. And I apologize if I missed it earlier. But just on some of the changes youre doing to pricing and packaging is there any way to think about the impact of that the potential benefit on that either this year or next year if its kind of a longerterm dynamic,SMAR,0.8202565908432007,0.6405129674154326,Positive
Well I would say that we believe that removing friction and make it easier for customers to expand and leverage our premium capabilities to build solutions. I mean were making that investment because we believe it will accelerate growth and help customers but we have not  were not disclosing kind of what we think the impact of those individual changes would be on the growth rate but it is built into our forecast right now.,SMAR,0.977494478225708,0.9549889296227274,Positive
Okay. Thank you very much.,SMAR,0.9836810827255248,0.9673621459973727,Positive

These include driving productivity to enhance margins reinvesting in marketing and innovation to accelerate revenue growth and continuing to make strategic acquisitions. Im proud to say that we have made significant progress across all three.,UTZ,0.999974250793457,0.9999485015562186,Positive
In 2020 including the impact of Truco we grew retail sales 15 as a combined company to over 1.3 billion outpacing salty snack category growth of 9. Utz is now the number three ranked brand platform in US salty snacks and one of the fastestgrowing salty snack platforms of scale.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our power brands sales momentum continued with retail sales growing 17 for the year and now representing close to 90 of our sales. Our footprint continues to extend further beyond our core geographies with nearly 20 growth in the expansion in emerging regions more than double the growth rate of the salty snacks category.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And finally we are one of the fastestgrowing competitors of scale in salty snacks ecommerce with over 120 growth in retail sales yearoveryear. Ecommerce now represents nearly 7 of our sales mix on a retail basis and we will continue to drive meaningful growth in this important and expanding channel. Of particular importance to our longterm growth potential during the year we added over three million buyers almost two times the next closest competitor.,UTZ,0.9687042236328124,0.9374084099581299,Positive
As COVID19 changed habits and elevated at home consumption we have executed extraordinarily well in capturing incremental demand and buyer attention. Importantly these incremental buyers have been sticky in our repeat rate or the proportion of buyers who purchased its products two or more times in the period grew to nearly 70 in 2020. We continue to believe that the increase in athome food consumption that we have seen this past year will continue into 2021 and will benefit us and our dynamic brands over the longterm.,UTZ,0.1032065451145172,-0.7935879788327092,Negative
To help capitalize on this retention opportunity and consistent with the strategy weve outlined since going public in the fourth quarter we began to accelerate our marketing investments focused primarily on digital social and ecommerce and targeted to drive growth and retention. We are seeing strong returns and our ability to measure the effectiveness of the spend means we believe we can adjust our strategies appropriately as we move forward.,UTZ,0.9993826150894164,0.9987652294428522,Positive
Wrapping up our 2020 highlights we delivered positive gross margin expansion and we continue to make meaningful progress on productivity initiatives heading into 2021. Finally we continue to execute on our strategy of making strategic acquisitions focused on U.S. branded snacking and delivering strong synergies and in February of this year 2021 we closed on the acquisition of Vitners our third acquisition since going public. Vitners is a leading regional brand of snack foods in the Chicago metropolitan geography and it provides us with a strong DSD presence with approximately 55 DSD routes. Vitners delivered approximately 25 million in net sales and 3.4 million in pro forma adjusted EBITDA in 2020 and we expect it will be accretive to earnings in 2021 and beyond.,UTZ,0.9724453687667848,0.9448907046858699,Positive
Our acquisitions of H.K. Anderson ON THE BORDER tortilla chips and dips and Vitners will collectively enhance our geographic footprint enable us to drive increased penetration of our power brands and enhance our strength in key products of categories. We remain confident in our ability to execute future strategic acquisitions in 2021 and beyond that add longterm strategic value to our company and tortillas platform.,UTZ,0.997979998588562,0.9959599947690934,Positive
Next Ill shift my comments to the fourth quarter of 2020. And then Ill turn the call over to Cary who will discuss our financial results in more detail and our outlook for 2021. Looking at the numbers in the fourth quarter our financial results were very strong with net sales growing over 22 and nearly 7 on a pro forma basis which excludes the 53rd week in Q4 and it assumes that we own the Conagra DSD snacks Kitchen Cooked H.K. Anderson and Truco for the entirety of Q4 of 2020 and the full year of 2019 and 2020.,UTZ,0.0384780466556549,-0.9230450529128629,Negative
Adjusted gross profit margins increased approximately 155 basis points to 36.7 for the quarter leading to yearoveryear growth in adjusted gross profit of 27.5. In addition adjusted EBITDA margins increased yearoveryear to 13.8 of sales. From a retail sales perspective our strong momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Our retail sales increased 9.3 for the 13 weeks ending December 27th versus category growth of 7.1. We outperformed the category by approximately 220 basis points overall resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter of share gains. For the year we grew 15.1 materially outpacing category growth of 9.1.,UTZ,0.9979748129844666,0.9959496235547207,Positive
Turning to the growth drivers in the quarter we grew sales in five of our six key sub  salty subcategories including tortilla chips led by the ON THE BORDER brand where sales grew over 22 more than tripling the subcategory growth of 7. From a share perspective we gained share across potato chips tortilla chips and Pork Rinds in the quarter which are more than 65 of our retail sales. In potato chips we drove doubledigit growth which was nearly double the category as we continue to increase distribution of our flagship Utz brand outside of our core regions and Zapps remained on its doubledigit growth trajectory. Tangential to the salty subcategories we also grew our Salsa and Queso subcategories by 52 and 38 respectively in Q4 2020 and we expect strong continued growth from these subcategories going forward.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Moving to our brand portfolio groupings. Retail sales for our power brands grew over 11 for the quarter significantly outpacing the category at 7.1. For the fiscal year we grew power brands by 17 almost twice the categorys growth rate and our Foundation Brands grew 3.2. Foundation Brands slightly declined in the quarter as this is consistent with our strategy to continue to emphasize our power brands. To that end in 2020 we eliminated approximately 85 Foundation SKUs totaling nearly 10 million in run rate sales.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond focusing our marketing and innovation efforts around our power brands remains a critical focus for our company. In the developing BetterforYou segment of salty snacks our BetterforYou power brands of Boulder Canyon and Good Health grew retail sales in the natural channel over 16 in the quarter and 21 for the year significantly outpacing natural channel category growth of 9 and 11 respectively.,UTZ,0.9463844299316406,0.8927687959485029,Positive
In the natural channel our topselling brand is Boulder Canyon which delivered a phenomenal year growing over 40 in 2020 delivering the number one selling potato chip SKU in the natural channel which is the Boulder Canyon Avocado Oil Sea Salt. We are leveraging Boulders strong BetterforYou credentials and have early launches in place for innovation to include protein puffs amongst others.,UTZ,0.9962986707687378,0.9925973371251446,Positive
We expect momentum to continue in 2021 as these brands continue to gain traction and we are planning to introduce more innovation to continue to grow the base business. 2020 was a transformative year for us in many respects but in particular introducing our brand portfolio to new buyers. In 2020 we saw significant growth in households buying our product with higher dollars per buyer being spent and increasing rates of repurchase. We grew buyers by more than three million for the 52 weeks ending December 27 2020 versus the prior year which is nearly two times more than any other salty snack competitor during this period.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Moreover our rates of repurchase increased yearoveryear to 70 suggesting stickiness for this increase in the number of households. Weve seen the total number of buyers growing throughout 2020 and coupled with increasing repeat rates we continue to gain confidence about what this means for the companys longterm growth prospects. Importantly this growth in buyers was diversified across age and income demographics as well as geographies.,UTZ,0.9852501153945924,0.9705002132059417,Positive
From a channel perspective grocery mass and club continued to drive our retail sales growth. In addition consistent with our strategy of expanding and underpenetrated channels we gained share in convenience where we are currently underweight notwithstanding overall COVIDrelated softness in this channel as well as in our largest channel grocery which showed strong growth throughout COVID. We grew retail sales in the grocery channel by 14 in the quarter and growth in mass and club was strong at approximately 8 and 12 respectively.,UTZ,0.9864811897277832,0.9729623633398792,Positive
During this quarter we also successfully continued our strategy of geographic expansion as we experienced strong growth in our expansion in emerging regions while also performing well in our core geographies where our retail sales grew nearly 6. Expansion grew about 14 in the quarter versus category growth of 8 and emerging grew over 14 compared to category growth of approximately 7.,UTZ,0.9632011651992798,0.9264022865309038,Positive
For the year we grew core expansion and emerging 12 20 and 19 respectively. We are number two in our core but we are only number four and number five in expansion and emerging markets signaling continued opportunity to grow our sales. This significant growth and expansion in emerging is particularly exciting given they now only comprise 50 of our total retail sales and that includes the impact of the OnTheBorder acquisition.,UTZ,0.9577186107635498,0.9154371711237259,Positive
We continue to benefit from the geographic expansion efforts that have been underway at us for decades. Our acquisitions have helped fuel this expansion and our ability to leverage the footprint gained by our acquisitions to create incremental growth for our power brands has proven to be a very effective strategy.,UTZ,0.9591593742370604,0.918318699788272,Positive
Importantly while we have been successful in driving above category growth in both emerging and expansion regions our sales within each represent less than 5 of the overall category sales and this is less than the 9 in our core market. This reinforces our belief in the distribution runway we have for the future.,UTZ,0.8626207113265991,0.7252412588842265,Positive
Turning to ecommerce this channel continues to be an area of hyper growth for our company. We finished the year as one of the fastestgrowing salty snack companies of scale in ecommerce with sales growing over 120 and nearly doubling to nearly 7 of our total retail sales. We continue to expand our assortments and we are growing across pureplay ecommerce platforms clickandcollect and traditional grocery ecommerce.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Looking ahead we have recently revamped our website and have launched our D2C platform that is intended to create a more userfriendly experience and is better optimized for mobile all enhancing our path to purchase. Supporting these efforts will be our marketing agency of record the Sasha Group who has significant experience in ecommerce and in digital and social platforms.,UTZ,0.9999128580093384,0.9998257159147954,Positive
Before I turn the call over to Cary I just want to thank our entire team for their commitment during a challenging environment and a transformational year for us. This is a testament to the passion and the tenacity of the Utz culture and on behalf of our management team and our Board of Directors Id like to thank you again for your incredible efforts. Cary,UTZ,0.9959346055984496,0.9918692063505685,Positive
Thank you Dylan and good morning everyone. As Dylan mentioned earlier in the quarter we delivered strong topline and bottomline growth that was in line with our expectations. Net sales increased 22.1 to 246.3 million. Gross profit increased 27.4 to 90.5 million and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to 34 million.,UTZ,0.982015073299408,0.9640301251590997,Positive
As you know calendar 2020 was a 53week year and adjusting for the impact of the extra week and the impact of acquisitions pro forma net sales on a comparable 13week basis increased 6.8 in the quarter. For the full year pro forma net sales increased 11.9 and adjusted EBITDA grew 54.8 with margins expanding over 260 basis points to 13.9 of sales.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
These results are a reflection of the teams consistency of execution as we delivered categoryleading sales growth and margin expansion amidst the challenges of COVID19 going public and three strategic acquisitions. This speaks to the relentless spirit and culture of the Utz organization and our unwavering focus on delivering for our customers and our shareholders.,UTZ,0.8755215406417847,0.7510429328935939,Positive
Moving to the details our net sales growth in the quarter was driven by volume of 4.1 pricemix of 1 the extra week of 7.9 and acquisitions of 10.6 partially offset by the impact of higher discounts to independent operators which reduced the net sales growth rate by 1.5.,UTZ,0.8849142789840698,0.7698284207751875,Positive
As a reminder we are in the process of converting companyowned DSD routes to independent operator routes. And as we make these conversions we no longer incur certain selling costs such as route commission compensation benefits and transportation cost but instead we pay a sales discount to independent operators. This has the effect of decreasing net sales and gross profit but we believe it results in higher EBITDA and margins over the longterm.,UTZ,0.8828375339508057,0.7656749282329847,Positive
Moving down the PL we had a very strong margin performance in the quarter. Our growth in adjusted gross profit margin of approximately 155 basis points led to an increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 555 basis points to 13.8. As a reminder prior year margins were impacted by the timing of certain selling expenses that we dont expect to recur and drove a portion of the expansion yearoveryear.,UTZ,0.9399554133415222,0.8799107551042766,Positive
Dissecting the increase in adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter a bit volume contributed approximately 130 basis points of margin growth as we leveraged higher volumes in our manufacturing facilities. Pricemix contributed approximately 80 basis points of margin growth. Acquisitions contributed approximately 140 basis points of margin growth. Cost of goods sold contributed approximately 80 basis points of growth as we experienced lower commodity costs due to strong proactive supply chain execution which locked in favorable contracts that benefited our 2020 results.,UTZ,0.9970812797546388,0.9941625560298899,Positive
The 53rd week drove approximately 100 basis points in margin expansion. And finally selling and admin expense was relatively marginneutral in the quarter as we had higher incentive compensation due to strong performance and higher marketing and ecommerce spend both offset by lower selling expenses and synergy realization. For the year selling and admin expense was higher due to the full year impact of higher incentive compensation and marketing and ecommerce spend.,UTZ,0.0050047636032104,-0.9899916589210386,Negative
Moving to our balance sheet and other key points. As of fiscal yearend our liquidity remains strong and we had a cash balance of 46 million in availability on our ABL credit facility of approximately 106 million. After yearend and as we previously announced on January 20th we completed a term loan refinancing and placed a new 720 million term loan B.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
This new term loan coupled with exercising the public warrants which brought in approximately 180 million in cash enabled us to repay in full the 490 million bridge credit facility used to fund the acquisition of Truco Enterprises and the ON THE BORDER brand and refinance the preexisting 410 million term loan B due 2024.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Importantly this refinancing lowered our expected cash interest cost by over 3 million annually lengthened our maturity profile by over three years to 2028 and provides our business with additional financial flexibility to support our continued longterm growth.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Pro forma for this financing and the Truco acquisition our net debt at fiscal yearend 2020 was approximately 692 million or 3.7 times normalized further adjusted EBITDA of 186 million which assumes Truco and H.K. Anderson were on the entire year as well as including 5 million in run rate cost synergies related to Truco.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Before I discuss our outlook for 2021 Id like to provide an update on two strategic projects that will improve our infrastructure and help enable our platform to continue scaling.,UTZ,0.9414842128753662,0.8829683559944368,Positive
First is our ERP implementation. We have completed the phase deployment across our network and our final modules were stood up in February of 2021. This has been a twoyear process for the business and we are excited to begin taking advantage of the incremental analytics and efficiency that a single integrated current state ERP system can deliver. We will also benefit from key employees across functional areas of the business returning from focus on the ERP to helping drive daytoday execution.,UTZ,0.9946458339691162,0.9892916615555654,Positive
Second after a brief pause last year to accommodate the COVID19 impact and the ERP implementation we resumed our conversion from companyowned routes to independent operators and we expect to finish the conversion in the first half of 2022.,UTZ,0.1811025738716125,-0.6377958284591607,Negative
As weve spoken to before we believe the IO conversion strategy is incremental to longterm organic growth is accretive to EBITDA margins and cash flow and helps derisk our business overall. We look forward to completing this initiative which has been ongoing for several years now and well also continue to look for opportunities to increase our IO route count by adding new organic routes over time.,UTZ,0.99978506565094,0.9995701310456582,Positive
Turning to guidance. We are looking forward to another strong year for us with our momentum continuing into 2021. We expect full year 2021 net sales to be consistent with 2020 pro forma net sales of 1.16 billion.,UTZ,0.9511204957962036,0.9022409333234629,Positive
For clarity our 2020 pro forma net sales is on a 52week comparison basis assumes we owned H.K Anderson and Truco on the first day of fiscal 2020 and assumes 20 million of net sales for Vintners to align with expectations for fiscal 2021 which will have 11 months of results and be impacted by SKU rationalization activity.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Importantly we expect modest organic sales growth yearoveryear even as we lap fiscal 20 organic growth of over 8. As expected due to the COVID19 impact on athome consumption in 2020 our 2021 pro forma net sales guidance is below our longterm growth algorithm. But importantly on a twoyear stack basis this results in pro forma sales growth of about 6 well above our longterm algorithm of 3 to 4 which remains firmly intact.,UTZ,0.9473708868026732,0.8947417108665172,Positive
We began the year with good momentum with strong retail sales growth through February and we expect full year 2021 organic growth led by incremental distribution innovation and pricemix partially offset by the COVID19related lap and our continued DSD route conversion to independent operators.,UTZ,0.9782556295394896,0.9565112331576542,Positive
Moving to adjusted EBITDA. We expect a range of 180 million to 190 million versus 2020 further adjusted EBITDA of 181 million delivering a margin of approximately 16. Included in our 2021 assumptions is the contribution of 48 million to 52 million from our acquisitions of H.K. Anderson Truco and Vitners excluded from these numbers are run rate cost synergies from acquisitions of at least 5 million.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We expect to accomplish the actions to pull through most of these cost synergies by the end of the second quarter of 2022 which is within the range of 12 to 18 months we typically have experienced over our acquisition history.,UTZ,0.1764804124832153,-0.6470401567460041,Negative
Included in our EBITDA assumption is commodity inflation of about 4 and we are focused on pricing to offset this cost pressure. Additionally we expect to increase productivity from 1 to 2 of cost of goods sold which helps to offset inflation and fund incremental marketing spend.,UTZ,0.1697300672531128,-0.6605408552532526,Negative
Finally and as I mentioned earlier we are in the process of converting routes from companyowned to independent operator and this conversion increases the rate of growth for sales discounts which negatively impacts net sales and gross profit.,UTZ,0.995140790939331,0.99028157608603,Positive
For adjusted EPS we expect a range of 0.70 to 0.75 which assumes fully diluted shares on an as converted basis of 142 million and exclude stepup depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense.,UTZ,0.9168439507484436,0.8336878023670926,Positive
Lastly a few additional assumptions for consideration. First we funded the 25 million Vitners acquisition in February 2021 with balance sheet cash. We are expecting 200 to 250 independent operator route conversions in 2021.,UTZ,0.8557702302932739,0.7115402886511615,Positive
We expect core DA of 25 million to 27 million and stepup DA of 57 million to 59 million which are both comprised of approximately twothirds cost of goods sold and onethird selling and administrative expense.,UTZ,0.7925004363059998,0.5850006252530964,Positive
We expect capital expenditures of 30 million to 40 million as we look to invest behind our productivity program and lean into 2022 targets. We expect cash interest expense of approximately 30 million. We expect an effective cash tax rate of 23 to 25 which is the percentage of pretax book income we expect to manifest into cash tax payments. And we expect to end the year with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.5 times. That includes unrealized cost synergies of approximately 5 million from acquisitions.,UTZ,0.9733460545539856,0.9466920773339733,Positive
Diving into our productivity assumptions included in our outlook for 2021 incremental productivity efforts are cornerstone of driving higher margins and we expect meaningful progress towards our 2023 goal of 3 to 4 productivity of cost of goods sold.,UTZ,0.8767958879470825,0.7535916290233309,Positive
This year we expect to double our productivity from 1 to 2 and breaking down the savings we expect 40 to come from manufacturing 30 from product design 20 from network optimization and 10 from sourcing.,UTZ,0.7559244632720947,0.5118486355833027,Positive
A dedicated team to drive this incremental productivity has been up and running for some time. We know the projects that will drive our 2021 productivity rampup and we are planning for an additional rampup in 2022.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Also included in our 2021 outlook is an assumption for increased investments in marketing and innovation. In 2021 we expect a significantly higher mix of digital and ecommerce spending and a lower mix of sponsorship spending and we expect to increase our working digital and ecommerce media spend by approximately 60 relative to 2020 levels and over 275 relative to 2019 levels.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We will continue to allocate most working media to digital and ecommerce as these strategies allow us to remain nimble measure the return on spending and have proven to drive buyer growth and retention.,UTZ,0.9780561923980712,0.9561123586370697,Positive
From an innovation perspective we have an exciting slate of new products in fiscal 2021 across brands and subcategories. To touch on a few first we are introducing twisters flavored pretzels.,UTZ,0.9993566274642944,0.9987132541616286,Positive
This is a subcategory of U.S. salty snacks that grew approximately 30 in 2020. And represents around 35 of the total subcategory according to IRI but is only 10 of Utzs pretzel mix.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our rich history in the pretzel subcategory positions us well to make this a new permanent part of our product portfolio that should drive meaningful growth. We are also introducing onthego products like our cheese pourables.,UTZ,0.9999175667762756,0.9998351334542832,Positive
As you know cheese balls are a strong product for us. But today are almost entirely sold in large barrels mostly in mass and club. Pourables is a product that is more on the go and appropriate for Cstore and impulse in grocery and other channels.,UTZ,0.2114464044570922,-0.5771081311155148,Negative
And lastly we have launched peanut butterfilled pretzels under the Utz Brand. This is an extension of the capabilities we acquired with H.K. Anderson. And we have high expectations for growth and innovation across both the H.K. Anderson and Utz Brands.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Early results are strong. And we will continue to innovate around the filled pretzel platform. In addition we have a wide range of other innovations like protein snacks new flavors and textures and our 100year anniversary special products.,UTZ,0.9642279148101808,0.9284557869766876,Positive
In summary this year we will continue to build on our strong foundation and execute against our strategic priorities that we believe will enhance shareholder value. As we move throughout 2021 we will balance actions that strengthen our fundamentals and create stronger margins longterm while driving strategies that advance our multifaceted growth opportunities.,UTZ,0.999965250492096,0.9999305009427673,Positive
Now Id like to turn the call back over to Dylan for some closing remarks.,UTZ,0.9101122617721558,0.8202244163897134,Positive
Thanks Cary. Looking ahead to 2021 we are focused on actively deploying our longterm value creation strategies of generating productivity gains and reducing costs to enhance margins reinvesting these gains to accelerate our revenue growth and continuing to make strategic acquisitions.,UTZ,0.998382806777954,0.9967656116280623,Positive
Our goal remains to be the fastest growing pureplay branded snack platform of scale in the U.S. And we believe that our longterm sales and earnings growth outlook remains firmly intact. As Cary mentioned earlier our longerterm annual growth outlook is for 3 to 4 organic growth.,UTZ,0.9955173134803772,0.9910346216169725,Positive
We delivered growth significantly above this in 2020 as COVID19 changed habits and elevated athome consumption. Through the combination of the strength of our brands our dedicated associate base and our worldclass distribution system we capitalize on this opportunity and delivered for our customers.,UTZ,0.9842238426208496,0.968447666435043,Positive
In 2021 we will look to maintain this momentum as we remain extremely well positioned for longterm growth. And Ill touch briefly on just a few of the key factors that support this.,UTZ,0.8629791736602783,0.7259581839789058,Positive
First we gained a significant amount of new buyers in the salt and snack category and our repeat rates are increasing. This year we are focused on retaining and recruiting these new buyers and will elevate our digital and socialoriented marketing spend to continue to raise customer awareness of our power brands to leverage these new customer relationships.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Of note On The Border was the number one tortilla chip brand in terms of buyer retention in 2020. And we expect these buyers to remain loyal customers in 2021 and beyond.,UTZ,0.9393202662467957,0.8786404601576687,Positive
Second we have significant opportunity in terms of geographic white space and underpenetrated channels. As I noted earlier our share in emerging and expansion geographies is below 5 which is significantly below our share in core geographies of nearly 9.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We have a tried and true strategy of building strong relations and relationships with national retailers that have both regional influence and relevance. And we will leverage these relationships with our higher brand marketing support.,UTZ,0.9980663061141968,0.9961326099232495,Positive
Mass and Cstore channels remain large opportunities for us. And the acquisition of the On The Border brand for example will help further Utzs growth in these key channels.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Third our productivity efforts via a virtuous cycle of value creation will help to fuel incremental marketing and innovation to accelerate revenue growth. We plan to invest more in our brands in a more targeted way. And these higher marketing dollars will support geographic expansion and brand building tactics.,UTZ,0.99078631401062,0.981572617037664,Positive
Fourth our infrastructure improvements will enable the Utz platform to continue to scale to greater heights.,UTZ,0.9377347230911256,0.8754693719562128,Positive
As Cary mentioned earlier we are implementing a new ERP system and we continue to convert to our DSD routes to independent operators. And additionally our new lowcost debt structure will provide increased financial flexibility lastly we will continue to make strategic acquisitions that deliver strong synergies and that enhance our competitive positioning. Our strategy remains consistent as we are focused on branded snacking in the US at attractive valuations that are accretive.,UTZ,0.99863600730896,0.997272012991913,Positive
On that note our pipeline remains very active. And important to note we are very excited to recognize the fact that Utz is officially 100 years old as a company this fall. Almost a century ago in November of 1921 Bill and Salie Utz started making and selling potato chips in Hanover Pennsylvania. Im extremely proud of the generations of families and Utz associates who have put decades of effort into making Utz a successful thriving company with a strong roadmap for future growth.,UTZ,0.9999932050704956,0.999986410132891,Positive
I see no limit to our future success and I thank our associates our customers and our consumers for your continued support of Utz in our entire brand portfolio. Again thank you very much for joining us today. We are excited about everyone who has become a shareholder of Utz and we look forward to continuing to create value for all of our stakeholders.,UTZ,0.9999256134033204,0.9998512267179651,Positive
Id now like to ask the operator to open the call for questions.,UTZ,0.9289289712905884,0.857857857857858,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew your line is open.,UTZ,0.9998700618743896,0.999740123593881,Positive
Hi good morning everyone.,UTZ,0.9790838956832886,0.9581677664326229,Positive
Good morning.,UTZ,0.97207772731781,0.9441554213496572,Positive
Hi there. Dylan you talked about how in Utzs core markets the company gained share for the full year. It looked like in 4Q specifically though in those core markets share took a bit of a  it looks like you lost a little bit of share in 4Q. So a little bit of an inflection. Trying to get a sense of what drove that shift And maybe more importantly how you see core market share sort of moving forward,UTZ,0.9581790566444396,0.9163580634344,Positive
Yeah. Hey Andrew thanks very much. And youre right on a full year basis the core did extremely well right The Utz Brands platform did about 12 against a market of approximately 9 but as to your point for sure in Q4 we had a little bit of a slowdown there relative to the market. We came in about 5.7 compared to 6.7. So in our core markets if you look at the PowerPoint presentation we have online sort of jumps around from the PAC Northwest to New Orleans to the midAtlantic to New England.,UTZ,0.9984470009803772,0.9968940001094342,Positive
So its a vary geography and you can really dial into specific geographies and see where on a yearoveryear basis we have opportunity for improvement. Its a big part of our focus. Were laserfocused on it. We know that the core is as important as any of the growth that we have in emerging and expansion markets. Theres a little bit of noise in the Q4 just from some holiday overlaps some channel exposure heavier exposure to Cstore under penetration in mass in some of those core markets so its a hotchpotch of different reasons but it still grew almost 6.,UTZ,0.9861642122268676,0.972328407960181,Positive
So were excited about 2021. I think as we look forward into the future 2021 is just an area for us to get laserfocused on what markets what accounts within those markets what channels what accounts within those channels that we need to focus on. And so were putting a laser focus on that. And just very importantly our overarching objectives are that we want to gain share in our core. So if share is going to go up 2 or 3 or sales is going to go 2 or 3 we need to beat that in our course. So thats where were laserfocused going into 2021.,UTZ,0.9992533326148988,0.9985066643397003,Positive
Okay. Thank you for that. And then I guess lastly I know the company has previously spoken of a midteen EBITDA margin target for I think it was discussed as sort of the medium term. And with now looking like Utz will hit this target in 2021 due partly to the acquisition of the highermargin Truco business. I guess does the company have an updated view on its mediumterm margin potential Thank you.,UTZ,0.9992407560348512,0.9984815111646126,Positive
Hey Andrew this is Cary. Great question. Were not updating the target per se. I mean I think its safe to say that 16 EBITDA margin is the new baseline from which to grow from I think with our price pack initiatives with our productivity with our IO conversions coming to a completion here in the next 18 months plus with longterm profitable branded volume growth. All that is marginaccretive and then you layer in synergies we pull through in acquisitions. That is a lot of ammunition to kind of march it forward from a baseline of 16.,UTZ,0.9999476671218872,0.9998953341813888,Positive
Got it. Thank you.,UTZ,0.9929356575012208,0.985871306581084,Positive
Thank you.,UTZ,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh your line is open.,UTZ,0.9027792811393738,0.8055584463825503,Positive
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Dylan I wanted to go to your slide just showing the subcategory sales growth rate in the tortilla chips category you guys significantly outgrew the category. I was curious in terms of what the drivers there were in terms of the outperformance and then do you expect this outperformance to continue into 2021,UTZ,0.9653363227844238,0.9306726042464997,Positive
Yes. Thanks for the question. Thats the slide on the presentation 6 yes tortilla chips did fantastic as you can tell. Most of that Rupesh is driven by the ON THE BORDER brand but also importantly is our Tortiyahs Brand which is a legacy brand that is up well over 100 as well.,UTZ,0.9987332820892334,0.9974665626684205,Positive
So Truco ON THE BORDER which we acquired back in December of 2020 had phenomenal growth in 2020. Its continued its growth trends in 2021. Its coming off a phenomenal year. Tortiyahs continues to grow and continues to gain expansion. So I think when I look at that subcategory of tortillas going into the future into 2021 I think its going to be where it used to be a big weakness.,UTZ,0.9699113965034484,0.939822757138465,Positive
If you remember back in June of 2020 we talked about how we were underpenetrated in the tortilla subcategory. Now I think thats a future and continued strength of Utzs because weve really grown to like the third largest position in tortillas as a subcategory.,UTZ,0.9785680770874025,0.9571361286259465,Positive
Okay. Great. And then maybe just one followup question for Cary. So in regards to your adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is there any granularity you can give us in terms of both gross margins and SGA how to think about it yearoveryear,UTZ,0.998748242855072,0.9974964842179324,Positive
Yes. I think gross margins I think will be consistent with kind of the pro forma gross margin from 2020. So call it 38 area and that applies kind of an adjusted SGA margin of about 22.,UTZ,0.2464809119701385,-0.5070390743250099,Negative
Okay. Great. Thank you. Ill pass it on.,UTZ,0.9963982105255128,0.9927964167573553,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Holland with D.A. Davidson. Brian your line is open.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to just maybe piggyback on Andrews question about the core market performance. Have we seen any change in promotional cadence or intensity in the competitive landscape Im just curious whether that had any impact on what youre seeing,UTZ,0.999875009059906,0.9997500179708112,Positive
I think weve seen a little bit of that Brian. Obviously we did really well throughout 2020 as a brand. It doesnt matter if youre looking at it in any particular geography between core emerging or expansion we did really well. We did really well in almost all of the channels that we operated in 2020. And I think from a competitive standpoint obviously we also went public and we also got on a larger scale and perhaps picked up some more notice from competition.,UTZ,0.9999979734420776,0.9999959468817394,Positive
I think in general terms Ive been at this for 25 years. And I wouldnt say that theres any major shift in promotional strategies across the salted snack category. I think people are looking where they stand in the stack of their share in particular subcategories. If theyre underweight in a certain subcategory if theyre underweight in certain shares looking at ways to perhaps drive share gains but I havent seen any dramatic shifts in pricing relative to that.,UTZ,0.7399097084999084,0.47981910694784347,Positive
And as we look forward into 2021 I think theres opportunity for everyone in the industry to continue to look at price pack architecture and ways to promote and sell and it all comes down to depth and frequency and a multitude of ways to affect ultimate price points.,UTZ,0.1709780097007751,-0.6580449688702636,Negative
I appreciate the color Dylan. And then just moving this forward to 2021 the revenue guide a fairly precise number in whats going to be a very volatile year one would think just compares et cetera and then you obviously have a lot of internal initiatives. So maybe a little more color on how we arrive where we did And so maybe just to help guide that question along. Can Truco for instance or On The Border specifically grow in 2021 And are we thinking about those core markets just being pressured by the COVID comp and thats just fully offset by expansion in emerging market share Because it seems like theres a lot of white space that youll be attacking over the next 12 months,UTZ,0.9690253734588624,0.9380507099930706,Positive
Yes. Great question Brian this is Cary. Yes I would say just a little more color on the revenue guidance. I think we expect modest organic growth and that effectively means Utz. We expect distribution gains which are meaningful as weve been building over time and going to your point about emerging and expansion that will continue to grow and outpace the category and we expect the core to do well as well. But I think distribution by and large will drive modest organic growth for us.,UTZ,0.9998282194137572,0.9996564386227358,Positive
And Truco has a great playbook going forward. Theyve got a lot of new distribution in the food and grocery channel. So theres a lot of runway there but they have a more meaningful COVID lap than Utz does in terms of percentage of total business.,UTZ,0.9503356218338012,0.9006711844630146,Positive
So I think the expectation it lets Utz to grow modestly and were seeing consistent growth for the year. Truco might be flat to down a little bit but thats still very acceptable. Its a great business. Theres a lot of longterm growth ahead of it. We bought it for a really good price. So were very happy with it.,UTZ,0.9999617338180542,0.9999234675904916,Positive
Got it. Thanks. Congrats on a great year gentlemen.,UTZ,0.999831199645996,0.999662399090766,Positive
Thank you.,UTZ,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you.,UTZ,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Michael your line is open.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning. Thank you. You mentioned the favorable contracts you had in 2020. There were a benefit and now of course are part of your comp. Youre guiding the 4 inflation that obviously Im assuming would capture all of that but can you just give a sense of where you sit now in terms of how much is hedged or locked in or kind of what sort of volatility there could be potentially to that 4,UTZ,0.9449522495269777,0.889904433431884,Positive
Yes. Great question Michael. Were about 80 covered for 2021. If you asked me before the Texas freeze what inflation would be for the year we would have probably said less than 4 but that definitely had an impact on the markets and resin prices and thats kind of flowing through to packaging.,UTZ,0.9168024063110352,0.8336047134427509,Positive
And so I think we think we got a really good supply chain team on purchasing. They bought oils really well and were still seeing the benefit of that in 2021. So as you think about inflation this year its primarily in packaging. Id say about half of thats in packaging about 40 is in the cooking oil area because spot prices of cooking oil have gone up but we are largely covered for the year and then 10 in other categories.,UTZ,0.8383274078369141,0.6766546229449648,Positive
Okay great. Thats really helpful. And then just a quick followup on productivity. Youve talked about the momentum there and how that should progress can you just give a little more sense of how much might be reinvested or versus dropping to the bottomline and how you think about taking those benefits,UTZ,0.9999496936798096,0.9998993872996493,Positive
Yes. So a meaningful increase this year. Were effectively doubling the percentage of COGS from 1 to 2 and thats on the US base by the way. And well be run rating higher than 2 as we exit the year but were going to take some of that savings and certainly reinvest in marketing. Were going to spend more this year. Were leaning into digital and social.,UTZ,0.999069333076477,0.998138665043512,Positive
And the digital and ecomm piece of marketing should grow close to 60 this year. So we will take some of that and reinvest in marketing like we said we would but some of its also going to help offset some of the inflationary pressures were seeing this year.,UTZ,0.996517777442932,0.9930355507347288,Positive
Okay great. Thanks so much.,UTZ,0.9981529116630554,0.9963058211242086,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Tim Perz with Stephens Inc. Tim your line is open.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks for the question guys. So I just want to start with a biggerpicture question. I think the key opportunity for us longerterm is growing your number four and five share positions and the expansion in emerging categories. Do you think you have the brands in place today to do that and is the answer really just adding distribution assets in those regions or can you just walk me through how youre thinking about growing your business outside of your core markets,UTZ,0.9989966750144958,0.9979933488329344,Positive
Yes sure. Great question. So I mean if you think about it weve been growing continuously and contiguously across the United States for 100 years more so in the last 10 years where we have been utilizing the MA strategy to grow geographically in many cases right Golden Flake in 2016 the Tims Cascade assets that we acquired in late 2019 in the PAC Northwest great example with Kitchen Cooked in Illinois and Vitners in Illinois. And as we take over and acquire these companies and expand our geographic base we have the opportunity to really push our branding into our Power Brands which is really where we want to focus right,UTZ,0.9978917837142944,0.9957835649153977,Positive
We know that were going to have some negative drag from Foundation Brands because its not where were putting our focus right In the last year or so weve eliminated two or three of those Foundation Brands and they become a negative drag on your retail sales in some cases but youre converting that space into your Power Brands so that when we focus on marketing behind those Power Brands we get the benefit from that.,UTZ,0.031148076057434,-0.9377050028473157,Negative
So as we expand into the southeast as we expand into Florida as we expand into Texas as were currently expanding into Arizona as were increasing our sales and our share in the PAC Northwest as were going into the Midwest.,UTZ,0.9337745308876038,0.8675489828282492,Positive
The Midwest is a huge opportunity for us and showing great results especially with the just consummated acquisition of Vitners that we closed on February 8 of 2021 we are already putting Utz branded products onto that network and pushing those into the Chicago market.,UTZ,0.2224717736244201,-0.555057379637587,Negative
So its really a combination of just using sort of organic sort of zip codebyzip code continuous growth across the US but also some of that leapfrogging that were able to do when we do some of our acquisition strategies to deliver an opportunity. And again I think to Andrews first question without ignoring the fact that we want our core to also gain share over time not just rely of course on emerging or expansion markets.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks. That was helpful. And I just wanted to pivot over to marketing. So you started your relationship with the Sasha Group in October how is that relationship progressing and what have your early learnings been from your recent marketing investment spend,UTZ,0.9997900724411012,0.999580144631949,Positive
Yes. I mean its going very well. I mean what a great dynamic group. And if you remember back to past calls and past conversations what were really trying to do is a spend more money on marketing right than we had historically spent. And when I say spend more money on marketing I mean spend more on traditional digital social type of marketing pulling away from what we have been spending some money on the past which is sponsorships and putting more spend into traditional social digital type of media.,UTZ,0.9998766183853148,0.9997532366235473,Positive
Sasha which is a VaynerX company the Sasha Group is just fantastic at that. And so we have our team that does digital social is fantastic. And I think it sort of shows in some of the ecommerce stuff that we put into our presentation where weve really grown our ecommerce business which is comprised of sort of this is IRI retail ecommerce as its defined by IRI which includes some of this clickandcollect and some of the other methods of getting product to people through ecommerce has really grown over 120plus percent and we expect to continue into 2021 and beyond.,UTZ,0.9981120824813844,0.9962241627121944,Positive
So were really focusing to make sure that were dynamic spending more money significantly more money on social on digital on our brands focusing in on Power Brands making that 360 loop into ecommerce and really driving awareness. And I think through our new households that we picked up and our repeat rates and the things that weve detailed in that presentation as well.,UTZ,0.9993909597396852,0.9987819187533373,Positive
I think you could say that were happy so far. I always say never happy but pleased but not satisfied. Were very pleased but we always think that we can improve and so well spend 2021 trying to improve that even more which is the beauty of the marketing that were doing is that we can literally change daytoday on a dime if we have to spend that money effectively.,UTZ,0.965816855430603,0.9316336701116981,Positive
Thanks guys. Ill pass it along.,UTZ,0.9873644113540648,0.9747288076453253,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert your line is open.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi thanks. A couple of followups. Could you give us a couple more specifics on how youre going to implement pricing this year You mentioned price pack architecture and also depth and frequency of promo to what extent will list prices  list price increases also be in that formula,UTZ,0.9880315065383912,0.976062998809218,Positive
And secondly I wanted a little more depth on ON THE BORDER. And it seems like theres significant revenue synergy opportunities with your Utz distribution platform. Are your Utz salespeople marketing that brand to their customers currently and has that yielded more distribution or is ON THE BORDERs standalone business  is it still kind of operating standalone and it has its own distribution plan Thanks.,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah. Robert Im going to tackle both of those. This is Dylan. I could probably give you 30 minutes on either one of those topics but Ill try to do it in succinct way. In terms of pricing in the snacking industry its a little bit different. Its not just your typical list pricing initiatives. However we have a very robust price pack architecture team that constantly analyzes the opportunities like I mentioned earlier about frequency about depth. We did just do some pricing on March 8th which kicked in. Of course it takes a little while for some of that to flow through the system with contracts and all the specifics of the thousands of accounts that we basically deal with on a daily basis.,UTZ,0.9975697994232178,0.9951395959494089,Positive
So we do have some list and then we also have some weighedout opportunities that were enacting and some different things around that to really try to tackle offsetting some of the inflation concerns. So on that we have a lot of different levers. Were pulling all the levers and were going to continue to lean into those levers on pricing.,UTZ,0.9924583435058594,0.9849166780213583,Positive
Flipping to your commentary about ON THE BORDER and the integration of sales and how that works. As we said at the very beginning we did not look at ON THE BORDER as a cost synergy play from an MA perspective. We looked at it as a revenue synergy play from an MA perspective. So that team continues to sell dayin and dayout to their major customers on a DTW directtowarehouse basis. Thats impact thats going very well they have great leadership they have a great team. If you think about it were months into it right now. Were coalescing very well on all fronts.,UTZ,0.9999582171440125,0.9999164342382159,Positive
Our sales folks its a little bit  you have to unwind in some cases existing distribution and theres some complications there that you just have to unwind with any integration of MA. But for example in Chicago like within weeks of the acquisition being consummated we were taking it through our route system through our thirdparty distributor route system in Chicago into June ph. For example in Central Pennsylvania weve already turned over OTB distribution to the Utz DSD sales system. In Connecticut weve already turned it over to the Utz DSD sales system.,UTZ,0.1973463892936706,-0.605308178250896,Negative
And so as we look forward those opportunities are going to I think be very positive and very accretive to us because the brand sells and its doing really well in the places that weve been able to convert it. And when it is distributed when it is sold if you think about the sales team at OTB I would garner to say theres roughly eight people in sales.,UTZ,0.2253749072551727,-0.5492511089152747,Negative
When you think about the sales team at Utz I would garner to say if you disregard the DSD sales force we still have over 200plus people that sell. So all of them are looking at OTB and its not just tortillas its sauces its dips its cases.,UTZ,0.0038928091526031,-0.992215569147807,Negative
Its all of the product lineup that they have that we can integrate into our almost 1700 DSD routes overtime right And I always think of things in a very longterm perspective that overtime were going to get those wins. And its a great brand and selling well.,UTZ,0.9994664788246156,0.9989329570132239,Positive
Great. Thanks.,UTZ,0.9988770484924316,0.9977540956461999,Positive
Your final question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason your line is open.,UTZ,0.8655942678451538,0.7311883754660937,Positive
Hi. Good morning folks. A couple of quick housekeeping questions first you mentioned contracts and the stepup to 4 inflation from modestly deflationary. Is that going to be a gradual ease in sort of giving you time to adjust if the productivity ramping or are your rollover a cliff it had a little bit of friction on margins as we enter the year,UTZ,0.9999438524246216,0.99988770478231,Positive
I think it will be more second halfweighted. But I think we will see some pressure in the first half of the year. But we have the pricing starting to take effect. And productivity will layer in as well to help offset that and that will be more back halfweighted as well.,UTZ,0.9505671858787536,0.9011343128289655,Positive
Thats helpful. Thank you. And coming back to the marketing question Dylan in your prepared remarks my interpretation what you were saying was you have a pretty big heavyup of retail media on ecom platforms coming next year. Question one is is that right,UTZ,0.9994062781333924,0.9988125555590128,Positive
And second assuming thats the case which I think it is how much of that if any can be funded from trade budgets or is all that investment could be incremental,UTZ,0.9711032509803772,0.9422064675131248,Positive
Yeah. So in the digital and social area we are spending approximately 60 more in 2021 than 2020. Part of that is incremental dollars for sure part of that is also pulling out of sponsorship and moving the mix into more digital and social. So its a significant increase that we are going to layer into that digital social in pure dollars.,UTZ,0.9969175457954408,0.9938350879163076,Positive
Im really just trying to isolate for the retail media component and not the social component. Is there any color you can give Like it seems like your investments against right now or Walmart Connect or Amazon media services which to my ear it sounds like thats where allowance is going to support ecom,UTZ,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah. Well I mean yes and no. It is digital and social. Ill honestly say Jason that I think all of that is interconnected. Ecommerce is not just Amazon. Ecommerce is the clickandcollect at Walmart.,UTZ,0.8405534625053406,0.6811067349354833,Positive
Its the  pulling up to a Kroger and ordering online. And how do you make your products appear by the time you type the words PRE looking for a pretzel how do you make your products appear on the top of that shoppers list and create that stickiness.,UTZ,0.1381084322929382,-0.7237841628695505,Negative
So it is all interconnected. I think its a great question. Its something we could probably follow up on more definitively. But the way that I look at it is its not traditional  were not talking about television advertising. And were not talking about a lot of radio advertising. Were talking about a lot of digital and socialoriented advertising and spending and marketing to promote the brands.,UTZ,0.9987221956253052,0.997444389727348,Positive
No. I hear you. Obviously paid placement paid search those are quite different in social. So thats just why Im trying to wrap my head around it. And sounds like a good opportunity to follow up offline.,UTZ,0.9465473890304564,0.8930947143403971,Positive
Sure sure thing of course.,UTZ,0.8760653734207153,0.7521305990997547,Positive
This concludes our questionandanswer session. I will now turn the call back over to Dylan Lissette for closing remarks.,UTZ,0.2282554507255554,-0.543490018540632,Negative
Thank you very much all for joining us today on this yearend and Q4 2020 call. We are very excited about the future. Were very excited about everyone who has become a shareholder of Utz.,UTZ,0.9995467066764832,0.9990934128125983,Positive
We look forward to continue to create tremendous value for all of our stakeholders. Were very excited about our 100year anniversary. And all of the things that well have going on around that. Its a testament to the company and into our folks and to our people our customers and our consumers. And thank you very much.,UTZ,0.9993233680725098,0.998646735338411,Positive
Ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.,UTZ,0.960799515247345,0.9215989837640428,Positive

At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode. There will be a presentation by the Motus management team followed by a questionandanswer session. I must advise you all that the conference is being recorded.,MOTS,0.9997135400772096,0.9994270798129321,Positive
Id like to turn the call over to Garth Russell of LifeSci Advisors. Please go ahead sir.,MOTS,0.958500325679779,0.9170006018880617,Positive
Thank you Operator and thank you everyone for joining us for the Motus GI Fourth Quarter 2020 Update Call Today. Representing the company are Tim Moran Chief Executive Officer Andy Taylor Chief Financial Officer and Mark Pomeranz President and Chief Operating Officer of Motus GI.,MOTS,0.9989738464355468,0.9979476916478225,Positive
Before I turn the call over to management for their opening remarks I would like to take a minute to remind you that this conference call and webcast will contain certain forwardlooking statements about the company. These statements are subjects to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events to differ.,MOTS,0.9951032400131226,0.9902064741888488,Positive
Please note that these forwardlooking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this call. We will not undertake an obligation to revise or publicly release any results of any revisions to these forwardlooking statements in light of new information or future events.,MOTS,0.9735071659088136,0.947014300235689,Positive
Factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements are discussed in greater detail in our recent filings on Form 10K and other periodic reports on Form 10Q and 8K with the SEC.,MOTS,0.9730980396270752,0.9461960471844955,Positive
I would now like to turn the call to Tim Moran CEO of Motus GI. Tim the floor is yours.,MOTS,0.8762651681900024,0.752530188876503,Positive
Thank you Garth and thank you everyone for joining us today for Motus GIs fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. Ill start todays call by discussing our performance in the fourth quarter provide detail of what were seeing in the broader U.S. hospital market as well as discuss four upcoming value creation drivers that we believe have the potential to greatly enhance our business. Ill then turn the call over to Andrew who will provide a review of our financial performance. At the end of our prepared remarks we will open the call to take your questions.,MOTS,0.9999902248382568,0.9999804496648608,Positive
As a result of COVID19 2020 was a tumultuous year for everyone. However as I reflect on the last 12 months I am pleased to say that despite these challenges our team exhibited impressive resilience which allowed us to advance our strategy and establish a foundation for PureVu in the market. Its important to remind everyone that we are in the early stages of tapping into the opportunity before us.,MOTS,0.9762502908706664,0.9525005534294564,Positive
In terms of market size with more than 50 million procedures per year colonoscopy is one of the single largest procedures in all of Med Tech. The unmet need associated with poor bowel prep is universally recognized both from a clinical and economic perspective.,MOTS,0.1139386892318725,-0.7721236778042782,Negative
The thesis which motivated me to join Motus as its CEO two and a half years ago has not changed. Our PureVu system has clear first mover advantage meaning we believe we currently have no direct competition and we continue to protect our core technologies through a growing portfolio of granted patents.,MOTS,0.2157529592514038,-0.5684950163930752,Negative
The task at hand is now focused on establishing our entry position in this market and changing longstanding behaviors both of which are challenging tasks that require focus patience and deliberate execution. Were asking physicians and their staff to think differently about patient flow with the goal of eliminating archaic and unnecessary delayed hospitalizations due to poor bowel prep.,MOTS,0.0643336772918701,-0.8713337608181004,Negative
This shift in mindset requires an enhanced commitment to improving patient care and a focus towards fixing the unprofitable economics for the hospital under the current standard of care. Moreover addressing unmet needs and solving these clinical challenges requires physicians nurses and support staff to adopt a new technology and learn to utilize it effectively in cases they encounter on a regular basis.,MOTS,0.1606639623641967,-0.6786730758387305,Negative
My experience tells me that changing behaviors doesnt happen overnight it requires tenacity telling the story each and every day and being highly targeted in our approach to influencing one physician at a time. While this process may take longer than wed like it doesnt change what were playing for here establishing PureVu as a new standard of care in the large global colonoscopy market. I am confident that our shareholders our customers and their patients will greatly benefit as we execute toward our goal of long term success.,MOTS,0.9996010065078736,0.9992020125401098,Positive
Id like to highlight the decisive and disciplined approach we have taken in our business since COVID19 began one year ago. We acted with urgency in March and April 2020 cutting our quarterly cash burn by about 50 as the year progressed.,MOTS,0.8592104911804199,0.7184208145265665,Positive
We streamlined our areas of focus and our internal projects continuing only those projects that we believe would enhance our business and help build medium and long term shareholder value. We strengthened our base of shareholders and our balance sheet in 2020 and early 2021 bringing in more than 20 million of additional equity capital. And finally we continue to build strong customer relationships and gained evaluations at more than two dozen targeted hospitals across the U.S.,MOTS,0.9906504154205322,0.9813008196954844,Positive
Despite current market related headwinds which are mainly attributed to COVID19 we are in the strongest financial position since Motus GI was established and are well situated to come out of the other side of this pandemic. We believe our sales and marketing teams nimble approach to remain engaged with keys positions has been very effective particularly when considering the unique environment with lockdowns and social distancing requirements.,MOTS,0.9968048930168152,0.9936097822247638,Positive
In the third quarter we saw a nice rebound in our business primarily driven by an uptick in procedure volume and having onsite access to most of our hospitals. While that trend continued into early Q4 the resurgence of COVID19 in specific geographies particularly California and Texas created a slowdown in our momentum in November and December.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
With that said Im pleased that from a revenue perspective despite the uptick in COVID19 related issues in Q4 we sold more disposable sleeves than in Q3 and conducted roughly as many PureVu procedures.,MOTS,0.944165587425232,0.8883311082906178,Positive
In Q4 we also successfully negotiated two new 12 month committed contracts at prominent medical centers the University of Texas and NYU which are both in effect for 2021. In both instances the customer made a commitment to minimum quarterly purchases for our PureVu sleeves and for doing so we are allowing the early adopters what we are calling centers of excellence to utilize our capital equipment at no additional cost while these minimums are met or exceeded. We believe deploying this razor blade model works well in instances where capital funding is currently unavailable as it permit the customer to expand use of the PureVu system while providing us with more predictable sleeve volumes.,MOTS,0.9988855123519896,0.9977710233754056,Positive
Given the current capital environment we expect to complete additional agreements like these with early adopter hospitals in the first half of the year. You may also recall that University of Texas and NYU are two locations that have implemented a protocol that identifies clear clinical circumstances where the PureVu system should be utilized which is also resulting in more consistent usage patterns. Replicating similar patient identification protocols in additional PureVu site is a key focus for our commercial team.,MOTS,0.9949257373809814,0.9898514687129669,Positive
In the fourth quarter we also expanded our business by initiating product evaluations at new accounts most notably the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and Mass General Hospital in Boston. While we may not see the current environment begin to normalize immediately we believe as hospital access returns and GI procedures rebound to prepandemic levels we are poised to drive an acceleration of PureVu utilization.,MOTS,0.885284423828125,0.7705687109045452,Positive
Due to the pandemic weve yet to benefit from having all of our hospitals fully up and running at any one time over the past year. As part of our fiscal discipline we are currently fielding a small customer facing team. This team is doing a great job driving the result that I summarized and as we see a more favorable environment emerge we will look to thoughtfully invest in expanding our commercial organization with the goal of driving faster utilization and revenue growth.,MOTS,0.9991554021835328,0.9983108033602259,Positive
I want to switch gears to upcoming catalysts for the business. We have identified four value creation drivers that we believe have the potential to meaningfully enhance and accelerate our business in 2021 and beyond. They are reimbursement product innovation clinical data and strategic partnerships.,MOTS,0.902923583984375,0.8058470522445751,Positive
Let me start with reimbursement. In the back half of 2020 we began to develop a comprehensive strategy aimed at positioning PureVu for reimbursement coverage in both the inpatient and the outpatient settings. While there are many pathways to achieve both public and private coverage we are initially focused on CMS programs designed to provide payment for new and unique technologies.,MOTS,0.9573310613632202,0.9146620718610714,Positive
In the fourth quarter we submitted an application to CMS for a new technology addon payment sometimes referred to NTAP. This program could provide reimbursement for PureVu during inpatient colonoscopy. As part of this submission we also applied for an ICD10 code. As you may have seen in a recent press release on March 9 we participated in CMSs Coordination Meeting where I am pleased to share that they recommended PureVu to be considered for an ICD10 code.,MOTS,0.9699735045433044,0.9399469732922157,Positive
CMS is now conducting an open comment period and then the final decision will be made through a subsequent clearing process. If a code is awarded and substantively NTAP coverage we believe adoption and utilization of PureVu in the inpatient market can be accelerated.,MOTS,0.1870660781860351,-0.6258688127212602,Negative
We also submitted an application for CMSs transitional passthrough payment. This program could provide reimbursement for traditional outpatient procedures. We believe high medical need patience that cant successfully complete their preprocedural bowl prep would benefit greatly from PureVu.,MOTS,0.7844979763031006,0.5689956957076165,Positive
Securing passthrough coverage for our system could be a significant catalyst for our business as it would provide economic incentives for physicians to use PureVu on the roughly 5 million high medical need procedures each year in the U.S. It would also mark our first entry into the large outpatient market.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Next Id like to discuss new product innovation. I am pleased to report that our product development efforts to launch our first PureVu system for use in Upper GI endoscopy is on track and we expect to submit a 510K application to the FDA by early Q3. This would potentially position us with an approved and available product on the market by early Q4.,MOTS,0.9999923706054688,0.9999847412018426,Positive
We view this as a significant opportunity and believe our technology can potentially address a serious unmet need in the market as it relates to visualization and the treatment of Upper GI bleeding which has an estimated mortality rate of approximately 10. There are roughly 400000 Upper GI procedures in the U.S. annually and we continue to receive significant inbound interest from GI physicians who are eager for a solution that allows them to clear adherent blood and clots from their field of view during this critical procedure.,MOTS,0.8043807744979858,0.6087613157995437,Positive
Next lets discuss clinical data generation. Im excited to announce today that we recently began enrollment in a study with the Cleveland Clinic which will evaluate the clinical and economic benefits of using the PureVu system in patients with emergent lower GI bleeding that are treated in the ICU or the rapid inpatient endoscopy suite. This study is designed to enroll at least 20 patients to undergo minimal bowel prep in order to provide patients a much faster diagnosis as compared to the current period of 24 to 36 hours or more typically required to complete a full bowl prep.,MOTS,0.9555009603500366,0.9110018676530527,Positive
The outcome we receive from this study could begin to challenge the current standard of care for emergent Lower GI bleed patients who are facing urgent need for diagnosis and treatment but are currently delayed. We expect to have this study fully enrolled before the end of 2021.,MOTS,0.0025360882282257,-0.9949290126139001,Negative
And lastly I want to talk about strategic partnerships. As it relates to our strategic options weve spent time evaluating a number of potential pathways during the back half of 2020 and into 2021. Our objectives in considering any potential partnership would be aimed at opportunities that could accelerate our commercial efforts and enhance our technology development. Any partnership would also need to unlock clear shareholder value. As we continue to grow awareness and uptake of the PureVu system we will consider which options best fit our criteria and are actionable.,MOTS,0.998282551765442,0.9965651014835251,Positive
I will now ask Andrew to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Andrew.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Andrew Taylor,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Tim and thank you everyone for joining us today. We reported revenue for the fourth quarter 2020 of approximately 36000 primarily from the sales of PureVu singleuse sleeves.,MOTS,0.9935879707336426,0.987175933823546,Positive
As Tim discussed our small commercial organization has been focused on single use sleeve sales with early adopter hospitals that are starting to implement PureVu patient protocol. Growth in the fourth quarter was impacted by the surge in COVID19 cases and the effect on new technology utilization in the inpatient environment.,MOTS,0.0391972661018371,-0.9216066131631215,Negative
Over the course of 2021 we expect to grow our number of new system placement and work with hospital value analysis committee to finalize commercial contract at our active sites. We anticipate new and reorders of PureVu sleeves to increase during 2021 and to pursue capital equipment purchases leases or rentals with targeted accounts.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the three months ended December 31 2020 we recorded a net loss of approximately 4.4 million or a net loss per diluted share of 0.12 compared to 5.9 million or a net loss per diluted share of 0.21 for the same period last year.,MOTS,0.02129927277565,-0.9574026211515791,Negative
During the fourth quarter net cash used in operating activities and for the purchase of fixed assets was 2.8 million as compared to 5.6 million for the same period of 2019 a reduction of 50 yearoveryear.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the yearended December 31 2020 we recorded a net loss of approximately 19.3 million or a net loss per diluted share of 0.60 compared to 23.1 million or a net loss per diluted share of 0.92 for the same period last year. Net cash used in operating activities and for the purchase of fixed assets during the year ended December 31 2020 totaled 17.1 million as compared to 20.4 million for the same period of 2019.,MOTS,0.0119529068470001,-0.976095364150622,Negative
As reflected in these comparisons of net loss and cash spend activity for 2020 as compared to 2019 the results of our cost cutting measures which we initially put in place at the end of the first quarter have contributed to a significantly extended cash runway.,MOTS,0.0818771421909332,-0.8362468101065219,Negative
At December 31 2020 we reported 20.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. This included the 8 million from our 2019 term along with Silicon Valley Bank. In January 2021 we further strengthened our cash position through the execution of a warrant exchange agreement with an existing institutional investors which raised net proceeds of approximately 11 million.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We believe that with this bolstered balance sheet we are poised to execute on our upcoming value creation drivers laid out for 2021 to ensure compliance with our Silicon Valley Bank liquidity covenant with the first quarter of next year and meet our overall anticipated cash needs further into 2022.,MOTS,0.937325954437256,0.8746518341611829,Positive
And with that Ill now turn the call back over to Tim.,MOTS,0.1062861680984497,-0.7874287291936453,Negative
Thank you Andrew and let me summarize the key takeaways from todays call. We are pursuing a global market opportunity for our PureVu Technology and believe we currently have no direct competition. While this leaves us with the challenges of being a first mover and changing physician behavior we continue to make steady progress in creating market awareness and adding new hospitals and physicians.,MOTS,0.945486068725586,0.8909720724654633,Positive
As COVID19 hospitalizations decline we believe we will be operating in a more normalized environment which will improve procedure access for our sales team and enable more opportunities to drive utilization which will lead to increased demand for the PureVu system.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Finally we are excited about the four value creation drivers I discussed in my earlier remarks including reimbursement product innovation clinical data and strategic partnerships. Each of these catalyst offer important opportunities for us to enhance our portfolio broaden our addressable market and unlock value for our customers their patients and our shareholders.,MOTS,0.9999371767044068,0.9998743533339225,Positive
I will now ask the operator to open the call for your questions.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
QuestionandAnswer Session,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. Operator Instructions. Our first question comes from Matt OBrien with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.,MOTS,0.9885426759719848,0.9770853382857667,Positive
Hi guys This is Drew on for Matt. Thank you for taking the questions. I just want to start on the sleeve minimum agreement. You know maybe you could share a little bit more detail on how those are structured. You know how many sleeves do you expect those two centers to order and  or I guess how many do they have to order to reach those requirement. And then you know how should we be thinking about that from maybe a revenue or quarterly cadence perspective.,MOTS,0.9546447992324828,0.9092895443973208,Positive
Yeah Drew thanks for your question thanks for joining today. So first of all were really excited to be able to ink these first initial committed agreements and as I mentioned you know in my prepared remarks the capital environment very difficult right and at the end of the day our conviction is all around driving this procedure getting physicians trained and getting them comfortable using the device and really improving patient care. So this is a way to get the product in when they dont have the capital budget but also gives us a commitment back pretty much more predictable volumes at least initially.,MOTS,0.9997116923332214,0.9994233843227531,Positive
While were not going to give out specific you know contractual details that we have with these customers what I can tell you generally is weve talked before about you know first year utilization we feel is typically going to be in the seven to ten procedures a month and these agreements are written to fully cover that and we expect them actually to grow much larger than that because in most of these situations we have just a small number of the physicians who are actually doing the procedure.,MOTS,0.0070943534374237,-0.9858124767616253,Negative
So hopefully that gives you a little bit of feel. You can kind of model that out but thats the way theyre structure today. And you know what wed likely expect over time is that their capital budgets free up. I would think that most of these customers would end up then you know moving to either an outright purchase of the capital or you know lease agreement. But right now this is a great way to get them up and running with the product.,MOTS,0.9992398023605348,0.9984796038148429,Positive
Okay that thats inaudible and congrats on a couple of new product evaluations. Can you just remind us of how you know some of those processes are structured I guess especially during COVID here. I mean whats the requirement from training whats the requirement from you know as far as having a sales person on the ground or anything like that. And then you know how long does it typically take with some of those account. I mean obviously weve talked about NYU in the past before you start seeing meaningful utilization of PureVu.,MOTS,0.9766750931739808,0.9533501585424893,Positive
Yeah you know its been an interesting year right thats an understatement. So there is probably not a one size fits all answer in terms of the approach that each of these sites have asked us to kind of work within as it relates to you know the impact of COVID on their staff and you know protocols and things like that. But typically the structure that we believe optimizes our successes.,MOTS,0.9937255382537842,0.9874510690278226,Positive
You know if we can be there onsite and do initial training for the entire staff that will be associated with the product as well as of course the physicians you know and have kind of a kick off meeting if you will and then everyones on the same page as it relates to what the technology does what the benefit is. We make sure that we coordinate with the nursing floors right.,MOTS,0.9945353269577026,0.9890706474010036,Positive
So if you got these patients that are up on the floor waiting to have a colonoscopy done they fully understand they are educated that now theres a solution down in GI that allowed them to do the procedure despite the patient being ready. So there is a lot of coordination that needs to be done.,MOTS,0.8214558362960815,0.6429114597508072,Positive
So in an ideal situation we are there onsite initially doing all of that organizational work if you will. And that has continued in several sites. As a matter of fact our evaluation in Boston that we just did here at the end of the year and into the first quarter we were able to be onsite despite what was happening with COVID. Their protocols allowed for that so we can follow that very approach and we had a rep and you know clinical training folks on site.,MOTS,0.9976568818092346,0.9953137608252531,Positive
But in some of the other accountant and its been a little bit of an elongated process throughout this year weve not been able to be there. So we had to use remote tools and we talked about this before in the past but we  you know we really digitized all of our materials so now were able to do things very effectively over the phone via Zoom you know theres chapter narrated video that our staff has in front of them so they can see exactly how the system set up and you know its worked its worked out well. It just takes a little bit longer to try to manage it that way.,MOTS,0.9999380111694336,0.9998760222649707,Positive
So the sales process you know I would say has been taking probably upwards of you know six months plus given some of those hurdles and in the back end the value analysis committees have been on and off meeting its been kind of stop and go. So I would say this is a very unusual last 12 months as it relates to the typical time that it would take to get these deals done.,MOTS,0.7752402424812317,0.5504802170277936,Positive
Yeah that makes perfect sense. Just last one from me the Upper GI indication. Maybe if you could just layout the value prop there How similar or different is that to your current PureVu market and then how should we think about that indication as far as impact your business and maybe 2022 maybe. Thank you.,MOTS,0.9999985098838806,0.9999970197659849,Positive
Yeah were really excited about this and as I mentioned earlier the team our internal team has done a terrific job from an RD and engineering perspective to continue to hit all of our milestones on the project. So were on track with getting ready for submission to the FDA well have a product on the market this year.,MOTS,0.9998608827590942,0.9997217653523478,Positive
The way were positioning this not dissimilar to the Lower GI but obviously this is utilized for bleeding typically for bleeding in the Upper GI tract and what weve heard really time and time again from our customers very important influential customers theyre doing these types of procedures on a daily basis is that the struggle with blood and adherent blood clots that can form in the stomach and the duodenum and you know visualization becomes a problem.,MOTS,0.0220792889595031,-0.9558425878540207,Negative
So it parallels the Lower GIs. At the end of the day its all about visualization so you can see what you need to then treat. So we will have the product on the market. Our initial plan is to do a very targeted  I would call it a kind of a soft launch as soon as we get it out there. We will have those accounts lined up well have the physicians lined up and will get you know feedback from the market initially and then we would move into you know a broader launch but were very excited about that.,MOTS,0.9999932050704956,0.999986410132891,Positive
Were not going to comment on specific revenue projections at this point but what I will say is there are approximately 400000 of these procedures a year done in the U.S. primarily all in hospitals so it adds  you know call it roughly another 25 to our kind of total addressable opportunity that were focused on today in the hospital environment and their synergy because youre talking about you know same hospitals same physicians and we think that this is going to be a really nice addon to the portfolio.,MOTS,0.0667254626750946,-0.8665501872004194,Negative
Thank you.,MOTS,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thanks Drew.,MOTS,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Bauser with Colliers Securities. Please proceed with your question.,MOTS,0.9858688712120056,0.971737725578383,Positive
Great Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for all the updates today. Sorry if I missed this but can we walk through the upcoming clinical trial cadence and data read out timings. I know you just started the pilot study at the Cleveland Clinic which is great. I just want to make sure I understand how things will shape out this year from a catalyst perspective.,MOTS,0.999325156211853,0.9986503116192291,Positive
A  Tim Moran,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah sure Kyle and thanks for joining. You know were really excited about this new trial that we just enrolled the first patient. Im going to pass it over to Mark and have him outlined kind of the overall clinical view if you will mark,MOTS,0.9998210668563844,0.9996421334994636,Positive
Great,MOTS,0.969902276992798,0.9398045181062928,Positive
Thanks Tim. Hey Kyle,MOTS,0.9872719049453736,0.9745437947176665,Positive
Hey Mark,MOTS,0.8045236468315125,0.609047060636914,Positive
Yeah so as Tim mentioned were really excited about the study in the Cleveland Clinic and its really doing something thats you know fairly unheard of with doing colonoscopy with basically you know purgativebased preps so these significant leaders that you know time is of the essence to get in their to find the source of a bleed and thus creating the spaces if possible. You know were looking at getting in these patients with no standard purgative. Just a couple of tap water anomalies and they are going in with PureVu to cleanse the colon to find the source of the bleed.,MOTS,0.8328590989112854,0.6657179985749713,Positive
We anticipate being able to enroll in this study and complete enrollment later this year and the reality is probably the actual read out of the data you know will be in early 22 as far as you know any publications etcetera happening from it. But again its a really unique trial of  were going forward in these critical patients where there was no crafting being able to get in there quickly especially these folks who are in the ICU if we can you know not only help to get them out of the hospital quicker but certainly just downgrading them into a regular board can be incredibly significant for the treatment of patients and the cost of hospital.,MOTS,0.9788104295730592,0.9576208338861669,Positive
Okay got it. And might we see any other kind of cuts at the previous data thats already being collected from you know a reduced or expedite maybe therell be some data read outs at D.W. anything else out there we should keep an eye on,MOTS,0.974913775920868,0.9498275219366088,Positive
Yeah so we do anticipate in the coming months some additional data read out from some of our prior trials you know and were always looking to it to continuing to push and publish you know some interesting case studies that were seeing as well that sort of help this team was talking about. You know adding fuel to the fire for the protocol adoptions for folks as they look at the various patient population so we can also augment our data with some of the interesting case studies that are happening as well.,MOTS,0.1472287774085998,-0.7055434617659222,Negative
Sure okay got it. And lastly if I may can you talk a little bit about the recent updates to the GEN2 systems so  I know that they are the latest enhancements are now cleared in Europe and the U.S. and I think it has to do with ergonomics and software but I guess just any other color there would be appreciated.,MOTS,0.9927241802215576,0.9854483517696571,Positive
Yeah great. Mark if you can take this one as well please.,MOTS,0.9661810398101808,0.9323620393049954,Positive
Sure so yeah its a great question Kyle. So were actually excited a lot of these things just rolled out toward the end of last year with some of the upgrade. You know probably the most impactful one was even though our GEN2 already significant will streamline the loading we made some enhancements that made that even quicker and easier for the techs to do so continuing to drive that.,MOTS,0.9997844696044922,0.9995689389520519,Positive
Also helping with removal of the scope post procedure some enhancements to make that simpler as well and then added some things to that streamline the software and position some more flexibility as they are looking after using different modes in the system and how to work through that in a little bit easier and more streamlined fashion just to accelerate the procedure time as well.,MOTS,0.998137354850769,0.9962747074810907,Positive
Great No thats helpful and thanks for all the updates. That it for me.,MOTS,0.999296009540558,0.9985920182418935,Positive
Okay thanks Kyle.,MOTS,0.952178955078125,0.9043578531490881,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.,MOTS,0.980139970779419,0.9602799178838239,Positive
Hey guys thanks for taking the question. This is David on for Steve. Just going back to the COVID dynamics in the quarter and early on here and heading towards the end of the first quarter any additional color you could talk about in terms of the impact on inaudible and youre sales reps ability to get active decisions and are you able to talk about anything on how the inpatient colonoscopy volumes have trended better to preCOVID levels Thanks.,MOTS,0.9997340440750122,0.99946808783298,Positive
A  Tim Moran,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah sure David thanks and thanks for joining. So its been interesting. You know Q3 was definitely a marked point where we saw a procedure volume come back to  you know I think in Q3 I talked about  you know call it 80 to 85 of prepandemic levels kind of was the feel we had from speaking to our customers and you know that really for the most part continued into Q4 and you know I think thats what  you know if we look at Q1 it feels about the same. So I wouldnt say that weve seen a significant improvement but there hasnt been a terrible decline either.,MOTS,0.9793095588684082,0.9586190930718739,Positive
I think in the back half of Q4 in NovemberDecember we talked earlier about how things flattened out a little bit. It was very specific to geographies. You know California where we have several installations Texas where we have several installations that were just getting hit hard you know it impacted procedure volumes.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I think Q1 is probably looking similar to what we saw in Q3 and Q4 but we are optimistic now as I think everyone is you know with the roll out and really an acceleration of the rollout of the vaccinations that you know we are expecting to see improvement in Q2 and you know in talking to physicians in our key hospitals theyve kind of echoed that so.,MOTS,0.9962576627731324,0.9925153210850486,Positive
You know were bullish on what we would expect to see procedurally in Q2 plus with access right because right now we probably have access to you know about  you know real access to about 40 to 50 of our account. What I mean by that is we can go in you know without a lot of trouble and be there and be in procedures but the others have a lot of protocols in place that make it very very difficult to be there and to get into different units and we still have certain types that we cant get in at all. So again were hopeful that as we get into Q2 thatll start to improve.,MOTS,0.0043734908103942,-0.9912542052592073,Negative
Okay great thats really helpful. And then I was wondering if you could talk about some of the recent progress with your collaborations and what youve been doing How has that been doing And have you seen that trend over time toward that 50 of the inpatient requirement colonoscopy patients that are poorly prepped. Is it trending towards that direction,MOTS,0.9909976720809937,0.9819953334303697,Positive
A  Tim Moran,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah so were very pleased with that relationship. You know obviously we have another update today that they are now also you know signed to a committed volume agreement. The physicians that we work with there are terrific and have really embraced PureVu so I would say generally speaking its going very well. And yes its going to take time to get to that full penetration point but I think were seeing  even if you look in this past quarter were seeing consistent reordering were seeing them gain a significant degree of independence.,MOTS,0.9999394416809082,0.9998788832896253,Positive
So what I mean by that is they are doing procedures when were not there which is the goal right and theyre getting  you know that just shows the comfort level that they have and you know were talking to them about some other ways to collaborate over time here. So I think well see them as a very important customer for us moving forward.,MOTS,0.9620224237442015,0.9240448022155772,Positive
The other thing thats unique if you will about NYU and I think weve talked about this a little bit is the way they are structured from a physicians perspective is they have a director of inpatient services GI Hospital if you will that is on site on a consistent basis right. So other facilities will have physicians that are on rotation and if its a large GI group they might have you know physicians that you know are there doing inpatient rotation once a month or even a longer space between whereas at NYU you have key physicians that are there each week and their full objective is to work on these inpatients.,MOTS,0.0252121686935424,-0.9495768246512561,Negative
So obviously thats a captive audience for us and you know its a learning that we took over the course of last year that as we expand our targets focusing on some of these accounts that are structured that way can really optimize success and really accelerated success because youre talking about you know a lot fewer physicians that we need to get up and running to try to get to you know that standard of care level if you will.,MOTS,0.9984917640686036,0.9969835263392488,Positive
So thats been done something that you know weve learned from NYU and we are now replicating in other places and NYU has been helpful in terms of getting us networked to colleagues in other sites across the country that are structured similarly.,MOTS,0.828758180141449,0.6575161561466194,Positive
Okay great. And just lastly from me any ideas on timing for a publication for the expedite trial,MOTS,0.9117596745491028,0.8235192439074779,Positive
Ill have Mark answer that. I think just generally speaking though that were expecting something here call it in the next two to three months but mark if you can just confirm.,MOTS,0.8887525796890259,0.7775050267607133,Positive
Yeah thats correct. You know we are expecting hopefully something in the next few months on the expedite study. Again that was an investigator initiated study by Doctor Jacobson who actually transitioned middle of last year from The Boston Medical Center NGA so thats kind of slowed down some of the progress on that and moving that forward. So obviously thats driving that data and that publication so hopeful that that will happen in the next few months as well.,MOTS,0.9560559988021852,0.9121119452190074,Positive
Okay great thank you.,MOTS,0.9839369058609008,0.9678737925730898,Positive
Thank you.,MOTS,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Haynor with Alliance Global. Please proceed with your question.,MOTS,0.9858688712120056,0.971737725578383,Positive
Good afternoon gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you hear me okay,MOTS,0.9972962141036988,0.9945924249842317,Positive
Yes we can Ben loud and clear.,MOTS,0.9557722806930542,0.9115445086625269,Positive
Excellent So just curious on any more color you can provide on the ICD10 code presentation. Do you have any sense of how that went You know just kind of looking at the options that are available to the agency. It looks like other than the one thats you know kind of the NTAP supportive one it almost seems like a decoy option and it only adds intra procedure to the existing coding. I mean what are kind of the thoughts around that,MOTS,0.9486886262893676,0.8973771914107747,Positive
Yeah so why dont I start and if we want to get into more granular detail Ben I can pass it to Mark. But so we did participate in that meeting. I think we did it nice job and represented what were looking to try to do with PureVu. We did get the recommendation from CMS so they put forth  theres various options that they can choose from.,MOTS,0.9989696741104126,0.9979393469925804,Positive
They put forth a recommendation before it goes out and they are suggesting and recommending that PureVu receive an ICD10 code. So thats positive right and now whats happening is as we mentioned it will go to an open comment period where folks can weigh in on any feedback they have on that and then it will come back inhouse and theyll ultimately make the final decision later this year.,MOTS,0.9998438358306884,0.9996876714752145,Positive
But you know thats an important part of the process if you will as we as move towards the NTAP right which would actually provide the coverage. So the ICD10 as you know is a way to track the procedure. So its important that you kind of get through that initial hurdle and I think we feel like we represented ourselves well in that process. Did that answer your questions Ben,MOTS,0.7828134298324585,0.5656266007581954,Positive
Yeah I mean thats what I was looking for and then you know kind of on the open comment period you wouldnt seem to  you wouldnt expect that you know anyone would be highly motivated to come out against you guys given there is no competition.,MOTS,0.9336775541305542,0.8673550291985448,Positive
Yeah we would not expect that but obviously they do have to go through their process right and you know well see where that ends up but no we wouldnt expect that.,MOTS,0.2470161318778991,-0.5059686338714564,Negative
Okay. Thats helpful. Mark did you have anything to add,MOTS,0.9886170029640198,0.9772339923584417,Positive
No nothing.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Steal your thunder or anything.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
No youve covered it well and you know were optimistic about getting the code but you know well have to see how things move along with that  in a inaudible point the likelihood that somebody would come along and make any comment to the negative use it was pretty small.,MOTS,0.978933811187744,0.9578675972626192,Positive
Sure. Cross Talk,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
You know the way we are looking at this you know from a reimbursement perspective you know Im pleased with the progress that were making and the teams making. You know the NTAP submission is you know one of the various programs to obtain reimbursement this being for a new technology and you know that one being specific to inpatient and you know we view that  we dont have currently headwinds for inpatient from a reimbursement perspective. However you know we do see that as an accelerator potential accelerator you know if we were to be awarded that additional coverage you know that could help particularly with the value analysis committee the financial end of that process.,MOTS,0.9216213822364808,0.8432426710383125,Positive
It becomes a lot easier.,MOTS,0.9050785303115844,0.8101569474678916,Positive
Yeah.,MOTS,0.2519094944000244,-0.49618190299385967,Negative
Got it And then on the Cleveland Clinic study with the double anemia protocol 20 patients so I mean thats a kind of a pilot study. How come you think itll take so long to enroll,MOTS,0.0236892402172088,-0.9526226834193967,Negative
So Ben what Ill say is we are just not going to put up a hard date on it only because its an Investigator Initiative Study so we dont fully control that. But you know I think you know given the size of the institution and the number of patients that we you know outlined here it certainly has the potential to move relatively quickly. But at this point until we have better line of sight which I think we will. By next quarter well know how many weve done and what the pace looks like we can provide a probably a more specific targeted date but for now we wanted to keep it general.,MOTS,0.9999996423721312,0.9999992847438361,Positive
Okay thats fare. And then finally on the minimum sleeve purchase commitments you know I know some of these are obviously larger institutions more than one location. You know as you start out you have kind of seven to 10 procedures a month and that you are doing at maybe at the main location. What happens when they say this is great lets expand these protocols system wide We want more of these How do you handle that I mean is it kind of that seven to 10 procedures per hospital or youd do it on a bigger basis or how would you think about structuring that down the road should things go well,MOTS,0.9997286796569824,0.9994573589905256,Positive
Yeah so its a great question. So one that was one the reasons why weve decided to make these 12 month agreements right. So theyre not three years or something because things will change and I think as the new technology in the market you know as were out there you know as they said earlier really our biggest objective right and challenge is change in behavior right. So were asking physicians and staff to do something differently than theyve done in the past right any type of new technology.,MOTS,0.9999701976776124,0.9999403953196977,Positive
So getting the product in the door and having them have access to it you know were comfortable with the minimums that we put into this first 12 months based on you know as I said a small number of positions utilizing it because we believe that as you have it on site you know its our job to be on site training additional physicians and they will immediately as they start to do cases for the first time they will see the value right.,MOTS,0.9742956161499025,0.9485912016577733,Positive
So I think the minimums that are put into these agreements from our perspective you know will get outdated pretty quickly. You know if we can get this in the hands of additional physicians and at the end of the 12 month period you know well look at what that next agreement might look like.,MOTS,0.987485647201538,0.974971279484796,Positive
I could see in the future potentially having options where its you know its either just an outright purchase or lease or you know rental or we might have different minimum requirements 12 months from now. But we wrote them as 12 month agreement so we have flexibility.,MOTS,0.9780884981155396,0.9561769701105178,Positive
Okay that makes a lot of sense. Thanks all I had gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions.,MOTS,0.9933507442474364,0.9867014805683376,Positive
Thank you Ben.,MOTS,0.9314355850219728,0.8628710883087449,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.,MOTS,0.9858688712120056,0.971737725578383,Positive
Hi This is Destiny on for Jeff. Thank you for taking my questions. I hope you are all well. I guess Id like to start with revenue. I saw in some of your commentary that you mentioned a portion was from new accounts and a portion was from existing accounts. Im wondering if you could help us understand what this proportion look like even just at a high level does have to be specific but perhaps a range,MOTS,0.9999440908432008,0.9998881816197527,Positive
Yeah sure Destiny. Thanks for joining. Yes so we definitely dont want to you know start to break it out to that level of detail but I would say that a large portion of the early revenues that were seeing here are coming from existing repeat orders. So what that will look like is in any given quarter the majority of the revenue is coming from repeat orders and then youre going to potentially get a couple initial orders to get going and I think that happened here in the last quarter. So we had an account that you know switched and got the approval right at the end of the quarter and placed their first paid purchase but thats obviously a small majority of the revenue that were seeing right now.,MOTS,0.9999312162399292,0.9998624323978618,Positive
Right in with some of these well these two contracts that could change maybe just slightly but nothing  it will still look pretty similar to how to fend for the last two three quarters you say,MOTS,0.9739366769790648,0.947873322888209,Positive
In terms of the amount or the break out between new and an existing.,MOTS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The breakout yeah the breakout.,MOTS,0.2443224787712097,-0.5113559432959219,Negative
Well you know I do think that that will start to pick up because we have several of these types of agreements that are pending you know that weve been actively working really into the end of Q4 as it got delayed with some of the COVID19 issue and here in Q1. So just depending on when they make the commitment and place their first order that amount could certainly change.,MOTS,0.9810526371002196,0.962105251613409,Positive
And you know I think as procedure volume comes back just kind of going back to what I was saying earlier you know we expect many of these existing sites that have been evaluating and have had elongated valuations to get fully converted and start purchasing. So yeah I think that that certainly will start to rampup in terms of new purchases coming in as opposed to the repeat orders that were getting from our earliest sites right now.,MOTS,0.9880282878875732,0.9760565615037451,Positive
Okay got it. And could you just remind us of your efforts OUS is there anything going on even you know RD that we should be aware of,MOTS,0.9258886575698853,0.8517772267921131,Positive
So yeah so if we think about OUS weve had to have several activities. We talk about some of the regulatory you know the updated CE mark which is obviously important. We have done I would say a high level exploration and diligence into Europe and into Asia as it relates to the opportunity for PureVu and weve had inbound request from several different entities interested in either selling or you know having access to PureVu in their market so were evaluating those.,MOTS,0.9870032668113708,0.9740065181294191,Positive
I think right now our focus is very much as you know on the U.S. So to access Europe or to access China or Japan you know obviously we would be most interested in doing that with a partner and as I said earlier you know we had significant dialogue with a variety of different entities both large kind of manufacturers medical device companies as well as key distributors in certain regions around the world. So we continue to evaluate have discussions kind of do our diligence.,MOTS,0.9721757173538208,0.9443514015384922,Positive
So were laying the foundation for an eventual entrance into those markets but right now you know given COVID and you know balancing our cash burn the focus is obviously heavily on the U.S.,MOTS,0.1224371790885925,-0.7551266879598427,Negative

Hi This is Boobalan dialing in for Yi Chen. Just a followup ICD10 reimbursements how do you think this quote up on approval will affect your companys top and bottom line Can you quantify or if it cant be quantified now when would that be possible,MOTS,0.9915008544921876,0.9830016988525982,Positive
Thanks Boobalan for joining in and thanks for your question. So I would just say generally you know the way  right now we dont have you know line of sight into what the potential reimbursement amount may be right so we cant comment on that.,MOTS,0.9993797540664672,0.9987595073935431,Positive
But I think generally what were seeing it as  strategically if you think about the NTAP it would be an accelerator right to adoption. Because if you had some additional reimbursement on the PureVu sleeve in the hospital environment I think it would allow us to work through the value analysis committee financial analysis much easier you know because its reducing obviously the overall cost burden.,MOTS,0.9229363203048706,0.8458725487426213,Positive
But keep in mind that today on an individual patient basis individual procedure were showing a return on the investment you know with one sleeve. So this would just you know as I said serve as more of an accelerator if you will. So I dont see it having any anything but positive upside to you know revenue uptake and obviously we wouldnt change our pricing based on that either.,MOTS,0.9798654913902284,0.9597309587782379,Positive
Thats helpful. And where do you stand on the REDUCE study and do you plan to initiate any new clinical studies for this year,MOTS,0.9815253019332886,0.9630505818430077,Positive
So I can ask Mark to talk about  you know we actually do have another study that were going to initiate in Europe. So Mark do you want to just provide just a quick overview there,MOTS,0.9371414184570312,0.8742827619807494,Positive
Sure actually just to comment. I mean you mentioned the REDUCE study which was going to be an open label registry which we did back when we did our cost cutting last year. We did put that study in the back burner and so right now were focused on the Cleveland Clinic study that we talked about earlier and those patients in the ICU.,MOTS,0.9768291711807252,0.9536583147396536,Positive
And then we are initiating a small study also in Europe and were going to see some of the key thought leaders there and that study is really focused on patients that have  its called a difficulty in prepping in the outpatient scenario and are typically coming back almost on a yearly basis because they never got a good example. The physician that are examining them constantly just to make sure that whatever calls they missed on the prior procedure hopefully as they get larger they will catch them before they become cancerous problems. So we will be initiating that study coming up in the next quarter or so as well.,MOTS,6.914138793945312e-05,-0.9998629092353042,Negative
So again itll be an interesting population because that will also feed into some of the issues in the outpatient in the U.S. for these patient that are on a reduced surveillance interval because they dont get a good preparation and theres concern of an inevitable cancer. So its a nice way for us to get some early data on that as well as see some of the key thought leaders in Europe as well.,MOTS,0.0063052177429199,-0.9873907490913565,Negative
Great One final from me so how many hospital allocations are currently underway and how many new ones do you anticipate to start within 2021 Thank you.,MOTS,0.9871455430984496,0.9742910708731833,Positive
Yeah sure you know listen we have the system safe in more than 20 sites. I would say Boobalan right now if we kind of think about COVID and access there is about  Ill call it about twothirds of those that are active. We expect the others to kind of pick back up.,MOTS,0.8554378747940063,0.7108755772564275,Positive
We are working with as I said earlier a very lean commercial team. So we are remaining very focused on targets that have the highest potential to close. The most quickly and also kind of play a strategic role in the overall foundation setting that we are doing and I would say thats the mode that we are in here as you know. And I think had we not lost a handful of quarters with COVID we would have probably been you know through that and further along.,MOTS,0.9970327615737916,0.9940655196103574,Positive
But well continue to strategically add new sites I would say each and every quarter as we just did as we reported in Q4 and were continuing here in Q1 but were going to do it smart. And as we as we look at 2021 we will also think about where well expand the commercial organization in targeted geographies that we believe the ROI will be there and that will allow it to accelerate bringing on additional sites as well. So thats just the way were thinking about it right now.,MOTS,0.9997396469116212,0.9994792935128771,Positive
All right thats it from me. Thanks for your time and congrats on your progress.,MOTS,0.9959072470664978,0.991814489254051,Positive
Thank you very much.,MOTS,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.,MOTS,0.9603155851364136,0.9206311229652899,Positive

On todays call Ill share with you highlights on Weibos user product and monetization review the progress made in 2020 and elaborate our strategies for 2021.,WB,0.9875972270965576,0.9751944394078489,Positive
Foreign Language Let me start with our fourth quarter financial results. In the fourth quarter our total revenue increased 10 to 513.4 million mainly attributable to less impact from COVID19 pandemic to the advertising business as well as our efforts to optimize the competitive strategy for brand and performance ad business.,WB,0.9426062107086182,0.885212352998467,Positive
Advertising and marketing revenue reached 453.5 million an increase of 12 yearoveryear with 91 of ad revenue coming from mobile. In the fourth quarter nonGAAP operating income reached 204.1 million an increase of 12 to 21 yearoveryear representing a nonGAAP operating margin of 40.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Foreign Language For full year 2020 Weibos total revenues reached 1.69 billion a decrease of 4 yearoveryear. Advertising and marketing revenues were 1.49 billion a decrease of 3 yearoveryear. NonGAAP operating income reached 579.6 million representing a nonGAAP operating margin of 34.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Foreign Language On the user front Weibos MAU reached 521 million. And average DAU reached to 235 million in December 2020. 94 of Weibos MAU came from mobile.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Foreign Language As we review 2020 we faced two major challenges. First on the user front although the pandemic in the first half of the year brought us large scale users to consume pandemicrelated needs and hot trends it had a negative impact on the content generation of entertainment vertical and certain other areas such as tourism and sports which resulted in less user engagement in this sector.,WB,0.0234378278255462,-0.9531255085024289,Negative
With progress made on the pandemic control we adjusted our strategy accordingly in the second half of this year putting more emphasis on our core competence in hot trends social functions and video. So far we have seen an uptick of our overall traffic in the first quarter compared to last the December.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Foreign Language Second on monetization. The pandemic has hit some sector of our business hard early last year. However with a wellcontrolled pandemic situation and the recovery of the ad demand Weibos social marketing value proposition earned wider recognition among brand customers leveraging our unique marketing offerings such as hot trends celebrity and KOL marketing as well as brand price performance solution. As a result our brand ad revenues delivered a solid rebound in the second half of this year and achieved doubledigit growth yearoveryear in Q4 with number of branding customers spending with us setting a new record.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For performance ad business despite certain pressure from advertising and market competition the decrease of our performance ad revenue in Q4 further narrowed compared with prior quarters mainly thanks to the fully upgraded ad bidding system super FST and continued robust growth in gaming and education sectors under the brand plus performance model.,WB,0.9746122360229492,0.9492244417813074,Positive
Next let me share some color on our progress in product and monetization in Q4 as well as layout key initiatives for 2021. On the product front starting from Q4 last year we further enhanced Weibos differentiated competitiveness in hot trend and social attributes. Coupled with efficient channel strategies we stabilized our user scale and further drove user engagement. Concurrently we also beefed up our investment in the video sector to strengthen users mind set of using Weibo for video consumption so as to enhance our competitiveness in user acquisition.,WB,0.994735836982727,0.989471667690079,Positive
On the channel front in Q4 we optimized channel strategy for new and recalled users combined with hot trend and topic products. When hot events occur we will encourage media accounts and KOLs to discuss around topics through product and operating mechanism providing realtime topicrelated content to users. With the optimized strategies to further enhance the platforms confidence in this recall and retention through hot trends bringing our strength in content offering into supply. Taking the New Years Eve as example remember our New Years Eve relating toward the pass 120 million up 77 compared with last year and recalled more than 60 million users back to our platform.,WB,0.9999772310256958,0.9999544620242489,Positive
On the social front for these users recalled through hot events or channel investment we focus on improving their consumption depth and user frequency in the relationshipbased feeds. To elaborate we focus on improving user experience in relationshipbased feeds to data mining and quality social content based on several dimensions such as intimacy of social relations frequency of visits and amount of discussion by followers et cetera. With such quality content offer we could further deepen their consumption as well as enhance user retention.,WB,0.9983326196670532,0.9966652373464331,Positive
Additionally we focused on enhancing diversity of content distribution in the information feeds in order to drive user stickiness interaction and consumption. For instance in the fourth quarter we extended realtime consumption of video content through this simultaneous distribution in our core feeds. As a result the effective time spend per user on a post really recommendation feed increased over 30 and the effect of video views posted each recommendation increased over 10 compared with Q3.,WB,0.9781873226165771,0.956374619230401,Positive
On the video front in 2020 we reinforced our product offerings and operation mechanism and attracted a great number of quality video content creators to Weibo. In the second half of 2020 we launched the video account program to incentivize Weibos top content creators to shift toward video content generation so as to encourage more video production and consumption. We saw a significant uplift in the number of video accounts. Currently the number of registered video accounts has surpassed a million among which over 15000 video accounts already have more than 1 million followers per each.,WB,0.9686069488525392,0.9372138602816229,Positive
By verticals there is a good proportion of video produced by top content creators in the media and variety show verticals but we still need to increase that to many other sections on the platform. This year we will continue to improve the overall experience for video accounts scaleup video content generation among top content creators as well as strengthen the effective distribution of video content in feeds and video community so as to boost the video content consumption and improve the platforms overall video content ecosystem.,WB,0.9846975803375244,0.9693951424331322,Positive
Foreign Language,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Let me briefly layout our strategies for 2021 on the product and operation front. We seek to extend user base and engagement from the following three aspects. First on the channel investment leveraging our competitive advantage in these acquisition costs will ensure channel investments through traditional channels and focus more on channel investment to improve user engagement while strengthening the synergy between channel investments and subsequent content consumption and thereby increasing user engagement and retention.,WB,0.999060332775116,0.9981206644300606,Positive
Second on core competence we will continue to solidify Weibos competitive mode as a leading social media platform. From product perspective we will improve core features of hot trend and social interactions and improve user stickiness and interaction among users core user groups.,WB,0.9997936487197876,0.9995872971935851,Positive
On accounting system side we will step up our efforts to empower top content creators to monetize within our ecosystem which will in turn stimulate their content generation and interaction with fans driving Weibos user engagement.,WB,0.9746666550636292,0.9493332799275398,Positive
Finally on video content through video accounts we will accelerate the transformation of Weibos key content creator group toward video creation and promote the supply and consumption of Weibos video contents. And meanwhile we are focused on content operation on key verticals such as TV series variety show and gaming verticals to cultivate users consumption behavior through our differentiated video content offerings and further strengthen users loyalty to the platform through videos.,WB,0.9997128248214722,0.9994256493006046,Positive
Foreign Language On the monetization front our KA ad revenues in Q4 increased 18 yearoveryear. The rapid recovery of KA business in the second half of the year were mainly driven by the following factors first of all from the perspective of the market environment most industry sectors have returned to normal operation in the second half of the year and gradually resumed ad replacement except for few sectors such as entertainment tourism. That has not fully recovered from the pandemic. And meanwhile the pandemic has further driven ad budget shift from offline to online. We saw top brand customers and also those emerging brands embracing Internet platforms as their major campaign arena.,WB,0.8530318140983582,0.7060634529968817,Positive
Secondly KA clients have shifted more of their budget from TV and longform video platform to social and shortvideo platform and lowering the user engagement shift. With this trend social platform had more strength in KA marketing.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Finally in KA advertising Weibo highlights its marketing strategies on KOL content IP and brand plus performance offering leveraging its robust content ecosystem. But one thing we facilitate better content marketing for top KA clients. For another we lower ad placement barriers for brand customers especially midtier customers through brand price performance ad offerings and thus deliver better ad efficiency.,WB,0.9881272315979004,0.9762544490423495,Positive
For example throughout 2020 we had nearly a 1000 content marketing projects leveraging 100s of celebrities 1000s of KOLs and more than 30000 KOCs to participate in brand contentbased campaigns achieving way better results than pure branding campaigns.,WB,0.9985159635543824,0.9970319253396545,Positive
Foreign Language Moving on to SMEs. In 2020 we continue to see intense competition in the performance ad market. That said our SME and revenues decreased 5 yearoveryear in the fourth quarter improving from last quarter in terms of ad new trends. Let me briefly recap our progress made in our performance ad sector in the year of 2020.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Foreign Language On the ad product front first we focus on enhancing the overall efficiency of our realtime bidding system namely super FST and further optimizing its algorithm.,WB,0.8104691505432129,0.6209380751479121,Positive
Second we launched several advertising tools such as WeiboEvents and ad solution which enables marketing content posted by celebrity and KOLs to reach a more accurate target group instantly. Leveraging the influence of celebrities and KOLs we can maximize the campaign effect while reducing customer cost at the same time.,WB,0.9984020590782166,0.996804116251538,Positive
On the sales operation front first we optimized the SME sales model for key industries to directly serve more clients so that we could respond to and fulfill clients needs more efficiently. Secondly we further led agency to improve their service capabilities and transform into service providers. Third we offer industry specific ad solutions to improve ad performance for different industries leveraging our operational capability around topic and events.,WB,0.8421260118484497,0.6842518354963276,Positive
With the implementation of these above mentioned strategies we saw robust growth in gaming and education sector this year maintaining a tripledigit growth yearoveryear in the fourth quarter.,WB,0.9289640188217164,0.857927952961894,Positive
In the second half of the year we gradually extended such industry specific solutions to Internet service and some offline O2O industries to capture the higher wallet from key industries.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Foreign Language In 2021 we will continue to enhance our monetization skill and efficiency from the following aspects first on ad products based on Weibos unique attributes as a social media platform with younger users we will continue to strengthen the competitiveness of our social ad products and further capture brand plus performance budget and KOL marketing ad dollars to reach more emerging clients as well as obtain incremental budget from middle tier and top clients. Hopefully those client member and ad part could serve as drivers of our growth.,WB,0.9999756813049316,0.9999513625808731,Positive
Second on sales operation we will further develop our industryspecific solutions and support our industrybased sales team to improve organizational efficiency from the aspects of sales policy operational synergy product optimization and service capability et cetera. As such we could improve our wallet share through more diversified drivers from an industry perspective.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Finally on ad technology. Building on the upgraded Super FST we will continue to optimize the ad targeting and the conversion rate of OCPX so as to increase the placement efficiency and ROI clients.,WB,0.9330227375030518,0.8660453951629372,Positive
Coupled with the full funnel ad optimization Weibo is well positioned to improve our ECPM in 2021. And meanwhile we have strengthened our video ad technology and monetization efficiency to gradually unleash the potential of video traffic monetization.,WB,0.8761026859283447,0.7522052241594936,Positive
To sum up in 2021 with more monetizable traffic generated from the growth in user base and engagement we will step up our efforts in ad products sales operation and ad technology to increase Weibos monetization scale efficiency and market competitiveness.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
With that let me turn the call over to Fei Cao for a financial review for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Beside unprecedented challenges from COVID19 and resulted full year singledigit revenue decrease we are pleased with the solid recovery in the second half of 2020 underpinned by the overall ad demand pickup in the domestic market breath of new economy bringing incremental marketing demand as well as our relative ad growth to capture new end markets and additional ad wallet share of existing fans.,WB,0.8493897914886475,0.6987794034358283,Positive

Our KA business booked accelerated yearoveryear growth with the number of brand advertisers spending in ads reaching a new record.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Industrywide the recurring momentum for our KA business continues to be broadbased with key sectors such as FMCG and automobiles closing the year on a higher note. Our belief that entertainment travel and real estate sectors remained pressured as the sporadic COVID19 cases in China in part postponed the recovery pace of new sectors in late 2020.,WB,0.0033215880393981,-0.9933580120551659,Negative
Full year 2020 KA ad revenues reached to 741.7 million an increase of 2 or 9. On that percent including barter impact representing 50 of Weibos total ad revenue.

In 2020 we also notably captured incremental ad wallet through our differentiated KOL marketing tools as well as unique products such as search and targeted products as this resonated well with customers demand.,WB,0.9968448877334596,0.99368977170573,Positive
Looking forward with continuous recovery of ad demand and opportunities brought forth by new economy we continue to see headroom to incenting our customer base as well as potential to tap into incremental ad wallet. We believe we are well positioned to solidify and further uplift our competitiveness in the brand advertising market.,WB,0.9899156093597412,0.9798312066979449,Positive
Turning to SMEs. In the fourth quarter Weibos SME ad revenues was 167.2 million a decrease of 5. We continued to narrow the yearoveryear decline rate leveraging the nice momentum of online sectors particularly gaming education and ecommerce. That said certain offline customers continued to face headwinds particularly amid sporadic outbreak of COVID19 cases in multiple areas in China.,WB,0.8012831211090088,0.6025660053288968,Positive
Fullyear SME ad revenues were 592.7 million a decrease of 16 representing approximately 40 of Weibos total ad revenues mainly due to significant impact from COVID19 especially from offline sector as well as competition headwind.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Although the performance ad market in 2020 was challenging in many ways we made strides in expanding OCPX coverage driving video ad penetration as well as developing integrated industry specific ad solutions which all aim to enhance our ad performance.,WB,0.9911991357803344,0.9823982610692148,Positive
Were delighted to see these initiatives already bear fruit in early stage with the gaming and education sectors booking tripledigit growth this year. The early momentum for these two sectors demonstrated Weibos potential in delivering relatively competitive our ad in the market leveraging our uniqueness in integrating Weibos resources in content KOLs and traffic.,WB,0.985881209373474,0.971762401916028,Positive
Ad revenues from Alibaba in the fourth quarter was 59.5 million an increase of 57 reflecting our cooperation with Alibaba to drive value from both platforms brands and merchants during the peak ecommerce promotional season. Fullyear ad revenues from Alibaba were 152 million an increase of 55.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Apart from the fact that 2019 was relatively low base the momentum of Alibaba ad revenue also reflected our efforts in serving integrated marketing demand for both platforms brands and merchants.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
That said ad spend from Alibaba highly correlated to its own business operations especially its marketing strategies which may change from timetotime. As communicated earlier we cannot assure that such robust growth will be sustainable in the future.,WB,0.74205082654953,0.4841013455994998,Positive
Value added service VAS revenues was 59.9 million in the fourth quarter a decrease of 4. The decrease was primarily resulted from the decrease of live streaming business and was partially offset by the revenue contribution from the interactive entertainment company acquired and consolidated into the company in November 2020. Fullyear 2020 VAS revenues was 203.8 million a decrease of 14 mainly resulting from a decrease in live streaming revenue.,WB,0.1861630380153656,-0.6276748941391075,Negative
Turning to costs and expenses total cost and expenses for fourth quarter was 309.3 million an increase of 3. The increase was primarily due to higher personnelrelated costs and stepup in marketing spend and was partially offset by decreased general and administrative expenses.

Turning to income tax under GAAP measure income tax benefit for fourth quarter was 25.3 million compared to an expense of 31.1 million last year. The income tax benefit was primarily due to the recognition of preferential tax treatment for certain of the companys PRC subsidiaries as well as reverse of recognition of deferred tax liabilities in prior periods related to certain investments.,WB,0.0026758611202239,-0.9946494666632814,Negative
Fullyear income tax expenses was 61.3 million compared to 109.6 million in 2019. The decrease was primarily resulting from changes in deferred tax liabilities related to fair value change on investments.,WB,0.024755984544754,-0.9504891934926472,Negative
Net income attributable to Weibo in fourth quarter was 212.7 million compared to 176.7 million last year. Net margin was 41 compared to 38 same period last year.

Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow items. As of December 31 2020 Weibos cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 1.5 billion compared to 2.4 billion as of December 31 2019. The increase was primarily due to net proceeds from 750 million senior notes issued in July 2020 for general corporate purpose and cash provided by operating activities and was partially offset by the investment activities we made during 2020.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In the fourth quarter cash provided by operating activities was 321.2 million capital expenditures totaled 8.4 million and depreciation and amortization expense amounted to 10.7 million. On fullyear basis cash provided by operating activities was 741.6 million capital expenditures totaled 34.8 million and depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to 32.1 million.

Lastly lets talk about our financial outlook. We anticipate our first quarter of 2021 revenue to increase by 25 to 30 yearoveryear on a constant currency basis. This forecast also reflects Weibos current and preliminary view and is subject to change.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
With that let me now turn the call over to the operator for the QA session.,WB,0.8244450092315674,0.6488898091851527,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions Your first question comes from the line of Tian Hou of TH Capital. Please ask your question.,WB,0.987450122833252,0.9749002307058756,Positive
Foreign Language Gaofei has already elaborated our 2021 strategy can you elaborate a little bit in detail about your outlook in user growth and as well as your channel strategy Thank you.,WB,0.9884873628616332,0.9769747119991252,Positive
Foreign Language So relating to this question before answering the question about 2021 lets talk about the issues that we had in 2020. So for example due to the COVID19 that we really had a historical high or reaching a peak of those number of users in Q1.,WB,0.0943367481231689,-0.811327583389034,Negative
But actually normally in the past after consuming some of our products like the hot topic products or hot trend products those consumers or those users are going to be with us and retain with us to further consume the entertainment and also the other vertical related products.,WB,0.7885439395904541,0.5770876271054906,Positive
But actually because of the COVID19 in the second half of 2020 we had a very good management and also the restrictions on the entertainmentrelated product consumption. So the retention rate of those kind of customers or users dropped.,WB,0.2418731749057769,-0.516254553946587,Negative
So those are the major reasons of causing us to have a decreased number of users in Q2 and Q3 majorly. So in Q4 we have been doing some kind of a work for example increasing the investment to the user acquisition cost. And also we really increased some kind of productization in order to attract and also retain those kind of users.,WB,0.7081606388092041,0.4163209297185717,Positive
Foreign Language And also you can see that we have been doing some kind of things right now because rather than paying attention to MAU now we pay more attention to the total consumption as well as the frequency of the consumption specific.,WB,0.1220357120037078,-0.7559296226081984,Negative
So we can interpret that into the following kind of parameters for example DAU and also some kind of frequency of the consumption and also the total scale of the consumption. So that is actually going to really help us to improve our competitiveness as well as our kind of inventory of the monetization.,WB,0.9871670007705688,0.9743339862430014,Positive
Foreign Language And also in terms of our strategy in the future in 2021 we would like to focus on the following items. So first of all we had our traditional advantage in terms of acquiring those users through our hot trends.,WB,0.7773454189300537,0.5546905724350051,Positive
So in the past in 2020 actually we had some of the issues occurred in terms of increasing retention ratio and also helping the users to actually stay with us more and consume more frequently.,WB,0.0166986882686615,-0.9666037956498835,Negative
So actually in 2021 in Q1 and also later this year we are going to further emphasize on these two particular points. So that is to say first of all emphasizing on the consumptions related to the relationshipbased feed.,WB,0.8719766139984131,0.7439530753809662,Positive
And also we are going to encourage those video accounts to actually publish more videos. And also help and trigger the consumption around the videos by the users. So actually through these kind of ways especially through videos we are going to really help to increase their retention ratio of our users.,WB,0.2437653541564941,-0.5124701931894977,Negative
So actually we are very confident to overcome the difficulty and also get ourselves improved in later this year.,WB,0.076529324054718,-0.8469424527540521,Negative
Foreign Language And also lastly I want to say that in terms of the 2021 trend. So first of all talking about the yearonyear comparison because we had a very high historical figure in Q1 of 2020 so its not that meaningful for us to compare. But actually we are very confident to realize a monthtomonth growth in 2021 Q1.,WB,0.9989417195320128,0.9978834378024564,Positive
And also another thing is that in terms of our channel strategy we are going to really focus on increasing the retention ratio of our users and also really help to build a very good and also healthy growth on the number of users. So we are very much confident in driving the traffic and also driving the activity and also the retention ratio of the users in 2021.,WB,0.9829189777374268,0.965837935112676,Positive
Very helpful. Thank you. Thats all my question.,WB,0.9992128610610962,0.998425721183849,Positive
Your next question comes from the line of Miranda Zhuang of Bank of America. Please ask your question.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Foreign Language Thank you for taking my question. So my question is can you please share the ad spend outlook for the 2021 And what kind of your ad products and services will particularly gain traction and gain incremental budget allocations among your KA and SME clients across different industry sectors Thank you.,WB,0.9966337084770204,0.9932674129411061,Positive
Foreign Language And so let me answer this particular question. So first of all in 2020 Q4 we have been seeing a very good recovery of our KA ad customer especially we returned to the tripledigit growth. And also we although had a yearonyear decrease on SME in Q4 but still that particular decrease rate has been reduced. And also further in 2021 were going to really see a kind of a very good growth on the brand customers especially at the FMCG and also automotives as well as the luxury as well. And also in 2021 were going to see also a very good growth for entertainment as well.,WB,0.9990267753601074,0.99805354956004,Positive
And also next part is about the SME. So this year for example we have seen a very good trend for gaming or Internet service as well as online education et cetera et cetera but actually were not quite sure whether or not we are going to see another doubling effect or doubling results of the gaming industry this year. And also talking about the other traffic diverting related SMEs without a very strong demand on branding actually in 2020 we were talking about those O2O or ecommerce businesses. We had a little bit  another ideal performance in 2020 but still in 2021 we are going to see a further intense competition in the area that I mentioned.,WB,0.9991732835769652,0.998346566168407,Positive
And also next part is about the products. So based on the social nature of Weibo so we are going to really focus continuously on the kind of the strategy of the brand plus performance and also the content and also IPbased marketing strategies. So based on this particular content and IPbased marketing as well as the strategy of brand plus performance we have very good advantage in gaining the budget from the topnotch customers.,WB,0.9999359846115112,0.9998719691467102,Positive
And also we do see that the kind of short video is actually a very big competitor through the OTV area. So we can see that in this particular thing. We do see that those customers from OTV actually had a very high requirement already kind of a content and also the IP as well as the famous KOLs in this area. So based on the unique advantage of Weibo in terms of the IP and KOLs and celebrities we are very much positive to actually have the advantage of those OTV converted or transferred budgets and gaining that.,WB,0.9999951124191284,0.9999902248324304,Positive
And also next part is that we had also a very good development in terms of our information flow like the super FST has been upgraded further. So we are going to see a kind of a tripledigit growth on OCPX as well. And also the gaming as well as the educations as two verticals are increasing dramatically and also because of our upgraded algorithm in this particular area. And also talking about those particular customers they do have the requirement not only to gain traffic but also they would like to do some kind of a brand promotion work. So because of that we are seeing that in 2021 were very much positive to actually have that particular development especially talking about the customer and ecommerce and also Internet services et cetera.,WB,0.999609351158142,0.999218701850594,Positive
Foreign Language Thank you.,WB,0.8524465560913086,0.7048929362851002,Positive
Well take the final question from Alicia Yap of Citigroup. Please ask your question Alicia.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. Also congratulations on the results and the guidance. My questions is related to the ad inventory and also the competitive landscape. So how does management elaborate the situation you are seeing in 2021 versus last year in terms of the ad pricing pressure and the supply for these ad inventory as compared to last year and even as compared to 2019 And also any comment on the margins trend for 2021. Let me translate very quickly. Foreign Language,WB,0.9999983310699464,0.9999966621379033,Positive
Foreign Language So first of all talking about the ad inventory so before in the first question and also to that first question I already mentioned that actually this year in terms of our strategies for the users we are going to actually see that more of our investment and also the productrelated strategies are going to focus more on the DAU and also the consumption frequency of the users and the per capita consumption traffic of the users from the previous major focus on MAU. So thats to say this particular DAU increase and also more frequency of the consumption of users will definitely drive the development and growth of the ad inventory.,WB,0.9778074622154236,0.9556148979752648,Positive
However kind of speaking based on the Q1 result its very difficult for me to give you a kind of forecast about this particular ad inventory in 2021 especially for Q1. And of course we do have seen very good growth on the other video platforms but still we are very much focused on increasing the DAU and also the frequency of consumption of users and these strategies will definitely bring a growth on the ad inventory.,WB,0.9905271530151368,0.9810542947377534,Positive
In terms of your margin question I will try to take this question. With the revenue growth as our primary goal and at the same time we want to enhance our competitiveness of our platform so we may increase our investment in marketing channels compared to last year 2020. So on this basis we expect our operating margin can still reach well in the high level that is to say maybe no less than 30 but there still will be a certain decline maybe the impact the decline will be singledigit maybe 5 compared to the level of last year.,WB,0.9999769926071168,0.9999539851868067,Positive
So in summary in this year the companys all of strategies is mainly focused on improving our revenue growth and continue to improve the competitiveness of the platform at the user product level so the cost and expenses level. The main areas of investment will be increased will improve the marketing channel investment.,WB,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In last year 2020 due to the epidemic and other impact market channel investment was conservative that is down from the year 2019. So considering the competitive user market and leveraging Weibos relatively advantaged new user acquisition costs we will ensure our coverage of basic channels such as free installation and focus on increasing the investment in user engagement.,WB,0.0276358127593994,-0.9447295336303315,Negative
And another area is personnelrelated costs. To maintain  in order to maintain our competitiveness in the market in some key departments as such our advertising business department and our RD department there are certain personnel increase headcount increase and also the salary raise. So last year due to the impact of the pandemic the company also enjoyed some government benefit. This will impact our margin this year. So in summary the effect on our margin will be dropped from yeartoyear.,WB,0.8510754108428955,0.7021506441537404,Positive
Okay. Thank you for the color. Yes thank you.,WB,0.9993734359741212,0.9987468712013194,Positive
This concludes our conference call today. Thank you for joining. Well see you next quarter. Byebye.,WB,0.988127827644348,0.9762556411359553,Positive

I will now turn the call over to Scott Durbin Viveves Chief Executive Officer.,VIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Jeannie. Good afternoon everyone. We really appreciate you joining us today. Id like to start the call this afternoon with a short strategic business summary followed by a high level review of our 2020 full year financial results.,VIVE,0.9999753832817078,0.9999507665340701,Positive
Ill then remark on our Stress Urinary Incontinence clinical development program and the pivotal PURSUIT trial that is underway in the United States. Before opening the call to questions I will close with our plans to achieve an SUI indication and the enormous commercial opportunity it represents.,VIVE,0.1788836419582367,-0.6422336949310868,Negative
2020 was a challenging yet transformational year for Viveve as a result of the dedicated efforts of the entire company and the achievement of critical milestones for our SUI program. Viveve successfully pivoted in 2020 becoming a euro gynecology company with a focus on SUI and launched our pivotal U.S. PURSUIT trial.,VIVE,0.9359105229377748,0.8718209694748937,Positive
As we move forward over the next 18 to 24 months our core areas of strategic focus will be to first continue to advance the clinical development program in SUI by successfully executing the currently underway PURSUIT trial and achieving a positive data read out. Thereafter if positive to commercially launch the first FDA approved patent protected endovaginal officebased treatment for urethral hypermobility to improve SUI in women.,VIVE,0.9943439960479736,0.9886879853534611,Positive
Secondly continue to focus our commercial efforts on the United States and Asia Pacific regions and expand the installed base of systems throughout the world additionally targeting core specialties of urogynecology urology and gynecology. And finally third continue to support our customers to our internal customer care team and successful initiatives which continue to drive increased consumable treatment tip utilization and sales.,VIVE,0.9882115125656128,0.976423011078245,Positive
Before I cover our financial results for the year Id like to comment qualitatively that after a challenging commercial market in 2020 conditions are improving. Receptivity to new technologies from practices is increasing patient flow and procedure volumes are improving and the stagnant and often dormant market we experienced particularly in the U.S. is showing strong signs of improvement in early 2021.,VIVE,0.9980944395065308,0.9961888767414551,Positive
Today we reported total revenue for 2020 of approximately 5.5 million from the global sale of 31 systems and in the U.S. under a recurring revenue model program an additional 29 systems were placed. As of December 31 2020 we now have a total installed base of 857 systems worldwide. Additionally a total of approximately 8900 disposable treatment tips were sold globally in 2020.,VIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Total operating expenses for the year were approximately 18.8 million compared to 31.7 million for 2019. This significant decrease is the result of the companys strategic alignment along with taking operational measures to lower costs and reduced cash burn as we focus our efforts on our SUI program. On a pro forma basis we ended the year in a strong cash position cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds of 25.2 million from the companys January 2021 financing were approximately 31.7 million.,VIVE,0.0316852927207946,-0.936630568880182,Negative
The success of this upsized public offering in January was a testament to the enormous market opportunity for the Viveves noninvasive dual energy technology in SUI and underscores the confidence in the companys strategic path capability to execute and potential to achieve positive clinical results in our U.S. pivotal PURSUIT trial.,VIVE,0.9873613119125366,0.9747226087585741,Positive
Importantly this financing provided us with the capital resources to support operations through the end of 2022 including the planned completion of the PURSUIT trial and as we continue to operate efficiently and at a significantly reduced cash burn rate of 3 million to 4 million a quarter.,VIVE,0.7690899968147278,0.5381797183631172,Positive
Id now like to direct my remarks to our Stress Urinary Incontinence clinical development program. Our successful pivot to SUI in 2020 was fostered by many important milestones that were achieved. These include the positive preclinical and SUI feasibility study results reported positive data that validated our new inner sham treatment tip that produces no tissue nor clinical benefit FDA approval of the strengthened PURSUIT trial investigational device exemption formation of our preeminent clinical advisory board and incontinence and the issuance of a newly issued U.S. SUI method patent.,VIVE,0.999049723148346,0.998099445163873,Positive
At this point Id like to summarize the condition of SUI and the opportunity it represents for those on the call who may be new to Viveve. SUI is a condition that affects an estimated 25 million to 30 million women in the United States alone and based on our estimates it represents a 10 billion to 12 billion total available consumable market opportunity.,VIVE,0.1066431403160095,-0.7867147843329814,Negative
Today few effective noninvasive treatments exist that reduce leakage associated with SUI. In fact the current spectrum of therapeutic options for women is limited to physiotherapy at one end of the spectrum such as Kegel exercises electrical muscle stimulation or biofeedback which are all designed to strengthen the pelvic floor musculature.,VIVE,0.8026171922683716,0.60523414923796,Positive
To the other end of the spectrum in invasive approaches such as bulking agents or sling procedures. Accordingly theres a large gap in the treatment spectrum that represent a tremendous unmet need and an opportunity for a clinically proven treatment option. We believe Viveve has the potential to expand this continuum of care.,VIVE,0.915791153907776,0.8315822074307251,Positive
Our noninvasive endovaginal officebased treatment which can be completed in a physicians office in approximately 45 minutes may safely and effectively improve urethra hypermobility and significantly reduce leakage for women who suffer from SUI.,VIVE,0.8672609329223633,0.7345217076073334,Positive
Moving to an overview of the PURSUIT trial PURSUIT is a randomized doubleblinded sham controlled trial with an intended enrollment of 390 subjects with moderate SUI defined as greater than 10 milliliters up to 50 milliliters of urine leakage on the 1hour Pad Weight Test at up to 30 study sites in the United States. Randomized in a 21 ratio subjects in the active treatment arm will receive our Cryogencooled Monopolar Radiofrequency or CMRF treatment while subjects in the control arm will receive an energy less or inner sham treatment and again I want to highlight that the sham treatment administered in the control group for the study is a clinically inert or a true sham treatment.,VIVE,0.0354662239551544,-0.9290687019042384,Negative
The primary efficacy endpoint of PURSUIT trial in comparison of the proportion of patients who experience greater than a 50 reduction in urine leakage compared to baseline on the standardized and objective 1hour Pad Weight Test at 12 months post treatment versus the inner sham procedure.,VIVE,0.0284756422042846,-0.9430498737394059,Negative
The study also includes several secondary endpoints also assessed using the 1hour Pad Weight Test the three day bladder voiding diary and other behavioral and quality of life questionnaire. Subject safety will also obviously be monitored throughout the study.,VIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Id like to take this moment to acknowledge the guidance and support from the many experts who make up our newly formed clinical advisory board and who contributed to our strengthened and enhanced study design.,VIVE,0.9537047743797302,0.907409493571218,Positive
Currently patient enrollment is under way and is going well and we continue to expect full 390 patient enrollment by the end of the second quarter or very early in the third quarter of this year. And again positive data results from PURSUIT may support a marketing application for a new SUI label in the United States and abroad and open a multibillion commercial opportunity for Viveve.,VIVE,0.9988948702812196,0.997789739245021,Positive
Today Viveve is in a strong position to successfully execute our core strategies over the next 18 to 24 months in advance of and in preparation for a potential FDA approval of an SUI indication in the U.S. In 2021 we now have the capital and resources to execute this strategy a lower cash burn rate a newly designed and highly powered pivotal SUI trial under way in the United States and a shifted commercial priority to the two largest markets in the world the United States and Asia Pacific regions with a focus on expanding our core market installed base and procedure volumes all in a 2021 commercial environment that has begun to significantly improve.,VIVE,0.1160498261451721,-0.7679014014610062,Negative
I thank the talented and dedicated team at Viveve for their tenacity throughout 2020 which has provided us with this tremendous opportunity to potentially expand the SUI continuum of care with a noninvasive endovaginal treatment option for millions of women who suffer from SUI.,VIVE,0.9174970388412476,0.8349939793312426,Positive
Again Id like to thank everyone for participating in our conference call today.,VIVE,0.9702367782592772,0.9404735210380082,Positive
Operator this concludes our prepared remarks and we can open the call to any questions. Thank you.,VIVE,0.9906309843063354,0.9812619574439272,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,VIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions Our first question today will come from Jeffrey Cohen with Ladenburg Thalmann.,VIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi Scott How are you,VIVE,0.9321828484535216,0.8643656160626505,Positive
Hi Jeff how are you Thanks for joining today.,VIVE,0.9888368844985962,0.9776737556897137,Positive
No problem its a pleasure to be here. So a couple of questions on the enrollment. You expect that how has that occurred throughout the centers number of centers that are enrolling now are how many,VIVE,0.99515962600708,0.9903192462439812,Positive
Yeah we are up to Id say a little over 20 centers right now who are currently enrolling. Weve got a handful that are in the IRB process or going through site initiation visits and training but we expect them to be up to speed in the next couple of weeks.,VIVE,0.1590949296951294,-0.6818111430472988,Negative
Okay and theres no type of eminent looks or the Pad Weight measurement is at month 12 or you are taking looks at earlier months,VIVE,0.1601661443710327,-0.6796687124185041,Negative
So we are taking both three and six months looks on Pad Weight from a responder perspective and also from a mean change and baseline perspective as well as 3day voiding diary you know collecting those at those time points as well. But we wont have we wont have an unblinded ph look at any of those time points but we will have them at the end of the 12 month study.,VIVE,0.94845712184906,0.8969141822541844,Positive
Okay got it. And then back to your base business currently could you talk about that a little more. It feels like theres some upside that this had on the utilization in the revenues. Could you call that out as far as geographies that youre seeing recently and obviously we dont expect any guidance but it feels like at the moment 21 could be guided into 20 on the top line at least from how we are looking at it,VIVE,0.8886400461196899,0.777279959487891,Positive
Yeah we certain expect it to Jeff. You know 2020 was obviously difficult particularly in the United States where the Asia Pacific region recovered far more quickly in 2020 and actually contributed quite strongly to the 2020 results. But here at the beginning as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and 2021 I think its  we are certain the market is improving were certainly seeing clinics that had to close down in 2020 reopen up order tips start to treat patients see and improve patient flow. So were optimistic that were on the uptick here and that should translate into a better year for us from a financial perspective.,VIVE,0.9999982118606568,0.9999964237191821,Positive
Okay and then as far as OpEx going forward it sounds like the baseline from 2020 carries through to 2021 plus I dont know 10 to 30 based upon on the clinical work as well as perhaps additional resources needed for the higher trajectory on revenues.,VIVE,0.1271747946739196,-0.7456514511415073,Negative
Yeah I think 10 to 30 is probably a good range in terms of increasing OpEx for 2021. Weve worked hard as you know over the last 18 months or so to sort of reduce the cash burn and start to level set the financial statements and improve just operational efficiency. And so were going to continue to improve that as we go into 2021 and while well see an uptick in 2021 on the RD line due to the trial being mostly conducted this year you know these are tremendously expensive trials and so it wont be significant.,VIVE,0.0072396397590637,-0.9855219039451504,Negative
Got it and then lastly for us is just walk us through share count as of current inclusive of the additional shares from our endofyear or beginning of the year.,VIVE,0.8575153946876526,0.7150306195203182,Positive
Yes so we ended we ended 2020 with 10.3 or we filed the 10K with 10.3 million common shares outstanding which reflects the shares issued  common shares issued in the January financing.,VIVE,0.9559091329574584,0.9118182133544761,Positive
Okay got it perfect. That does it for us. Thanks for taking the questions.,VIVE,0.9953070878982544,0.9906141702021183,Positive
Okay thanks so much for joining Jeff. I appreciate it.,VIVE,0.9991751313209534,0.998350261658586,Positive
And our next question will come from Ben Haynor with AGP.,VIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the transformation and progress over the last year or so.,VIVE,0.9977906942367554,0.9955813858398115,Positive
Thanks so much Ben. Welcome and thanks for joining.,VIVE,0.9998509287834167,0.9997018573891268,Positive
Yeah no problem. So you said youre at 20 or so sites a handful more kind of going through the process. It sounds like the way youre characterizing the enrollment its effectively on track with what you expected there.,VIVE,0.9589794874191284,0.9179589259379661,Positive
Is that the right read and then also is there a chance that you ultimately dont get to the 30 sites just to maybe some of these sites that are more impacted from COVID or other matters just ultimately dont get ramped up before you roll the thing.,VIVE,0.2342534065246582,-0.5314940997923016,Negative
Yeah I think its fair to say you know were at where we expect it to be. Its always a ramp up when you begin and we began  we announced enrollment on January 21 so its been a little less than two months here. And then it tends to accelerate as you get all the sites up and screening and treating patients and dealing with the flow through of the various advertising campaigns that are going on locally around each of our clinic sites. And so you know right now we feel like were on track to hit our enrollment target of the end of the second quarter or you know very early in July.,VIVE,0.7659869194030762,0.5319735598406552,Positive
Okay so by the 4th of July youll have it all enrolled right,VIVE,0.8994625210762024,0.7989249223023189,Positive
Well we certainly hope so and were certainly on track for that right now. You know we obviously always wanted to go quicker. We knew we were going to face certain challenges coming into the execution of the trial from enrollment and followup perspective in this environment but I think we learned a lot in 2020 having run the feasibility study and you know try to incorporate those learnings into this very important study for us and I think were on track and I expect well get you know right up to or at or very near to the 30 site at the end of the day.,VIVE,0.9299122095108032,0.8598243354703996,Positive
Okay. Thats defiantly helpful. And then just looking at some of these secondary endpoints and it looks like youve kind of altered them or at least a couple few on them since the original trial design came out before you boosted the patient count.,VIVE,0.0641196072101593,-0.8717619012367137,Negative
Can you maybe talk about some of these secondary end points and you know why you add some or simple ones that are chosen. I mean it seems like there are few that maybe could help us kind of get the patient guidance on when they could expect the results or was that a consideration. What went into some of these changes,VIVE,0.9924964904785156,0.9849929720121455,Positive
Yeah I think the most important change is really the addition of the three month time point and that was really done for precisely the reason you just highlighted which is you know if as we expect sort of to get to a positive outcome from this trial it will be important from there as we achieve an FDA clearance and begin to be able to finally market onlabel in the United States and elsewhere for SUI.,VIVE,0.9953980445861816,0.9907960836864016,Positive
That you know physicians have a sense for the onset of improvement in symptoms or leakage and by adding the three month endpoint it really gives a nice time history of improvement because we can look back at voiding episodes we can look at mean change from baseline on the Pad Weight Test in addition to responder rates and really get a sense of the time sequence of outcome and that can be communicated to patients once were on a label from the physician in terms of setting expectations. Because as you know ours is a tissue mechanism of action that based on our history in the many clinical trials weve run and the sort of vast commercial experience we have today we know that it takes 30 to 90 days for the tissues to remodel and for women to start seeing clinical improvement in their symptoms. And so thats the main change to  is really adding the three month time point to the pad Weight Tests and to the voiding diary.,VIVE,0.9999985694885254,0.9999971389753455,Positive
Got it. That makes a lot of sense and then obviously SUI is an embracement conditions. So it makes sense that people are suffering from it or are kind of reluctant to discuss and thats why you get that kind of broad spectrum of estimates in terms of you know whats the number of women in the U.S. that have it.,VIVE,0.7940157055854797,0.5880311656183992,Positive
But I did notice it sounds like youre looking more at 25 million to 30 million based upon some of the prepared remarks where you said in the press release whereas like we caught you previously talking more or less kind of the 11 million range. Is that maybe including a little bit more of a mixed UI or why the higher figure now.,VIVE,0.7957194447517395,0.5914386459819352,Positive
Yeah so its a great question and thanks for asking it because I think its important to clarify that when we talk about you know 25 million to 30 million women in the U.S. with you know with stress incontinence its was some form of stress incontinence and as you know theres pure stress incontinence there is pure urge incontinence and then there is this enormous population of patients who have a little bit of both which they refer to as mixed.,VIVE,0.9991649389266968,0.9983298768579225,Positive
And so when we talk about 25 million to 30 million women in the United States have some form of stress urinary incontinence its including pure SUI and most of the mix patience. But as you drill down on that and really what were focused on you know with stress in particular is making sure were identifying patients who have predominant SUI and so when we talk about 10 million or 11 million 12 million of those patients who would be candidates for as of the procedure were really honing in on those patients who are predominantly SUI and there are a variety of clinical mechanisms to differentiate whether a patient has more stress incontinence or more urge incontinence.,VIVE,0.0208193063735961,-0.9583625545278518,Negative
And so thats the difference in those two numbers Ben.,VIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay that masks sense. You know obviously either way its a fairly massive market.,VIVE,0.9139567613601683,0.8279134201487421,Positive
It certainly is.,VIVE,0.8812974691390991,0.7625947967736701,Positive
Good deal. Well I think thats all I have for this afternoon. Good luck with the enrolment and thanks for taking the question again.,VIVE,0.999883472919464,0.9997669457000169,Positive

JeanPaul Kress,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Julia. Good morning and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In 2020 we delivered one of the most successful years in the companys history. It was truly a transformational year with the accelerated approval of Monjuvi as the first and only secondline treatment for patients with relapsedrefractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma who are not eligible for stem cell transplant. We are incredibly proud of this achievement. As this is just the beginning and we are looking forward to building momentum over time. We believe tafasitamab has the potential to transform the standard of care in DLBCL and will lead to a paradigm shift in how patients will B cell malignancies are treated.,MOR,0.999980926513672,0.9999618530046066,Positive
We are looking to rapidly expand the tafasitamab opportunity through label expansion and exploring tafasitamab in combination with other approved or emerging compounds. The execution in brining this important breakthrough therapy to the market for patients has created a strong foundation for MorphoSys as in integrated commercial biopharmaceutical company. Throughout the year we continue to progress and expand our pipeline in the areas of hematology oncology and autoimmune diseases. We presented very encouraging preliminary Phase 1b data from our firstline study in firstline DLBCL that paves the way to initiate our pivotal frontline study in the coming months.,MOR,0.9957194328308104,0.991438860558784,Positive
Turning to business development activities at the start of 2020 we entered into an important global commercial and development partnership with Incyte for tafasitamab. We are excited that we entered into a development collaboration with Xencor to evaluate the combination of tafasitamab with Xencors bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody plamotamab aiming to help more patients with certain nonHodgkin lymphoma. And shifting gears to our financials for the year we reported very solid results with revenue of roughly 320 million and EBIT 27 million. Revenue in part included 18.5 million from the product sales of Monjuvi. We also significantly strengthened our balance sheet and we have completed all of this in the middle of the global pandemic.,MOR,0.99618399143219,0.9923679783153407,Positive
Moving to slide six our business model currently represents three pillars guiding future value creation. The first pillar will drive value from our own commercialization efforts. We were excited to start booking U.S. sales for Monjuvi in the third quarter of 2020. We see great potential to expand its use by becoming a standard of care and a backbone in NHL which will derive increased commercial opportunities. Another asset I would like to highlight in this pillar is felzartamab. It could become an attractive opportunity as a treatment for select autoimmune diseases where the unmet medical disease is high starting with autoimmune membranous nephropathy.,MOR,0.9999508261680604,0.999901652277501,Positive
Our second value drivers are royalties and milestones from our partnered and outlicensed programs. Our program with Janssen Tremfya is approved for psoriasis Ph and psoriatic arthritis in the U.S. EU and other countries. We are very pleased with the commercial success of Tremfya and look forward to Janssen developing Tremfya for use in additional indications. Other latestage partnered programs include GSKs otilimab for rheumatoid arthritis and COVIDrelated severe respiratory distress syndrome as well as Roches gantenerumab for Alzheimers disease. And the third value driver is our research platform that has been the foundation for MorphoSys success with cuttingedge antibody technologies.,MOR,0.9979087710380554,0.9958175395831701,Positive
We are continually enriching it with nextgeneration platforms to drive further groundbreaking innovation. In November we signed a license agreement with Cherry Biolabs for a potentially exciting nextgeneration Hemibody technology. We believe these three pillars will driver shareholder value.,MOR,0.9469010829925536,0.8938021026862277,Positive
Moving to slide seven our top priority is the continued execution of the Monjuvi launch where we are very encouraged by the early progress. We continue to get positive feedback from physicians and have maintained leading share of voice of approximately 50. We anticipate the potential for viability for the first twoyear of launch during the global pandemic but we are confident in the longterm trajectory for Monjuvi.,MOR,0.9988223314285278,0.9976446614531644,Positive
And beyond our current secondline indication we are rapidly expanding tafasitamab in additional hematologic oncology indications and are planning the initiation of two pivotal trials in the firsthalf of this year including the initiation of a pivotal trial in firstline DLBCL called FontMIND in the coming month. The second pivotal trial called LMIND for follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma is set to start soon. The follicular lymphoma indication received orphan designation in January of this year. With tafasitamabs differentiated profile it has the potential to be a partner of choice. As I mentioned earlier we are also advancing other pipeline assets including tafasitamab where we expect to get proofofconcept data in the coming month.,MOR,0.9679684638977052,0.9359368896108209,Positive
And finally our disciplined capital allocation strategy is an important component as we focus on balancing investments in our internal pipeline along with potential external opportunities that are a strategic fit. 2020 was a year marked by many important accomplishments encouraged by the approval of Monjuvi. We look forward to keeping you updated on our key initiatives during the year.,MOR,0.9999344348907472,0.9998688697033347,Positive
With that I would now like to turn the call over to Roland for our commercial update.,MOR,0.9046577215194702,0.8093153293820199,Positive
Thank you JeanPaul and hello everyone. Moving to slide nine 2020 was indeed an exciting year for us and one of our defining moments was the accelerated approval of Monjuvi in late July. From FDA approval through the end of December we delivered on a rapid speed to market achieving major launch milestones within days of approval. In fact the first Monjuvi order shipment patient dose and inclusion in NCCN guidelines all happened within the first 30 days following approval. We ensured rapid and robust payer access and coverage for Monjuvi through commercial and government channels is wellestablished.,MOR,0.9955796003341676,0.991159195398805,Positive
Now taking a closer look at Q4 the first book order for Monjuvi in the marketplace we reported 70 million in sales for the quarter and 22 million for the year. Q4 Monjuvi sales were primarily driven by demand and also benefited from a thirdparty clinical trial supply order and some select NGOs inventory buying at the close of the year. The latter two factors contributed about 1 million in Monjuvi sales in Q4.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Moving to slide 10 we were very encouraged by the continued traction we saw in the number of accounts ordering Monjuvi. During our last call we shared that more than 250 sites of care had ordered by the end of October with 80 reordering. By the end of December we saw a significant increase with cumulative orders from more than 400 sites since launch. Key academic centers continue to be strongly interested in Monjuvi and we are seeing increased momentum in community care indicating the broad accessibility of Monjuvi for patients in both academic and community settings. Given that we are already quite advanced in first quarter we want to share some reflections on the start of the year. After strong momentum in 2020 and while uptake in second line continues to increase we saw the first months of 2021 impacted by two factors.,MOR,0.9993021488189696,0.9986042968060354,Positive
First the unprecedented surge in the COVID pandemic after the holidays impacted sites of care across the U.S. and limited our ability to see physicians. While they continue to maintain a leading share of voice of about 50 and see continued interest in our messages the COVID surge slowed down our engagement of key physicians. Second as a result of the winter storms across the U.S. in February we expect some patients in their early cycles have their treatment temporarily interrupted. These factors may impact our Q1 results. However we are seeing treatment levels in the last few weeks return to the momentum we built at the end of 2020. In fact we are very encouraged by the feedback we are receiving from prescribers especially the physicians who saw our two year data for secondline patients at ASH are intrigued by the long duration of response. The appropriate indication of prescribers with this data is a priority for our team.,MOR,0.011401355266571,-0.9771984679689814,Negative
Our focus in 2021 is to lay the foundation for longterm growth. We expect the gradual build from Monjuvi as we drive increased uptake in secondline and as patients who respond to continue treatment to progression over time. Monjuvi safe and tolerability profile together with its duration of response support the paradigm shift in the treatment of relapsedrefractory DLBCL. Our treatment regimen to treat patients with Monjuvi to progression makes the two year longterm data relevant not only for patient benefit but also from a business perspective. And we are looking forward to sharing with you is three year longterm data in an upcoming conference.,MOR,0.7824670076370239,0.5649337559543586,Positive
As we continue to establish Monjuvi as the standard of care for appropriate patients with relapserefractory DLBCL who are progressing from firstline and are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. We never lose sight that nearly 10000 DLBCL patients in the U.S. could benefit from the promise of Monjuvi each year. It is our mission to bring this important new treatment for them.,MOR,0.928414225578308,0.856828365819672,Positive
Thank you. And Ill now turn the call over to my colleague Malte.,MOR,0.9564604759216307,0.9129208999400733,Positive
Thank you Roland. As JeanPaul and Roland have mentioned we are very proud of all our accomplishments in 2020 highlighted by the U.S. approval of Monjuvi. We have achieved FDA approval with an innovative approach in record time with a secondline labor which is the foundation of making Monjuvi available for many patients suffering from relapsedrefractory DLBCL.,MOR,0.9999734163284302,0.9999468326251701,Positive
I would now like to concentrate on the outlook for this year 2021. And let me start with tafasitamab. The key areas of focus for 2021 are rapidly extending the tafasitamab opportunity by label expansion and exploring tafasitamab in combination with other approved or emerging compounds.,MOR,0.9966599941253662,0.9933199842691327,Positive
Regarding the evolving LMIND data the durability of responses is an important differentiator for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL treated with Monjuvi in combination with lenalidomide. Data from the twoyear cut off showed a median duration of response of close to three years along with a median overall survival of 31.6 months. Patients in this study who achieved a complete response have a greater than 85 chance to remain in complete remission after two years and a greater than 90 chance to be alive after two years.,MOR,0.0841931700706482,-0.8316147515861699,Negative
This benefit was especially pronounced for patients who are treated with Monjuvi and lenalidomide as a secondline treatment. In these patients we could observe an overall response rate of 67.5 as well as a 24 months overall survival rate of 67.9. These data combined with Monjuvi safety and tolerability profile support a paradigm shift for traditionally difficult to treat patients potentially offering longterm disease control. We are looking forward to the next threeyear cut off and we are confident that we will be able to provide further evidence supporting Monjuvis duration of response. This data will be presented at one of the upcoming medical conferences.,MOR,0.9192000031471252,0.8383999099730908,Positive
Beyond relapsedrefractory DLBCL our focus is on the rapid expansion of the clinical development of tafasitamab into earlier lines of treatment as well as into additional indications. It is our aim to develop tafasitamab as the backbone treatment for patients with DLBCL and other Bcell hematological malignancies. We have started to investigate tafasitamab and lenalidomide in firstline DLBCL with the aim to improve cure rates and to create a new standard of care regimen. Theres a high unmet needs for DLBCL patients in the firstline setting especially those at highrisk with an IPI score of three to five. For these patients the chances of cure with RCHOP alone are less than 50.,MOR,0.0523349642753601,-0.8953312011547095,Negative
We presented the initial results of our FirstMIND Phase 1b study at ASH at the end of last year. And we are very encouraged that the study showed an initial response rate of 91.1 in a patient population that overall had a poor prognosis. The results also showed that the combination of tafasitamablenalidomide and RCHOP did not show unexpected toxicity which is very encouraging.,MOR,0.9988178014755248,0.9976356015417582,Positive
We completed enrollment in the FirstMIND study one month ahead of schedule which shows the great interest in this potential treatment options. We will provide a more detailed update of this data including CR and PR rate at a medical conference in the near future.,MOR,0.994627833366394,0.9892556603286626,Positive
The FirstMIND data are the basis for our Phase 3 study frontMIND and we are on track to start this study soon. frontMIND will enroll up to 900 patients and will evaluate the tafasitamablenalidomide combination in addition to RCHOP compared to RCHOP alone. We believe we can make a difference by adding this potent synergistic combination starting treatment promptly within 28 days and focusing on high risk patients. Our ambition is to improve cure rates in DLBCL in all treatment lines. Beyond DLBCL we will expand the use of tafasitamab into other indications and plan to start a pivotal study in indolent lymphoma another area with high unmet needs particularly for high risk patients. We are planning to inMIND study of the tafasitamablenalidomide combination in patients with follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma in the firsthalf of 2021.,MOR,0.99878191947937,0.997563837506674,Positive
Tafasitamab is uniquely suited as a combination partner and a backbone of choice given its safety profile. Therefore we are excited to evaluate the combination of tafasitamab with Xencors bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody plamotamab in patients with relapsed refractory DLBCL frontline DLBCL and relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma aiming to help more patients in this area of high unmet medical needs. Insight just leading development efforts evaluating the combination of tafasitamab with PI3 kinase delta inhibitor parsaclisib in a proofofconcept study.,MOR,0.998600959777832,0.9972019178878773,Positive
In addition there is increasing interest from other companies to assess tafasitamab in combination with their compounds. As an example Karyopharm is testing tafasitamab in combination with selinexor in DLBCL patients.,MOR,0.9593976736068726,0.9187952988119714,Positive
To conclude on tafasitamab we are excited about the progress we have made regarding our comprehensive development program. We are also very proud of how we have transformed our RD organization during the submission and approval process of Monjuvi. We can now say that we are in full swing of launching large pivotal trials with labeling expansion intent which would it be some foundation for bringing Monjuvi to as many patients as possible.,MOR,0.99998939037323,0.9999787807338123,Positive
Now on slide 13 turning to felzartamab our anti CD38 antibody that we believe has the potential to have an impact for patients with autoimmune diseases. With this anti CD38 antibody we specifically target plasma cells. The source of auto antibodies and therefore potentially provides a targeted treatment for patients. Felzartamab is currently being evaluated in the MPLACE study in patients with autoimmune membranous nephropathy or AMN disease that impact 10000 patients per year in the United States alone.,MOR,0.1417178511619568,-0.7165653208287482,Negative
The fact that 30 to 40 of patients progress to endstage renal disease within 5 to 15 years underscores the high unmet need in this indication. We have made progress with our MPLACE study despite a brief pause due to COVID. And we anticipate having data in the firsthalf of this year. We are prepared to move forward with a comprehensive development strategies and have therefore already started as scheduled findings study new place to define the optimal regimen. In addition we will expand the program in other autoimmune diseases. And lastly our partner IMab is developing felzartamab for the treatment of multiple myeloma and is currently running two pivotal trials.,MOR,0.0557602643966674,-0.8884805968288166,Negative
Before I hand over to Sung I want to briefly comment on the preliminary results from the OSCAR study that our licensing partner GSK announced recently. The data suggests an important clinical benefit of otilimab in a predefined subgroup of high risk patients namely patients that are 70 years or older. Given the urgent public health needs GSK has amended the OSCAR study to expand this cohort to confirm these potentially significant findings.,MOR,0.0069046020507812,-0.9861919797611117,Negative
Were happy that GSK with otilimab is a part of the efforts to find treatments for patients suffering from severe forms of COVID19. And with that Id like to hand over the call to Sung.,MOR,0.825285792350769,0.6505713764258483,Positive
Thank you Malte. Were pleased to share our financial results for the fourth quarter and fullyear 2020. 2020 was a transformative year where we began recording net product sales for the first time and significantly strengthened our balance sheet.,MOR,0.99541574716568,0.9908314888665015,Positive
Moving to slide 15 Group revenues for the fourth quarter were 36 million and 327.7 million for the fullyear. The fourth quarter marked the first full quarter of Monjuvi sales which came in at 14.1 million and 18.5 million for the fullyear. Royalties from net sales of Tremfya in the fourth quarter were 12.1 million and 42.5 million for the fullyear.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to expenses cost of sales was 9.4 million in the fourth quarter and 9.2 million for the fullyear. For the fullyear cost of sales benefited 9.9 million from the reversal of inventory impairments taken in the prioryear. RD expenses in the fourth quarter were 54.8 million and 141.4 million for the fullyear. Growth over 2019 reflects primarily the increased investment to support the advancement of our proprietary programs and impairment charges taken against legacy deals.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
SGA expenses in the fourth quarter were 47 million and 159.1 million for the fullyear. The fullyear growth was anticipated and driven by the build out of the commercial infrastructure to prepare for and launch Monjuvi and investments to support the overall growth of the business.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For 2020 we reported a consolidated net profit of 97.9 million compared to a net loss of 103 million in 2019. Profitability in 2020 was driven primarily by the recognition of 236.1 million as part of the upfront consideration from our partner Incyte. We ended the year with a liquidity position of more than 1.2 billion compared to 357.4 million at the end of 2019. With our strong balance sheet and cash position were well capitalized to execute on our growth strategy.,MOR,0.9027588367462158,0.8055175575718627,Positive
Turning to our guidance for 2021 on slide 16 we anticipate group revenues to be in the range of 150 million to 200 million. This forecast includes the recently announced 16 million milestone payments from GSK. The range also captures the potential for variability from the first fullyear of the Monjuvi product launch and the impact from the pandemic which we believe will be greater in the firsthalf of this year. Operating expenses inclusive of Incytes share of Monjuvi selling costs are anticipated to be in the range of 355 million to 385 million with RD expenses expected to comprise 45 to 50 of this range.,MOR,0.9696460962295532,0.9392921562744119,Positive
RD investments will be focused on the continued development of tafasitamab and felzartamab earlystage development programs and further development of our technologies. As our income statement evolves due to the growth and prominence of certain categories we will adapt accordingly and provide guidance on the measures we believe are helpful to the investment community.

Thank you Sung. Before we go to the QA session I wanted to take a moment to thank all of our colleagues and partners for their commitment and dedication during what has been unprecedented time during the COVID19 pandemic over the past year. I am incredibly proud of what we were able to achieve and the momentum we were able to build for the benefit of patients in the context. Thank you.

QuestionandAnswer Session,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Ladies and Gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions The first question is by Geoffrey Porges.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you very much. Appreciate the questions and the clarity. So a couple for Sung if we could on the guidance so first dumb question but is your operating expense guidance including cost of goods. Secondly is your gross margin profile for Q4 likely to be where you will be going forward And then just in terms of your SGA it implies that your SGA is roughly going to be flat at the fourth quarter level I believe. So I just want to clarify that. And then lastly if you do secure approval in the EU for Monjuvi would you expect there to be a milestone payment Thank you.,MOR,0.999759554862976,0.9995191094393188,Positive
Great. Geoff thanks for all those questions. And please remind me if I have skipped one. But your first question about COG that is not part of our operating expense. So just to be clear operating expense is RD and SGA expenses. In terms of gross margin percent I think this will be relatively stable as were exiting last year. We dont see that much variability this year. And I can even provide some additional color on that. For this year you can expect it to be in the midtohigh 70s okay. And thats product gross margin. In terms of sales expenses or SGA you had mentioned that Q4  could we expect it to be basically the run rate of Q4. I think youre thinking about it the right way.,MOR,0.9999669790267944,0.9999339580142248,Positive
And basically as the increase in SGA is largely driven by the fullyear impact of the Monjuvi selling expenses. And these were not built at the same time in 2020. So theres a staggering effect in 2020 and we just expect to see the fullyear impact of that. And then in terms of milestones for the potential approval of Monjuvi in the EU I think is a very important question and Id like to make this very clear. That event of potential approval of Monjuvi in the EU does not trigger any milestone payments to MorphoSys. Further to that the initiation of the frontline study for firstline DLBCL that also would not trigger a milestone to MorphoSys.,MOR,0.9984588623046876,0.9969177227721948,Positive
And just to wrap up the response I think the last two points the milestones. As Ive come into my seat and taken a fresh look at the various estimates out there in the investor community that seemed to be the biggest area of disconnect. So hopefully by this communication today it demystifies the milestone story for this year.,MOR,0.9255226850509644,0.8510452813179978,Positive

The next question is by James Gordon from JPMorgan.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hello James Gordon JPMorgan. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one just on Monjuvi and the 21 implied U.S. revenue outlook. Since the guidance if I understand it right seems to imply that Monjuvi should do something like 65 million to 115 million for the year and the bottom end of that seems to be only about 15 above annualizing what you already did in Q4. So there are two questions. One is heard the comments on Q1 headwind do you actually think Q1 is going to see any growth on Q4 or could Q1 even be flat or down based on what youre seeing,MOR,0.9927728176116944,0.985545626607911,Positive
I heard comments on COVID and winter storm. And for the fullyear what are you assuming about how long COVID headwinds persist for do you think things are going to get a lot better in the secondhalf or is the guidance assuming things as bad for COVID as is Q1 for the whole year And more longerterm on Monjuvi so I know there was a guidance before that Monjuvi was going to hit a peak in the U.S. in refractory patients with 500 million to 750 million. I didnt see that side on the slide. So is that being reiterated today or are you being a bit more cautious there for various reasons including maybe competition from CD3 CD20s or anything else,MOR,0.900815486907959,0.8016308555786942,Positive
And then just the second question would be Polivy and the Polaris firstline data coming up from Roche. So in the event that we do get positive data there over the next few months in frontline DLBCL what do you think that means for Monjuvi Does that reduce the opportunity in refractory patients at all Any thoughts like what that could mean please,MOR,0.1867903470993042,-0.6264202752234191,Negative
JeanPaul Kress,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So James thanks for your question. This is JeanPaul. Ill address two and three and Roland will come back to the Monjuvi 2021 sales. Regarding peak sales the 500 million to 750 million youre mentioning is still our assumption. And of course putting some caveats on potential market share and mark evolution this is what we have in mind now. And also bear in mind this is for the current indication in the United States. So if you count on potential other territories we should be north of 1 billion for this indication. And obviously this doesnt include potential line extensions other indications and potential combinations because as we stated a couple of times really important to keep in mind that part of the great potential of Monjuvi as we see it is the backbone strategy when we will combine with other modalities starting with Len Ph obviously but also with the Xencor bispecific and potentially other modalities and compounds. In terms of your question on another event for firstline we dont really comment on competition.,MOR,1.0,1.0,Positive
That being said obviously we watch this space very closely. And we are extremely confident in our approach for firstline based on the strengths of our regimen probably the efficacy durability combined with our safety and convenience make us very confident that we can be a key player in firstline regardless of other events. And again this is good news for the patients that there will be a couple of regimen in this indication. And last but not least it speaks to the size of the opportunity in firstline. Bear in mind that there is 30000 new U.S. patients every year in firstline so no wonder why there are a couple of companies trying to cut the cord here. But again we remain very very confident in our approach.,MOR,0.9994365572929382,0.9988731139142,Positive
And Malte could elaborate on why so in the future but Id like to address your first question on Monjuvi for the year and Roland will address that.,MOR,0.9629629850387572,0.9259259259259256,Positive
Yes thank you James. Speaking about Q1 our quarter of course still ongoing and we look forward to sharing the results for Q1 shortly. We just thought that given that were quite forward into the quarter already it was worth to give a headsup regarding COVID impact and winter storm and also to share the continued positive feedback that were hearing from prescribers around the profile for Monjuvi and especially those prescribers that have seen our longterm data at ASH for secondline patients how intrigued they are with the duration of response.,MOR,0.9997105598449708,0.9994211193449019,Positive
Looking at the rest of this year and at COVID with vaccinations hopefully gaining more traction as we move forward our team is prepared to engage healthcare professionals increasingly in person from the middle of this year which will be important especially with the new data that we look forward to sharing at medical conferences in summer. And as you think about the uptake of Monjuvi as we said before expect a gradual build. We spoke about the 10000 patients in the U.S. therefore 5000 in secondline where were the only ones that are approved. We are looking at an increase uptake in those secondline patients. And also as we continue to have traction in secondline we expect that the average duration of response which of course is shorter in lateline patients will continue to build over time. So all of this ladders up to what JeanPaul just shared regarding our outlook and potential that we see for Monjuvi and how we are looking at this year.,MOR,1.0,1.0,Positive
Okay next question operator,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The next question is by Graig Suvannavejh from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open now.,MOR,0.9145361185073853,0.8290721351338239,Positive
Thank you very much. Good afternoon and good morning. Thanks for taking my questions Ive got three. My first is on Monjuvi I believe current consensus for 2021 is about 125 million for Monjuvi. I just wanted to know if you would comment on whether the company is comfortable with that current consensus number. So thats my first question.,MOR,0.999826431274414,0.9996528623419176,Positive
My second question just is on the OpEx guidance for the year and I just want to make sure that Im not missing anything. I believe that the fourth quarter OpEx was about 111 million in total OpEx and  but the guidance for the year is 355 million to 385 million so just wondering if you could reconcile if you annualize fourth quarter over 400 million and so I just wanted to maybe get some more clarity as to how we should be thinking about SGA and RD. So thats my second question. And then my third question just has to do with felzartamab and the data that were expecting. Are you comfortable this time sharing like if you do get positive data what the potential of that asset is in other autoimmune indications whether youve got already internally a list of five or 10 indications that you think felzartamab would be potentially appropriate for Thanks.,MOR,0.0679682791233062,-0.8640645528224427,Negative

Okay great thanks JeanPaul. And appreciate the question. With regard to your question on the consensus Monjuvi estimates out there obviously we come out with guidance. And obviously there has been a reaction. And Ive seen many followup or notes written with new ranges. Ill just simply refer you to slide 16 because I think weve laid out the revenue guidance there pretty well where you can back into a reasonable range. For instance the low end of our range 150 million the high end 200 million we have stated that this is inclusive of the 16 million milestone that was triggered for otilimab from GSK. We have also said that we expect moderate yearoveryear growth for Tremfya. And of course lots here the royalties here 42.5 million. So we expect again moderate growth.,MOR,0.9999828338623048,0.999965667704146,Positive
The range does not include any other significant milestones. And as I mentioned in my first response to Geoffs question we are not expecting any outside milestone for EU approval or the initiation of the frontline study. Now with all those components given I think you can reasonably get to a range. And I would say this range were very comfortable with. Given in the backdrop of COVID we have to make sure that we accounted for a situation that persists into the secondhalf. And also you have the first year of launch of Monjuvi which comes with its own variability. So this is a range were comfortable with.,MOR,0.9990113973617554,0.9980227935450039,Positive
With regard to your question on OpEx and the reconciliation of the Q4 as a proxy Q4 operating expense was just shy of 102 million. There are some onetimers in there. So if you back those out thats basically how you get to a lower operating expense visvis a run rate from Q4. So I hope that gives you some additional color.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Regarding your question on felzartamab basically we have as you know we have started to pioneer on our mutual indication autoimmune response on membranous nephropathy and were close to proofofconcept here were actually ready to roll out pending proofofconcept in this first indication to roll out other indications in a disciplined way based on developments visibility unmet need competitive intensity and obviously commercial potential. Again this indiscernible modality in autoimmune diseases makes a lot of sense because we act on the plasma cells which produce the pathogenic auto antibody and were very encouraged with what weve seen already in our proofofconcept study. And we hope we can communicate on that in the next couple of months.,MOR,0.981202244758606,0.9624044671085281,Positive

Hello thank you for taking my questions. Ive got three please. So on the frontMIND you mentioned the study starts in the next couple of months but weve known the study design for quite a while since then back into last year at your Monjuvi experts when can we expect to start the drug start if any delay purely down to COVID And the Polarex trial youre going to be reading out in the next couple of months as well. So are you potentially looking for or waiting to look at what could happen there could be design of frontMIND change with the results of Polarex thats number one. Number two on the milestones for Monjuvi could you give us an idea of what could you get the milestones so it sounds like theres not a lot coming in 2021 Are the milestones are the regulatory milestones are they pretty much attached to approvals in frontline DLBCL indiscernible and other indications. And thirdly on your backbone strategy for Monjuvi since obviously the Incyte deal and the Xencor deal there hadnt been a lot of activity in terms of combinations you mentioned carry. But is it going to be on you to start a trial sort of a basket trial of potential combinations with the other CD20 assets with the other ADCs to sort of kick start that process Or could we be hearing something later on in the year with other combinations Thank you.,MOR,0.9999998807907104,0.9999997615812788,Positive

Yes thanks JeanPaul. Just reiterating were quite excited about the upcoming start of frontMIND were on track and we remember last time we spoke publicly we highlighted that we would start frontMIND in the firsthalf of this year and were fully on track to accomplish this. In terms of our excitement about frontMIND we believe we have really found an optimal design of the study combining ours with actually two targeted immunomodulatory agents tafasitamab and lenalidomide we are very closely watching the time it requires to start treatments well use good lenalidomide dose were concentrating on patients who are in most need of an approved treatments namely the IPI 3 to 5 patients. And were really encouraged by our preliminary data of firstMIND which we have shot at ASH with an overall response rate of over 90. And lastly currently were the only meaningful Phase 3 study in frontline DLBCL. So we expect actually a very high degree of excitement regarding our frontMIND program.,MOR,0.999998927116394,0.9999978542315091,Positive

Okay good. So let me take that as well. Again were really proud and also excited about the interactions we have made with Xencor and also with other companies regarding new and exciting combination programs including CD20CD3 assets. The reason we started actually with Xencor was that we know Xencor very well we have a very good and long standing and trustworthy relationship. And were now in the process of evaluating other potential combination partners. And we take this one step at a time a basket trial would be probably difficult because the other agents that you have mentioned are not yet approved. Thats why we will probably look at collaboration agreements with other companies if the opportunities arise.,MOR,1.0,1.0,Positive
Thanks Malte. Okay with regard to your question on milestones for Tafa recall when we did this deal it included a large upfront along with the eligibility of 1.1 billion for regulatory and commercial milestones. And I just called out two that are not included of that 1.1 billion. To the extent that we enter a year and a milestone is significant for that year we could talk about these because obviously it would be material to our company in that year but just wanting to respect the confidentiality of our agreement with our partner Im going to have to leave the details for the appropriate time. But I hope by clarifying the physician on the potential two catalysts this year it kind of helps you with your modeling.,MOR,0.8421730995178223,0.6843460108912056,Positive

The next question is by Vineet Agrawal from Citibank. Your line is open now sir.,MOR,0.9245221614837646,0.8490442329908805,Positive
Yes hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Three please. So first is the clarification on OpEx. So I think on slide 16 we can see that the OpEx of 309.7 million for 2020 includes COGS of about 9 million but youre saying that is excluded from 2021 guidance. So just wanted to confirm if youre changing the way you define OpEx and then second on RD Incyte has disclosed 88 million costs related to Monjuvi development for 2020. And obviously thats the 55 share but is it for fullyear or its from the date the deal got completed that is sometime in March. And the last question is on your last slide you didnt include the Xencor royalty if you could just clarify where it sits within the Monjuvi PL,MOR,0.999119520187378,0.9982390393251417,Positive
Sure. So this is Sung yes thats a very astute observation on OpEx. So the classical definition of that Ill just define OpEx with its RD expense and SGA expense. And I provided separate color on cost of goods sold or gross margin I should say with regard to Monjuvi. So its separated. So I can confirm that. OpEx again does not include any elements of cost of goods sold or cost of sales. Okay with regard to your question on the Tafa RD I think you were talking about reimbursement the 5545 split where we pick up 45 of the development expenses and Incyte balance. Ill have to doublecheck this but I believe this formula applies retroactively to a time thats before the effective date of the agreement. But Id like to be able to verify that and followup with you. And then your last question with regard to the Xencor royalties. And please correct me if I got the incorrect understanding. But basically there are royalties due to Xencor on worldwide sales. However with regard to U.S. Monjuvi sales the Xencor royalties factored into the profit share okay ExU.S. MorphoSys is responsible for paying the royalty to Xencor from the royalties that we received from Incyte.,MOR,0.9998632669448853,0.999726533726772,Positive
All right yes I mean so okay yes okay fair enough. Thats it. Thanks.,MOR,0.9998360872268676,0.9996721742583357,Positive
The next question is by Etzer Darout from Guggenheim Securities.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi this is Paul on for Etzer. Thanks for taking our questions. On Felzartamab I wanted to ask about the rationale for the DOSING schedule as youre investigating in the new place trial and sort of how you anticipate the results of this study and place altogether informing thinking about next development steps and indiscernible in the property. And also just a clarifying question will be MPLACE data most likely be at a medical meeting or more of a company belief Thanks.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Yes the development strategy of conducting scheduling finding or defining studies in parallel to the sort of proof of concept study is actually quite normal in the autoimmune development worlds. So we are on purpose doing this in parallel so that we not only get confidence on the activity of this program in a significant autoimmune indication but at the same time develop the best schedule going forward. And as its public information you can see it in 10 for 5. So were comparing two different schedules differing by the amount of different doses over time and that help guide us to provide actually the best and most convenient treatment schedule for patients.,MOR,0.9999992847442628,0.999998569487673,Positive
With respect to your second question of when and how we were communicating the data we havent really made up our minds. I think it depends a bit on how fast we progress on looking at the data cleaning them as you know so we will do this as quickly as we can. We expect to have data on the firsthalf of this year but again then it depends a little bit on what the sequence and cadence is also meetings but we will share this as soon as we can.,MOR,0.9978734254837036,0.9957468484323313,Positive

Hi thank you for taking my questions. I have three I think you can help. The first one is on Tafa I guess can you comment on Tafas overall tick up kind of how physicians use it in the secondline or later. And also have you seen any physicians using the Tafa post CART failures Thats what weve heard if people are trying or using that any color would be helpful there Secondly a quick followup on felzartamab I guess autoimmune is a big indication class. Would you be interested in finding a partnership there And third is the clarification on the financials I recalled there are significant portion of upfront payment from each site has not been recognized. I guess how would that be recognizing income statement would be recognized in 2021 Thank you.,MOR,0.9964534044265748,0.9929068046252758,Positive
JeanPaul Kress,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi this is JeanPaul. I answered your question on salsa and the potential partnership indiscernible question on Monjuvi and then certainly we close on the financial question. So felzartamab we have the opportunity now to really strengthen and build our own portfolio coming out of this loan years of licensing of partner business and the intent is to obviously retain the economics we set up felzartamab we have the whole economics all the asset but we might establish a commercial partnership in the future depending on the indications. Imagine we needed to tackle a legit target or universe with this first indication we might. We might decide to partner with either company with a presence in ecology. Nothing is decided but we havethe optionality and we have the complete control on the asset.,MOR,0.9690916538238524,0.938183270802063,Positive
Roland please indiscernible and the question on secondline indiscernible.,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. On Monjuvi realworld usage as you would expect in any launch in hematology there are physicians that are having an initial trial of the medicine for later line the last line patients that have run out of options. Weve seen this happening. Having said that over these last months we are very encouraged pleased with the uptake that we see in secondline where we are the only approved regimen for patients and especially in the community setting that offers a very attractive opportunity for patients and for healthcare professional. So were very pleased with what were seeing in terms of the transition going into secondline where we also expect treatment durations to be longer in line with the longterm data that we are sharing. As for the usage before and after CART Ph I think that Malte perhaps give us a bit more color and share with more color there.,MOR,0.969783365726471,0.9395666954318853,Positive
Yes thanks Roland. So we actually see both. We actually see Monjuvi used before and after CART treatment which I think also make sense from a scientific and clinical data perspective. We have  we are in the process of also sharing data regarding the CD19 expression. So that we can gain confidence inside and also outside that the CD19 target actually remains intact upon longerterm treatment with Monjuvi. So thats a very important information but in the real words sketching as you asked we are actually quite contend and also excited thats doctors use Monjuvi before and also after CART treatment.,MOR,0.999854326248169,0.9997086523226812,Positive
Okay. And I think you had a question on the recognition of milestones from Incyte indiscernible treatment. Generally these milestones are recognized when theyre earned and theyre paid in a lump sum generally speaking. So I dont see anything unique about these milestone so hopefully that answers your question.,MOR,0.9986931681632996,0.9973863347687333,Positive

Yes. Hi its Daniel indiscernible. Thanks for taking my question. One further clarification question on the guidance and so is with any Monjuvi revenue coming out of Europe also in form as a loyalty included in this guidance at all. And that would be my first question. And the second question is on Monjuvi market launch in U.S. Is it fair to assume that I interpret your comments with regards to the impact of the Corona as well as the winter storms in U.S. that that March April maybe also May might also be more complicated quarters in terms of the launch. And thats my second question. And my last question on Tremfya royalties and then the moderate yearonyear growth you have included in your guidance for 2021. And the product was also approved in Europe for psoriatic arthritis. Is that now a more normal growth rate or the status of that product or why is that not stronger Thank you.,MOR,0.9999995827674866,0.9999991655344758,Positive
JeanPaul Kress,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Daniel. Ill take question two on the Monjuvi launch. Look as we said several times during the COVID at early days and we launched in the middle of the pandemic. So weve focusing on execution on the launch but I mean bearing in mind that we are so focused also on and looking the longterm potential of Monjuvi. And you wanted a couple of examples this morning with indiscernible. We have so many opportunities with the pipeline Monjuvi as a backbone Monjuvi as a indiscernible product felzartamab earlier RD and obviously potential external of proximity. So Ill encourage you to stay tune and hang with us as were navigating the context but it doesnt affect the longterm perspective Monjuvi in our opinion.,MOR,0.997646152973175,0.995292303140344,Positive
Now Ill pass to Sung for the question on the guidance.,MOR,0.1870052218437194,-0.6259905254784379,Negative
Right. So I think your first question was have we baked in any royalty revenue from potential EU sales of Monjuvi and the answer is simply is no. Obviously when that event happens well have greater certainty. Your other question was with regard to Tremfya growth and I just referring slide 16 where weve characterized it as we expect moderate growth. And I think your question is why not more. Well simply I think definitions of moderate vary but certainly this is not something we want to be aggressive on because we receive as much information as you do with regard to Tremfya sales up there. And obviously in 2020 it did 1.3 billion so its blockbuster status. The year before 1 billion and it seems like with the amount of studies our partner is conducting and the footprint expansion for Tremfya this continues to have a runway. But its certainly is not something we have tremendous visibility into. And again we do not receive any detailed forecast from our partner. And we are working with as much information that is available to the public. And this is not something that the company needs to be super aggressive on.,MOR,0.999860405921936,0.999720811677463,Positive

Hi thanks for taking the question. Just on the MPLACE study in this first data readout we get would we get Proteinuria data as well as immunological response And if we do can you help us benchmark the kind of response there we look for Is there anything thats relevant from studies for example with toxin Ph or steroids that you point us to as a benchmark for Proteinuria response And then followup JeanPaul just at the beginning of our prepared comments you talked about bispecific is important to the longterm strategy. Obviously you had partnership with Xencor but you maybe just talk about your internal plans for bispecific development Thanks.,MOR,0.9998509287834167,0.9997018573891268,Positive
JeanPaul Kress,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Jason. Actually I will let Malte answer the two parts of the  the two questions.,MOR,0.9899063110351562,0.9798126100376905,Positive
So let me start with the first question on MPLACE. Yes we are of course monitoring the autoantibody titers in conjunction with Proteinuria data. And as you may know the Proteinuria data come roughly six to nine months after you see the first drop in autoantibody titers thats just by normal process of how kidney reacts to the disappearance of the pathogenic autoantibody. So thats why we hope to have as many data for Proteinuria as possible. But we certainly have immunological data and for proportion of patients for sure are supported by Proteinuria data. With respect to the comparison or benchmarking too we took them up thats actually quite difficult to make sort of a cross product comparison because recall that in our trail  in the MPLACE trial a significant focus is on patients who would have almost zero probability to respond to tafasitamab because they have such high autoantibody titer. So thats a difficult situation to give a good benchmarking comparison. But I think with respect to the anecdotal information we receive from other antiCD38 antibodies in similar diseases and with respect to what we have seen in our multiple myeloma studies regarding autoantibody production antibody production we are really confident and optimistic that we actually score extremely high and have a very competitive product.,MOR,0.9999810457229614,0.9999620914233276,Positive
JeanPaul Kress,MOR,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And Jason for your third question on bispecific we have a series of  Ill take that first. We have a series of candidates actually in our research pipeline bispecific  novel generation of bispecific the Hemibody technology on Phase Ph and the CyCAT platform. So yes we are obviously looking at what makes sense here trying to overcome the current challenges of bispecific especially in terms of safety and tolerability.,MOR,0.9740030765533448,0.9480061221159235,Positive

Thank you operator. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results call. Joining me today from the management team of KindredBio are Wendy Wee our CFO and Katja Buhrer our VP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations.,KIN,0.9999867081642152,0.9999734163125853,Positive
We are thrilled with our progress in the fourth quarter and in 2020 in general. We made excellent headway across our pipeline including the initiation of the pivotal study for tirnovetmab and positive results on our inflammatory bowel disease program.,KIN,0.9890017509460448,0.9780034887811473,Positive
We also signed a partnership agreement with Elanco for our parvovirus antibody and expanded our manufacturing agreement with Vaxart. The successes in 2020 have set us up well for 2021 and we expect this year to be a better year for KindredBio.,KIN,0.9377761483192444,0.8755522224618331,Positive
Let me start with an update on our dermatitis franchise. We initiated the pivotal study for tirnovetmab in December of last year. Its too soon to tell how quickly it will enroll and our expectation that the study will take 12 to 18 months to complete hasnt changed. This is one of our flagship product candidates. And given that the canine dermatitis market has grown to nearly 1 billion a year we would expect tirnovetmab to be extremely successful.,KIN,0.9974079132080078,0.9948158233260056,Positive
In addition we are advancing our other candidates for dermatitis nicely including our IL4 receptor antibody. As a reminder IL4 our antibody targets the underlying disease itself instead of just the symptoms. So it could potentially have significant advantages over certain available therapies.,KIN,0.8847869634628296,0.7695737895809349,Positive
We believe we have one of the broadest and most advanced dermatitis pipelines in the industry including several molecules that have not had been disclosed. We have already incorporated our Half Life Extension technology into our dermatitis pipeline and think longacting molecules have the potential to be bestinclass and possibly market leaders.,KIN,0.9961971640586852,0.992394323584034,Positive
With the exception of the current incumbent we estimate that we are ahead of our competition in this field and we expect to be next to market with a molecule for this indication. So were very excited about our highly promising dermatitis pipeline.,KIN,0.992128849029541,0.9842576886759333,Positive
Turning to the parvovirus program we have reported compelling results from the prophylaxis pivotal study. The treatment pivotal study has been delayed longer than expected but we expect results in the near future. We believe that this antibody has the potential to revolutionize the care of dogs and puppies with this devastating condition. Theres a lot of excitement both within the company and outside about this program which offers hope for what is a terrible and currently untreatable disease.,KIN,0.0117130875587463,-0.9765750030130167,Negative
Were very excited about our partnership with Elanco which has one of the best commercial organizations in the industry. The terms of the partnership are very favorable with milestones totaling over 100 million as we previously announced. We also read out the results for the inflammatory bowel disease program at the end of last year and the results were impressive.,KIN,0.9972254633903505,0.9944509234731935,Positive
Complete remission was achieved in 75 of the TNF antibody group compared to 17 in the placebo group. At day seven the first post dose visits 75 of the treated dogs showed greater than 35 reduction in disease score compared to only 17 in the placebo group. Furthermore 50 of the treated dogs achieved and maintain 100 reduction of disease score from baseline throughout all posts dose visits whereas none of the placebo group achieved the same result,KIN,0.9114041328430176,0.8228081600714683,Positive
IBD and related disorders are very common affecting over 5 of dogs. The market has many similarities to the atopic dermatitis market before modern treatments are approved including notable impact on the owners quality of life. We think it could rival the atopic dermatitis market in size. We have an exciting year ahead of us as we continue to advance our program including multiple major readouts and potential approval of parvovirus.,KIN,0.9855879545211792,0.9711758918618512,Positive
Turning to financials which Wendy will discuss in more detail were pleased with the royalty revenue which reflects the great work that our partner is doing. Dechra has done a terrific job of growing the market. And it is clear we partnered with the right company. In addition were also pleased with the revenue were generating from our contract manufacturing business.,KIN,0.9999520778656006,0.9999041556740735,Positive
The work is coming along well on our Vaxart partnership and with the expansion of that partnership we expect to realize about 20.5 million of revenue. We have also been awarded a contract from the National Cancer Institute for manufacture of a human papillomavirus vaccine which further validates our manufacturing capabilities. In order to qualify for contracts like this the companies must undergo and pass a very rigorous evaluation process.,KIN,0.9840171337127686,0.9680342483724644,Positive
As you know we have worldclass manufacturing plants and personnel. This gives us a major competitive advantage and presents an opportunity to bring in nondilutive capital for contract manufacturing. At the same time our number one focus remains executing on our very attractive pipeline.,KIN,0.9894657135009766,0.9789314144440975,Positive
We continue to be judicious with our spending we were able to maintain our OpEx to approximately 10 million in Q4 and expect this level to remain fairly steady in 2021. The net takeaways are that we operate in a resilient and growing industry.,KIN,0.7519066333770752,0.5038129710036343,Positive

Turning to our financials for the fourth quarter we reported a net loss of 10.9 million or 0.28 per share compared to a net loss of 15.7 million or 0.40 per share for the same period in 2019. For the full year the net  loss was 21.8 million or 0.55 per share as compared to a net loss of 61.4 million or 1.59 per share in 2019.

Total revenues were 1 million for the quarter versus 1.4 million in the year ago period. Full year revenues were 42.2 million compared to 4.3 million in 2019. Here again the biggest component of the variance in the full year result was due to 38.7 million from the sale of Mirataz. Substantially all of the 878000 in product revenues for the year 2020 were for Mirataz.,KIN,0.1626293361186981,-0.6747423259868182,Negative
We recorded royalty revenue of 122000 in the fourth quarter and 535000 for the year.

As we have noted in prior quarters the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects the inclusion of Kansas facility expenditures in RD as it began to manufacture clinical trial material partially offset by lower payroll and related costs consistent with the decision to discontinue small molecule development in favor of biologics programs.,KIN,0.1832417547702789,-0.633517464111724,Negative
Prior to 2020 construction and commissioning expenditures associated with the Kansas facility have been categorized as general and administrative expenses. Stockbased compensation expense and RD was 1.9 million in 2020 versus 1.8 million in the prior year.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
SGA expenses totaled 3.3 million for the fourth quarter versus 9.6 million for the same period in 2019. For 2020 SGA expenses were 22 million compared to 37.9 million in the prior year. The 15.9 million yearoveryear decrease is the result of the recategorization of the Kansas plant expenditures as research and development expenses. And lower payroll and related expenses as a result of the elimination of KindredBios companion animals sales force.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Stockbased compensation expense was 5.7 million in 2020 versus 5.5 million in the prior year. In connection with the prioritization of KindredBios late stage programs and associated workforce reduction we recorded a restructuring charge of 4.2 million in 2020. We maintain a healthy cash balance providing us with the runway to reach key milestones on our late stage programs.,KIN,0.1194253265857696,-0.7611503965558987,Negative
As of December 31 2020 we had 59 9 million in cash cash equivalents and investments compared to 73.5 million at December 31 2019. Net cash used in operating activities in 2020 was approximately 9.9 million reflecting payment received for the Mirataz asset sale. We also invested approximately 3.6 million in capital expenditures for the purchase of lab and manufacturing equipment for the Kansas facility.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
With respect to spending in 2021 we continue to be judicious with our spend and expect quarterly operating expenditures to remain broadly stable on a sequential basis. We anticipate operating expenses to range between 41 million to 43 million. We also plan to invest approximately 3 billion in capital expenditures on lab and manufacturing equipment for our biologics programs in 2021.,KIN,0.8732442855834961,0.7464884200623154,Positive
We believe our existing cash cash equivalents and investments remaining proceeds from the Mirataz sale revenue from contract manufacturing and revenues in the form of royalties and partner licensing will be sufficient to fund current operating plan until early 2023.,KIN,0.7994793653488159,0.5989584916582653,Positive
In closing we look forward to important pipeline catalyst in the year ahead and have the necessary cash one way and RD expertise to realize the value of our attractive late stage programs. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the next quarter.,KIN,0.9833346009254456,0.9666691819841755,Positive
I will now turn the call back over to Richard.,KIN,0.8493170142173767,0.6986338488065296,Positive
Thank you Wendy. Operator we are ready for QA.,KIN,0.9748860001564026,0.9497719703745666,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Your question please.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Great thanks guys. Good afternoon maybe two or three from me but Wendy Ill start with sort of a guidance the fully funded guidance until early 2023 is better than the prior. I think the language was mid 2022 the OpEx assumption seemingly did not change clearly youve had several positive announcement over the past few months with parvo Elanco in contract manufacturing,KIN,1.0,1.0,Positive
But can you detail on what looks like maybe nine you know three additional quarters or nine additional months of the company being fully funded And maybe its from that Vaxart. I thought Richard you might have given a 20 some odd million dollar number there but maybe Wendy if you could provide the details that would be very helpful,KIN,0.9981766939163208,0.99635338565909,Positive
Sure its naturally from our Vaxart revenue and the partnership with Elanco. And also we have drawn down on a small portion of our ATM so that extended out cash runway.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay and Im trying to figure that you did provide for Vaxart just to be clear is that something that will come on board in the next 12 to 24 months or was that you know that revenue figure could extend well beyond 2023 Im just trying to get the timeframe for the 20 some odd million that you attributed to Vaxart,KIN,0.0738706886768341,-0.8522597266791622,Negative
Yes the 20.5 million is really to be recognized in the year 2021. That is our contract with Vaxart.,KIN,0.8845189809799194,0.7690378242956544,Positive
Okay great thats great to hear. And then you know were attribute to pivot for the business call it IL31 you were very clear and look we just started enrolling it hasnt changed its 12 to 18 months. But maybe if you could furnish us with some thoughts on the updates that you from a company perspective plan to provide along the way as we think about 2021. What should we hear from Kindred Biosciences in terms of the timeline for IL31 And how youre going to handle that with the street,KIN,0.9933979511260986,0.986795894381937,Positive
Yes sure. I think in another quarter or so well have enough enrollment information that we could probably  we find that guidance. So as we get two three more months of enrollment under our belt it should become clear which way the enrollment is going.,KIN,0.9724341630935668,0.9448682933260757,Positive
Okay. And last one from me and then Ill followup offline. I believe Richard when you were talking about IBD you mentioned increased conviction that the market size could maybe even be as big as atopic derm. I mean atopic derm is obviously one of the  the bigger success stories that weve had in the companion animal market. Can you talk to what led you down that path and mentioned that And why the increase conviction if you would that IBD could be such a material blockbuster Thank you.,KIN,0.9987831115722656,0.9975662216938863,Positive
Absolutely so obviously weve been talking to additional veterinarians and customers. And as weve been analyzed the data weve realized how impressive the data is. So if you look at the market so atopic dermatitis is about  affects about 10 of dogs inflammatory bowel disease and diseases that are sort of in that similar category affects at least 5 or probably more than 5 of the dog.,KIN,0.0216354727745056,-0.9567302207530861,Negative
We think the impact on the quality of life is actually more significant for inflammatory bowel disease because the dog is basically making a mess on the carpet. And there are a lot of parallels to the atopic dermatitis market. Right now the mainstay is steroids which is cheap but has a lot of side effects including making the dog pee on the carpet and they become incontinent.,KIN,0.0779186487197876,-0.8441638017677079,Negative
And just like the atopic dermatitis market before the current therapies were launched the veterinarians and owners had to make do with therapies that were either not effective or has a lot of side effects the exact same situation in the case in IBD. So if we bring out a drug that has similar well that works quickly that works well.,KIN,0.8675658106803894,0.7351314634868285,Positive
And its very safe and we think that this could be another example of a market that goes from few 10s of millions of dollars to hundreds of million dollars very rapidly.,KIN,0.9416890740394592,0.8833780785668364,Positive
And our next question comes from the line of Brooks ONeil from Lake Street Capital. Your question please.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Brooks ONeil,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Im curious Richard if you would mind talking just a little bit about your sort of philosophy as it relates to some of these next generations next in the product line in the pipeline products in terms of partnering Are you thinking A that you want to pursue partnerships for these additional indications are you thinking its more likely that you would continue to work with Elanco or do you think it might make sense to work with a variety of potential partners as you move those products forward,KIN,0.9984322190284728,0.9968644361880039,Positive
Yes so Elanco has been a great partner so far. Were working really well with them. So I could certainly envision partnering on other products with them. We do plan on partnering most of our products. And depending on the product we may partner earlier or later I think some products the value is so apparent early in the development that we could get attractive economics for those some of the other ones we may need to wait a little longer.,KIN,0.9994864463806152,0.9989728921490264,Positive
So it will be on a casebycase basis as to when we partner to depend on when we think we can get the best economics. Now I think what youre alluding to is do we plan on having a multiproduct partnership with other companies. We havent approach about partnerships like that. Right now we are focused on individual products but certainly it all depends on the terms. So we wouldnt rule that out.,KIN,0.9858525395393372,0.9717050622135772,Positive
Brooks ONeil,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay great. Thank you very much for that color. I was hoping Wendy might just give any color she would offer with regard to the pattern of spending  the quarterly pattern of spending that you might anticipate for 2021,KIN,0.99736225605011,0.9947245089557823,Positive
Well we do expect spending to be pretty consistent typically the first quarter is generally higher than other quarters. But we do expect it to be pretty consistent.,KIN,0.9999324083328248,0.9998648165850741,Positive
Brooks ONeil,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Right you dont see you dont see spending on any of these trials bumping up spending in any particular quarter at least from where you sit right now,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
While we do expect parvovirus trial to be completed thats why I mentioned you know were expecting first quarter spending to be slightly higher.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Brooks ONeil,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes.,KIN,0.7864110469818115,0.5728218393455979,Positive
But than other quarters but in general the guidances 41 million to 43 million spending for the year.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Brooks ONeil,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay got that thats great. And then last from me Im just curious as you guys think about the sources of nondilutive financing obviously Jon asked you about the cash availability and the positive developments youve seen there. But as you think about nondilutive financing what do you see as your biggest opportunities in the next year or so,KIN,0.9998955130577089,0.9997910259908596,Positive
Maybe Ill start the answer and Wendy feel free to add to it. Certainly we expect additional revenues from partnerships both milestones and royalties. We expect to continue to build our contract manufacturing business which as I said is not our primary line of work. But right now were in the fortunate situation that theres a lot of demand for biologics. So and that between those two we should be getting some additional funding you want to add to that Wendy,KIN,0.9898229241371156,0.979645836142204,Positive
Though you basically identified the main areas.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Brooks ONeil,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Great and just one sort of followup to that would you anticipate some of your contract manufacturing opportunities to be petrelated biologics or do you are you pretty open minded about what the opportunities might be and that to take advantage of your capacity,KIN,0.9988635778427124,0.9977271543307031,Positive
Yes we definitely expect to have opportunities for pet biologics. In fact as we have right of refusal for two of Elancos products.,KIN,0.9928102493286132,0.9856204900863705,Positive
Brooks ONeil,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In addition the other companies are pursuing biologics manufacturing and theres some startups looking at monoclonal in the veterinary space. Of course there are many years behind us. We are very well positioned to manufacture biologics for veterinary companies. We have the plants. Weve built up expertise in manufacturing for USDA. And thats different than manufacturing for FDA or EMA.,KIN,0.9928469657897948,0.9856939230525033,Positive
So we think we will probably be one of the partners of choice for manufacturing. In addition we have potential customers for the human side. And certainly we can do either one. So I think well see a mix of both.,KIN,0.9962818622589112,0.9925637200854542,Positive
Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Folkes from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi thanks for taking my question and congratulations on all the progress during year. Maybe just one from me on KIND030 and but the indication theyre being pursued the prophylactic and therapeutic. If the therapeutic pivotal efficacy is successful when you could elaborate on their regulatory strategy there is this a label expansion post approval of the prophylactic an amendment to the current submission or completely different filing altogether Thank you.,KIN,1.0,1.0,Positive
Sure. If the treatment study is not positive for some reason and obviously theres always some risk whenever youre doing clinical studies. We would launch with the prophylaxis indication or Elanco would. And the advantage of this molecule is that its the same presentation its same bio which means that veterinarians would be free to use the drug for either indication. We would follow that up with a second approval.,KIN,0.1766881942749023,-0.6466245929149348,Negative
Because even if for some reason one is trouble with the study we would certainly repeat it because we know the molecule works for treatment. So I would anticipate the sales would still be quite attractive because veterinarians most likely use the drug for both indications obviously we would not be promoting for an unapproved use. So I think under that scenario there would be some impact. But the impact would not be  may not be as great as you might otherwise think on revenues.,KIN,0.9879878759384156,0.9759757375572551,Positive
Thanks. And Richard maybe just if you are successful in the therapeutic indication so what is the filing strategy just given that youve initiated the prophylactic filing Are they two separate filings altogether or how should we think about sort of the timing of therapy youre being able to promote therapeutic  indication,KIN,0.9995508193969728,0.9991016382584803,Positive
Yes the clinical filing would be separate. But the manufacturing part of the filing would be shared between the two. And manufacturing right now is the rate limiting factor. So even with the delay in the treatment pivotal we dont anticipate the approval date will be affected. Because the part that we think is going to be the regular limiting factor is the speed at which USDA is able to test the manufacturing samples we send them.,KIN,0.2899185121059418,-0.420163822271718,Negative
So USDA takes the bios from your manufacturing run and they run their own tests on those samples. And from what weve heard theres a delay its taking them longer than it normally does because theyre short staffed most likely due to COVID.,KIN,0.1803236901760101,-0.6393535967788677,Negative
Operator Instructions Our next question comes in a line of RK from H.C. Wainwright. Your question please.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you and good afternoon Richard and Wendy.,KIN,0.9948012828826904,0.9896025595680233,Positive
Good afternoon.,KIN,0.9969915747642516,0.9939831459421786,Positive
Yes just like  just as you explained a little bit about the revenue run from Vaxart. Like to understand the contact under the prevent program for the IDIQ. How long is this contact for And any color as to how we would see that  revenue run rate from the NCI,KIN,0.9232707023620604,0.8465413132556157,Positive
Sure so this is part of large overarching program that NCI has that we announced previously that we were one of the three qualified vendors for this program. So the contract that we were awarded the task order has couple of different components. So it could be under a 1 million to over 1 million for this first portion. So thats why we havent put out the exact numbers because its variable to have. They have an option for the second part of the contract.,KIN,0.0763934850692749,-0.8472141308868711,Negative
We believe that this is the first of multiple contracts that we are likely to be awarded under this overarching program. So right now we cant predict because obviously it depends on which additional contracts we get awarded.,KIN,0.970780611038208,0.9415611872441692,Positive
Thank you. And then regarding Mirataz under Dechra what do you think of  or what is your feeling regarding how its being commercialized and also just so that we can understand the flow of revenue to the royalties from that product,KIN,0.9995436668395996,0.9990873331352075,Positive
Sure Ill start it off. And then Ill have Katja to add to what Im saying because shes in charge of managing the partnerships. Ill start by saying weve been very very happy with how Dechra is handling our product its a high priority for them. They really like the product.,KIN,0.9980956315994264,0.9961912609286674,Positive
Theyre getting really good feedback and theyre able to leverage the rest of their portfolio to get adoption. So were seeing a steady upward trend in the move out. But Katja do you want to speak to that a little bit,KIN,0.8342447280883789,0.6684892585809581,Positive
Sure so they realized strong growth in U.S. Mirataz sales  the launch of the product in April 2020 and have achieved a near 50 increase in monthly sales to U.S. clinics. So in the fourth quarter the sales to distributors were lower on quarteroverquarter but sales from distributors to veterinary clinics increased versus the third quarter. Theyve also since launched in the EU and U.K.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And so we think well see an acceleration of the sales trajectory going forward. So were very pleased with the results. Weve seen that to date and we think that we have a strong track record currently and well see more positive news to come there.,KIN,0.9696134328842164,0.9392268295448005,Positive
Thank you. Thank you all for taking my questions.,KIN,0.9973267912864684,0.9946535793862217,Positive
Sure.,KIN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

With that Id like to turn the call over to Manny Hilario. Manny,STKS,0.9797705411911012,0.9595410582667938,Positive
Thank you Tyler and hello everyone. We hope that everyone has stayed safe and healthy during these extraordinary times and appreciate your continued interest in The ONE Group.,STKS,0.9909016489982604,0.9818032871504347,Positive
I would like to offer some brief thoughts on our fourth quarter results but more importantly discuss where the business has been since the beginning of the year as that recovery continues to strengthen.,STKS,0.823003351688385,0.6460064923801974,Positive
Finally I will discuss our nearterm development plans. It was March 15 2020 when Ohios Governor ordered all restaurants to close their dining rooms and bars and within a week most states followed suite. It has been a journey since then for our industry and for our company. Im pleased to launch this conference call by reporting that so far for the first quarter through March 14 2021 our consolidated comparable sales on a twoyear basis have increased 0.5 albeit we are still limited by many restrictions.,STKS,0.9945238828659058,0.9890477592037672,Positive
We are pleased with a strong momentum and feel hopeful for the future as governmental capacity restrictions have begun to further relax in many of our key markets California Nevada Minnesota Nashville. For example starting on March 15 2021 Las Vegas is changing to 50 capacity. To put it in perspective with our ph Las Vegas for the first quarter through March 14 2120 our consolidated comparable sales on a twoyear basis increased 7.1.,STKS,0.9999841451644896,0.9999682903100788,Positive
As we discussed in our last conference call we began the fourth quarter with encouraging trends in October as exhibited by positive comparable sales across both STK and Kona Grill resulting in a consolidated increase of 4.2 for the month. This was largely a result of us reaching our highest indoor dining capacity since the pandemic began of 51.,STKS,0.9213011264801024,0.8426021591437809,Positive
However as dining restrictions were reinstated over the course of the fourth quarter comparable sales trends naturally soften resulting in an 18.4 decrease in November and a 26.4 decrease in December at the consolidated level.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Additionally in November and December we typically have a very large events business across our restaurants. Due to COVID restrictions we were unable to host large events in the quarter. Still we were very pleased with our teams for doing such a great job of managing through the decreased dining capacity and comparable sales headwinds while containing costs.,STKS,0.9016568064689636,0.803313495703635,Positive
It is also worth mentioning that takeout and delivery comprised approximately 50 of sales during the fourth quarter which has almost tripled compared to the first quarter of 2020. We attribute the success to our investments in technology which has enabled our guests to order for curbside pickup or delivery from nine separate delivery partners.,STKS,0.9463376998901368,0.8926753358097888,Positive
To help drive takeout sales we have adapted our menus particularly STK to have more transportable items that work in a takeout environment. This has certainly gone a long way towards elevating this channel and we are confident that offpremises sale will remain a meaningful and high margin layer of the business going forward even as we welcome more and more guests back into the dining rooms.,STKS,0.2324293553829193,-0.535142204250219,Negative
There is no denying that guests are increasingly eager to return to normal life to the extent possible and for many that includes visiting full service restaurants for a great night out.,STKS,0.9916571378707886,0.9833142657961045,Positive
The fine dining experience that we offer is particularly attractive to so many people because its really a differentiated fun and vibrant experience compared to other higher end steak houses and upscale casual restaurants.,STKS,0.9910317659378052,0.9820635211846358,Positive
We firmly believe that we are the leader in this highly differentiated category and that our offer goes beyond great food and a unique bar cocktail program It includes so much more an exceptional service program complemented by great energy and great ambience that results in an unmatched and unforgettable dining experience.,STKS,0.9999660849571228,0.9999321698738157,Positive
Moving on one of the biggest cost advantages of our business is our emphasis on digital marketing relative to our peers. We have over 1.3 million people in our Friends with Benefits database and well be enhancing our loyalty program later this year merging into a new program that well be calling the VIBE Society. We also have other digital assets across Facebook Instagram and LinkedIn that have enabled us to stay on top of mind with our guests.,STKS,0.9995837211608888,0.9991674418255343,Positive
And we never went dark even in the worst of the pandemic rather we have always made sure that our guests knew that we were out there and eager to serve them whether through delivery or takeout or even within our restaurants if possible.,STKS,0.1360915899276733,-0.7278178500043453,Negative
Just as an example we sold a tremendous amount of Turkey on Thanksgiving this past year selling more Turkey through checkout and inperson dining than we ever had before. And the bigger picture this was frankly a result of our commitment to stay true to our core business model of owning the holidays.,STKS,0.958827257156372,0.9176544652309804,Positive
Looking at Kona growth specifically the brand generated an 8.6 increase in comparable sales in October but trailed off in November and December as capacity restrictions were reinstated. Still for the full quarter comparable sales declined only 8 which exceeded most other polished casual dining chains. We attribute throughout this outperformance of at Kona Grill to our strategies implemented since the acquisition.,STKS,0.2064774930477142,-0.5870459598576784,Negative
Specifically our numerous sales drivers including the launch of focused menus the addition of craveable food offerings launching a revived bar and patio program featuring more active music and aggressive and sustained marketing activities that leverage our social media capabilities.,STKS,0.98950457572937,0.9790091389472118,Positive
Our topline initiatives have also been complemented by better restaurant execution of the guest experience. Lastly our Kona Grill suburban footprint has been a competitive advantage particularly in the current environment.,STKS,0.9970602989196776,0.9941205943349565,Positive
Now some additional comments on 2021. We are encouraged that our sales trends have improved since the onset of the New Year. Our dining capacity rose to 41 in January which marked an improvement from December and correspondingly our January consolidated comparable sales declined 13.3.,STKS,0.954469919204712,0.9089397841333058,Positive
For STK comparable sales decreased 23.2 while at Kona Grill comparable sales decreased only 1.4. February was even stronger with a mere 1.1 decrease in consolidated comparable sales and an increase in indoor dining capacity to 46.,STKS,0.8938160538673401,0.7876319811534769,Positive
STK decreased 1.7 and Kona Grill decreased 0.3. And finally from March 1st through the 14th a 24 increase in consolidated comparable sales and increase in indoor dining capacity to over 50.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Clearly our guests want to dine with us for all the reasons I have already identified and will do so as permitted by law. And when they choose to come into our restaurants we are providing them with the exceptional and unforgettable experiences that they crave.,STKS,0.9747735261917114,0.9495470223111047,Positive
As we look ahead our key focus is operational readiness for what we expect will be high volumes as COVID cases continue to decline as vaccines become more widely available and restrictions are lifted. Note that we have yet to open our Events Private Dining business but well do so when the time is ready.,STKS,0.9745160341262816,0.9490320378732904,Positive
From a development standpoint we opened managed STK restaurant in Scottsdale Arizona in January. The restaurant is off to an incredible start averaging 180000 in sales volume per week which is a very encouraging beginning for our newest location.,STKS,0.9620753526687622,0.9241506601277949,Positive
Recall that for restaurants and venues that are managed or licensed we typically generate management fees based on topline revenues and incentive fee revenue based on a percentage of the locations net profits.,STKS,0.190529316663742,-0.6189423316373419,Negative
As of today there are currently four STKs and three managed FB other brand restaurants under construction. And between this year and next year we intend to open 13 new venues. In addition we are receiving a lot of inbound inquiries from current and prospective partners and we are carefully evaluating these opportunities on a casebycase basis.,STKS,0.9577255249023438,0.9154509994095561,Positive
Longer term we have identified over 75 additional major metropolitan areas across the globe where we could grow our STK brand to 200 restaurants over the foreseeable future.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
To conclude our team has certainly proven our resiliency during these trying times and we are doing a fantastic job welcoming guests back into our restaurants for a great VIBE dining experience.,STKS,0.9797722101211548,0.9595443961288905,Positive
Now Ill turn the call back to Tyler.,STKS,0.0357815623283386,-0.9284380247819571,Negative
Thank you Manny and thank you for joining us on the call today. We expect that we will be filing our 2020 Form 10K in the near future. I will now provide you an update on current sales performance.,STKS,0.9992386102676392,0.9984772196276306,Positive
Domestic consolidated comparable sales declined 14.8 for the fourth quarter of 2020. For STK comparable sales decreased 20.7 and for Kona Grill comparable sales decreased 8.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
As Manny commented sales sequentially decelerated throughout the quarter for both STK and Kona Grill as a result of state mandated indoor dining closures. As cities began to reopen consolidated comparable sales for January February and March through the 14th continue to sequentially improve. Most importantly comparable sales yeartodate 2021 versus 2019 are now positive a reflection of consumer demand for VIBE dining.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Because of the impact of COVID19 we have decided to permanently consolidate all VIBE business into one location. We will closely monitor the progress of business conditions in that market and decide that we reopen a second location at a later time.,STKS,0.7983492016792297,0.5966981629718322,Positive
As a reminder due to these unprecedented market conditions and uncertainty surrounding the effects of the pandemic we cannot reasonably estimate when our business will return fully to normal operation and therefore suspended all financial guidance last March. We do however intend to provide further business updates if warranted by this evolving situation.,STKS,0.0106585323810577,-0.9786841146255223,Negative
I will now turn the call back to Manny.,STKS,0.1541296243667602,-0.6917417596231459,Negative
Thank you Tyler and thank you all for your time today. We are very encouraged by our results in the fourth quarter and especially by the positive trend so far in 2021. We are in a better position now than we were just a few months ago and this is due to the efforts of our exceptional team.,STKS,0.9997027516365052,0.9994055029186626,Positive
They have helped us to navigate through these trying times and are now positioning us for what we believe is yet to come a recovery characterized by strong demand for a differentiated VIBE experience.,STKS,0.9614053964614868,0.9228107469145934,Positive
Our team is doing an exceptional job bringing our mission to live every day to be the best restaurant in every market where we operate by delivering exceptional and unforgettable guest experiences to every guest every time.

QuestionandAnswer Session,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
At this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions,STKS,0.7868310809135437,0.573661907709782,Positive
Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Meyers with Lake Street Capital Markets. You may proceed with your questions.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey guys thanks for taking my questions. First one for me. So the commentary that you gave in the press release on capacity and comps was pretty helpful so appreciate that. Just wanted to get some insight on do you guys think that January was the trough here and then how are you sort of thinking about the business for the rest of the year and kind of which one is seeing the better recovery that STK or the Kona Just kind of any sort of commentary on that would be helpful.,STKS,0.9998501539230348,0.9997003076674391,Positive
Great. Sure. So from what weve seen so far this year I would agree that January was what I considered to be a transitional month. I think that in January we did see the impact of pretty cold weather across the country and being in locations with only outdoor facilities was very challenging I would think. So I believe starting in February that we saw a little bit better weather patterns and also the lifting of restrictions.,STKS,0.9999866485595704,0.9999732971032247,Positive
So what weve seen in January February and March has been an ongoing pattern of the restrictions being lifted. We also have some additional lifting coming up for instance New York is shortly going to be at 50 which is a big market for us. We also have Vegas coming to 50 very soon. So I would say that were now on a more positive momentum going forward particularly as the restrictions continue to be lifted.,STKS,0.9113631844520568,0.8227262632407324,Positive
Relative to STK and Kona Grill my experience so far since weve been in recovery mode is that both of them have done exceptionally well. Meaning that theres a lot of demands. I do believe that Kona Grill because of its suburban exposure just do very well all seven days of the week whereas STK with less of business travellers and group dining is doing very well Thursday through Sunday. So theres a little bit of a shift on how the customers use the brand.,STKS,0.9999580979347228,0.9999161958194944,Positive
But overall I believe that both brands have done extremely well particularly as you look at the numbers that we reported for the month of March. So Im very pleased with both STK and Kona Grill and feel pretty strong about their continued recovery for the rest of the year.,STKS,0.9645789265632628,0.9291578109012906,Positive
Great thats helpful. Next one for me. So can you kind of walk through the cadence of new openings and if theyre going to be licensed or companyoperated and then also the 13 units you expect to open here in 2021 how many of them are Kona Grills,STKS,0.9987542629241944,0.9975085243633537,Positive
So the cadence is  just to reiterate we opened Scottsdale STK which is doing fantastic as you probably saw the numbers on the press release and as we discussed here. So weve been very happy with that and so that opened January 4th. The next opening that were having will be probably Bellevue Washington which is the next one that we have scheduled.,STKS,0.9372854232788086,0.8745707717959712,Positive
And then thereafter we have a Cabo location in Mexico and then we have some U.K. locations after that. Obviously the U.K. is still currently not allowing for indoor dining. I believe that they are  or at least they were planning to go to outdoor dining in April then going to dining in May. So we probably will open those U.K. locations in June or slightly later depending on when the restrictions get lifted there.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then the three FB restaurants that we mentioned on our prepared remarks we probably will be opening them late second quarter early third quarter again depending on how the market conditions are. So thats kind of the spread I would say that well open the majority of those locations by the end of the third quarter this year.,STKS,0.9997067451477052,0.9994134899458231,Positive
And then your other question was in relation to,STKS,0.8274765610694885,0.6549529164748886,Positive
If any of those opening are going to be Kona Grills,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So theyre all STKs right now and other FB brands we do not have any Kona Grills on the numbers that we quoted for development.,STKS,0.1395713984966278,-0.7208582287181786,Negative
Okay thats helpful. And then last one for me. So as youve seen sort of capacity restrictions ease and things get a little bit better have you guys had any trouble bringing on more employees whether its bartenders waiters or chefs or anything like that have you guys faced any sort of headwinds there as capacity has begun to tick back up here,STKS,0.8347491025924683,0.6694980081903983,Positive
I mean generally the answer is no we havent seen any dramatic shifts so far. Obviously were monitoring very closely the fact that unemployment benefits have once again been extended. And last time when that happened it was a little bit more difficult to staff some of the positions so clearly we will benefit. I will I should say we actually will monitor that condition very closely.,STKS,0.2046918869018554,-0.5906171742780056,Negative
I will tell you though the thing that we have seen those the people who are in the restaurants now are staying so weve seen a decrease  a relative decrease in turnover and retentions have gone up. So I would say thats probably the offset to maybe some of those future pressures on getting people in as that the people who are working for us seem to stay with the company. So Im very bullish about the retention trend.,STKS,0.9979512691497804,0.9959025358572817,Positive
And I also think the fact that our operations have been very busy I think the employees that are working in the restaurants feel very very good about being in an active environment. So I get a lot of compliments.,STKS,0.8928823471069336,0.785764566519598,Positive
And frankly a lot of our employees will come up to me and tell me that its good to be in an environment that gets them away from what they consider to be the general seclusion from the pandemic. So employees seem to want to come to work because that gives them an escape from other situations outside of work. So I think thats been very positive.,STKS,0.0350661277770996,-0.9298688947373002,Negative
Its good to hear. Thanks for taking my questions.,STKS,0.9976905584335328,0.9953811141139952,Positive
Youre welcome. Thank you.,STKS,0.9987141489982604,0.997428296463666,Positive
Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. Three questions. But theyre all around the same idea of optimization. So ask them the best that I can. But Im thinking first about the guest behavior and things youve had to do to modify And then of course what used to be normal. So how do you optimize getting in the perfect guest in the door and optimize the facility Is that day a week day part entre mix food versus alcohol How are you thinking about optimizing that,STKS,0.9955612421035768,0.9911224789157387,Positive
So thats a great question Nicole. I think the way that we think is  I told you a year and a half ago that things like selling the incremental drink at the table and selling the dessert at the table were something that we looked forward because that would increase the per person average spend at the table.,STKS,0.997734308242798,0.9954686137846793,Positive
I think in todays environment we think more of table turn. So we really think about getting you in and out at an STK in 90 minutes. And for Kona Grill we target 75. So I think its more of the new reality is that its all about table turns and getting people to  particular the dinner timeframes.,STKS,0.8506424427032471,0.7012847073583051,Positive
And then the other paradigm thats different is that even for a fine dining type of business like STK where in the past we would have looked at maybe brunch as a noncore business we now look at brunch as a core business because now it allows us to use less seats on a Sunday and on a Saturday which are very high demand days. So I think that brunch now is playing a key role in kind of how we think of the business longterm.,STKS,0.9948060512542723,0.9896120963168715,Positive
And then last but not least I think from an operations and execution perspective our teams spend a lot more time just measuring and monitoring the steps of service at the table. And we really do very rigorous review of how long it takes for the order to be taken and cocktails to get to the table.,STKS,0.9426852464675904,0.8853704246106298,Positive
So a very disciplined approach to bringing in the steps of service at the exact times and obviously well always have to balance that with the fact that we dont want to diminish the experience with the gap. So its really balancing the need for turns with need for a smile and move on ph a separate table.,STKS,0.941486954689026,0.8829738396250248,Positive
Okay. And then I was also thinking about optimization through the lens of development. And clearly youve outlined a pipeline today. So thats super helpful. But how did you optimize like less capitalintensive license throwing off cash flow opportunity with STK big box big revenue with the Kona mainstream but a lot of whitespace How did you go through that process in these conditions to optimize that,STKS,0.9898743629455566,0.9797487138204062,Positive
I think a couple of things. So on the development side its what Im seeing from an optimization perspective if you will is that particularly for FB hotel operators Im seeing with the lower occupancy rates theyre less  we  less willing to take the risk on the FB side.,STKS,0.9655643105506896,0.931128580050814,Positive
What I mean by that is that the last thing they want to do is take a business that already has low occupancy and potentially low RevPAR and throwing their high risk if you will restaurants or FB operations and particularly if there are a shop that uses lots of labor for FB. so Im seeing a lot of people wanting to optimize their FB footprint by bringing in people that can execute the FB program at a very high economic or very  or I would actually say very profitable economics for them so I see optimization there.,STKS,0.0737253427505493,-0.8525504187049977,Negative
And then the other thing that we see on the optimizations some of the hotels that were in because of the velocity and the fact that our restaurants are very full on Fridays and Saturdays we become an amenity to the property where people would want to come to the hotel and stay overnight because its so fun and exciting.,STKS,0.9949342012405396,0.9898683964421728,Positive
Im thinking for instance the W in LA is an example where were at that hotel and we have frankly become as the hotel management they will tell us one of the key strengths of their business because were actually super active and bring a lot of excitement there.,STKS,0.9944212436676024,0.9888424806848051,Positive
In terms of Kona Grill growth relative to development as I said earlier were being very very careful about making sure that the first Kona Grill that we do is a super homerun. So weve been very disciplined about the entry in real estate that we have received tremendous amounts of opportunities from existing landlords who now want us to look at other projects and see if there is an opportunity for Kona Grill.,STKS,0.9998900890350342,0.9997801779390443,Positive
I have seen them starting to begin to offer much more TIs on the Kona Grill so almost going to a point where theyre telling you they could almost build a property for us. But frankly right now because of where were at on the pipeline with STK and theres so much demand there for that product we are focusing on it. And obviously we will only take any kind of look at a Kona Grill if its an extraordinary level of economics.,STKS,0.228094220161438,-0.5438124798610686,Negative
So I dont know if that answers your question but certainly tells you that theres a lot of demands and we certainly want to focus on where there is higher level of returns and we certainly dont want to take any opportunities that we feel are not high revenue opportunities.,STKS,0.9247134923934937,0.849426895038423,Positive
Well and it helps us understand the consumer behaviors and whats going on out there  on out there. So its super helpful. Last one Im going to leave it openended purposely so answer or not whatever drops in but how do you optimize your balance sheet I mean that could  Ill just leave it at that. It ties together with the other parts. Thanks.,STKS,0.9994932413101196,0.9989864820161354,Positive
Yes I mean I think right now optimizing the balance sheet is I think emphasizing store level economics. I mean ultimately in the restaurant business thats how you ultimately really build your balance sheet is by having a worldclass economics. And I think if you start looking at it  look at our  if you look at our samestore performance for STK and unit economics back in new stores in Scottsdale at 180000 weekly levels our unit economics are supercompelling. So our restaurants at those volumes of those levels of revenue become super profitable. So thats ultimately our longterm strategy to bring in capital.,STKS,0.8641828894615173,0.7283656170163255,Positive
And as I said earlier in my comments about development I think that the success of the brands today excites landlords and developers. So having an exciting brands that are great amenities to projects to me is frankly the ultimate balance sheet builder because we will be able to get amazing deals and create a tremendous amount of cash flow with very little capital outlays.,STKS,0.998437762260437,0.9968755226585404,Positive
So thats how I look at the shortterm capital view in this and then hopefully as we continue building profitability well be able to work out the cost of debt and other cost of capital in our balance sheet. So ultimately thats our really longterm  longer term strategy for the balance sheet.,STKS,0.9377283453941344,0.8754566165546276,Positive
So focused on store margins keep managing GA super tightly and then ultimately keep developing on asset light. So thats our basic strategy that weve been following.,STKS,0.2274375557899475,-0.545125809386855,Negative
Awesome. Thanks for taking my questions.,STKS,0.9964041709899902,0.9928083376934156,Positive
Thank you Nicole.,STKS,0.9314355850219728,0.8628710883087449,Positive
Our next question comes from the line of Abhishek Malani with Black Diamond Capital. You may proceed with your question.,STKS,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
All right. Thank you for taking my questions. I had a couple. To start can you give us a bit more color on the capacity constraints I know you mentioned that STK typically has more demand on the Thursday to Sunday window. But are restaurants actively turning down potential guests use space limitations And so whats the demand pressure effectively seen And is there a sense of implied capacity that restaurants have hit without coronavirusrelated capacity constraints,STKS,0.9978485107421876,0.9956970189195986,Positive
I mean so I would answer that question by saying that on Fridays Saturdays and Sundays particularly between 630 and 930 in the evening I would say that all of our restaurants are receiving lots more demand that we can fulfill in that timeframe. So yes so in those timeframes I would say that we have received extraordinary amount of demand.,STKS,0.9949756860733032,0.989951366157154,Positive
And frankly our strategy has been through our  how we book reservations. And how even we market we try to shift all the  a lot of that volume to the 930 to 11 timeframe and then try to also shift some of the volume to the 530 frame. So the answer is yes those days are absolutely no problems.,STKS,0.9759752750396729,0.9519505214396247,Positive
I do believe though that on the Mondays through Wednesdays where historically there were more business travellers theres more conventions there were more business type of activities I think those are the days that we probably have more available capacity.,STKS,0.9052112102508544,0.8104223075045986,Positive
So what weve done in those days if youre following what we do on marketing is weve been doing a tremendous amount of social type of activities like date nights on Mondays Tuesdays and Wednesdays because thats one of the occasions that we see super high demand for right now. So were marking for that and I think that actually has been successful to fill in for some of the lack of demand from the business opportunities.,STKS,0.999987542629242,0.9999750852436338,Positive
Awesome and going into a second question slightly different. Can you give us a sense on what percentage of sales are coming from like drinks versus entres in this period versus in the preCOVID period Is there any difference here that we havent seen,STKS,0.2158406376838684,-0.5683196594236251,Negative
Yes so I will say that historically preCOVID our liquor sales would be a 30 plus range whereas in the COVID period weve been in between 25 and 30 on liquor and wine. I will tell you that preCOVID with a number of being a little bit less than 30 I would have been very concerned. But in the postCOVID considering that when you sell more drinks particularly at the table you tend to slow down your turn times at the table.,STKS,0.9997870922088624,0.9995741841639187,Positive
So in our higher volume restaurants particularly between Friday  on Friday Saturday and Sundays although wed like to sell liquor because thats good margin we will trade having more turns on the table than holding a table back for an extra 30 minutes or two and the waiters ph can have a drinks.,STKS,0.9933146238327026,0.9866292396958112,Positive
So a lot of the reason why the liquor mix might be a little bit less is because we are actually driving a different strategy to try to drive more traffic and bring more people through table turns.,STKS,0.7933629751205444,0.5867257039104128,Positive
So I done think per se I guess what Im trying to not make the correlation is that we have less liquor sales because were in COVID I dont think its that per se its  I think its a combination of the strategy of turning the tables and also the fact that some of the areas were still not able to use bar which used to be also a place where people would come in just to have one or two drinks.,STKS,0.1399930715560913,-0.7200148820965779,Negative
So I think the combination of that is what drives it down. But if you look at our  in general if you look at our historical results weve actually been very well managing crowds and I dont think that thats really a big material impact for us in the longterm.,STKS,0.1934457421302795,-0.6131094772276147,Negative
Great. And one last question from me. First off congratulations on the takeout and delivery execution. I was wondering here do we have a sense on what percent of these deliveries and takeout orders are from the current customers versus new adds,STKS,0.9999992847442628,0.999998569487673,Positive
So thats a fantastic question. So  because were very early on the strategy actually a large proportion of our transactions are new transactions weve been very actively promoting. So were still in early stages of heavily promoting it. So I would say that a big portion of it is just new transactions.,STKS,0.9756635427474976,0.95132705648366,Positive
For instance weve used some of the  for instance we use the cheeseburger as a key product to drive interest for STK. And when I say cheeseburger I mean a Wagyu Cheeseburger probably the best  one of the best hamburgers  or cheeseburgers in the industry.,STKS,0.9981673955917358,0.9963347889988357,Positive
So were using promoting to bring people in. And so I think at least in the early stages where were at on takeout and delivery I would say that over 50 of the traffic is still coming from people trying the product.,STKS,0.8751726150512695,0.7503450812966117,Positive
And frankly I looked at as a huge opportunity because as I talk to our teams here our trick is to make sure that through great experience and takeout and delivery we convert those to longterm loyal customers. So I see that as a great opportunity to really build a very robust takeout business and delivery business in the longterm.,STKS,0.9934171438217164,0.9868342797960521,Positive
Im sorry to quickly add so do you think theres any meaningful difference in the types of customers who are doing takeout and delivery versus the customers that are coming instore,STKS,0.8530959486961365,0.7061917222688927,Positive
I think that they are  lots of them are the same customers but different occasions. So theyre  its a more casual occasion. So I would say  and its also a mix of new people who are looking at the different products on the takeout delivery menus.,STKS,0.9986344575881958,0.9972689135485373,Positive
And if you follow our menus they tend to be lower price points. So its also an opportunity for other guests to try the brand. So I think were basically doing both were serving existing restaurants  I mean existing customers for different occasion and bring a tremendous amount of customers with a lower price points particular STK to introduce them to the brand.,STKS,0.9999614357948304,0.9999228715436888,Positive
And were totally okay with that because as we tell the team here is let them try with the takeout menu and then when they have the birthday or the special date or the  or any other holiday which is one of our areas that we do very well theyll remember us and theyll give us a nod on the holidays.,STKS,0.995486617088318,0.9909732287962612,Positive
So we look  or special occasions. So we look even at the consumer that may not be a primary STK consumer as a potential consumer on a special occasion later on.,STKS,0.9925937056541444,0.9851874024792926,Positive
Perfect. Thanks for taking my question.,STKS,0.9944255948066713,0.9888511829681297,Positive
Youre welcome.,STKS,0.98603618144989,0.9720723462536012,Positive

My wish for us all to be here together in person on this day did not come true but my aspiration to be with you today virtually as we celebrate Starbucks and what Starbucks stands for is as strong as ever.

Im honored to share this day with each of you. Im inspired by the story of Starbucks and by all of the partners past and present who have brought us to this special moment.,SBUX,1.0,1.0,Positive
Remember the story of Starbucks our story began with one store the store I am standing in here today at Seattles Pike Place Market. Our journey began in one store and illustrates the power of one one store with a mission grounded in humanity inspiring and nurturing the world one person one cup and one neighborhood at a time.,SBUX,0.932946801185608,0.8658935224375264,Positive
Hello everyone. My name is Camille Hymes a proud 7year partner and Im walking the cobblestones in Seattles historic Pike Place Market the birth place of Starbucks and still home to our first store. Ive been searching for just the right word to describe the journey of Starbucks so far from its start in 1971 selling whole bean coffee to well today 50 years later. The word that keeps coming to mind is epic. And Im not just saying that because Im your narrator.,SBUX,1.0,1.0,Positive
The story of Starbucks is everything twists and turns setbacks and breakthroughs values and pinnacles. Like all good tales there are a few different roads we can take to get to the heart of this one. Today well walk a cobblestone one in Milan Italy. Its on this road where well meet a young man from Seattle on a trip that will forever change the way the world experiences coffee. The year 1983.,SBUX,0.999622642993927,0.9992452855380092,Positive
That young mans name Howard Schultz. He was on his first visit to Italy and as he strolled through the streets and the plazas of Milan he was overwhelmed by the architecture fashion art music the magic of the place and especially its espresso bars. Back home in Seattle Howard was working as the Marketing Director of a small business called Starbucks. At the time Starbucks sold bags of whole bean arabica coffee as well as tea and spices at 4 stores around the city. Now while wandering Italy Howard noticed these casual welcoming coffee houses everywhere.,SBUX,0.999946355819702,0.9998927115754552,Positive
All who entered these cafs were greeted with the same warmth and enthusiasm whether it was their first visit ever or their third that day. The people holding cups of espresso and cappuccino were family and friends coworkers. Even perfect strangers seemed to be so present so connected all amid the joyful clatter of coffee grinders and steaming milk and Italian opera. This scene this experience had a profound effect on Howard. He returned to Seattle with an idea.,SBUX,0.999945878982544,0.9998917579005706,Positive
Now theres no such thing as spoilers when it comes to history. So even though we all know a little something about Howards big idea Im going to keep going because the next part of the story is especially good. Come see. Howard was exhilarated by his idea to bring Italys caf and espresso culture to America but at the time some at Starbucks fell it would be a distraction from their business model of selling whole bean coffee. You have to remember in 1983 most people grew pots of coffee at home using ground coffee from the grocery store drank their coffee at diners or restaurants.,SBUX,0.9597841501235962,0.9195682523061348,Positive
They worried Americans wouldnt embrace Italianstyle coffee houses. But Howard he was determined. Eventually he convinced Starbucks to let him open a test caf inside a single downtown Seattle store. They gave him a little bit of space 300 square feet to be exact and on a rainy morning in April 1984 Starbucks served its first Caff Latte.,SBUX,0.9996896982192992,0.9993793960686896,Positive

At the time a handful of Starbucks whole bean coffee stores in Seattle were serving about 250 customers a day. The store with Howards new coffee bar was soon serving as many as 800 but there was a lot more to Howards idea than serving coffee. He believed coffee could serve to build community empower the human connection the kind of connections that make hard days easier and celebrations sweeter the kind of connections that help us navigate sorrow and help bring us closer to opportunity strength and joy. This belief in the power of coffee to bring us closer was brewed in the first cup Starbucks ever served and its been poured into every cup since. Take a look.,SBUX,0.9098773002624512,0.8197544930902083,Positive
It was here at Seattles historic Pike Place Market that 3 friends opened a little specialty coffee store in 1971. They sold coffee from places like Colombia Indonesia Uganda coffee they roasted themselves and hand scooped into brown paper bags. To name the place they looked out the front door to the waterfront for inspiration. They chose to name Starbucks evoking a character from the classic novel Moby Dick. With the logo they chose a siren as alluring as the coffee itself.,SBUX,0.9995464086532592,0.9990928167657951,Positive
Fast forward to 1987 Howard and a group of investors acquired Starbucks merging Starbucks Coffee with the Il Giornale coffee houses Howard had started 2 years before. This is when the siren logo transformed from brown to green and the aprons did too. Starbucks opened its first stores outside the Puget Sound in Chicago and Vancouver Canada.,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

A culture started to form a culture that would serve as a foundation for the young companys values. Starbucks wrote its first mission statement guided by a commitment to treat each other with respect and dignity. Starbucks also did something unheard of offering full health benefits to employees even for those working part time. And then Starbucks made its employees partners offering equity in the company through bean stock. By the time Starbucks initial public offering came around in 1992 things really started to take off.,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Starbucks Coffee was served on airlines in airports even making a splash on something called the World Wide Web. Soon you could see the siren in storefronts in Los Angeles and New York. We started to make the experience all our own adding comfy chairs and playing jazz and blues. Customers liked our music so much. We began making our own CDs beginning with the Blue Note Blend.,SBUX,0.999974012374878,0.9999480247187764,Positive
Howard was even in a Gap ad. By our 25th anniversary Starbucks was ready to expand beyond U.S. and Canada. To be honest no one was sure how this would go.,SBUX,0.7707790732383728,0.5415578732239443,Positive
But Japan embraced Starbucks and the company soon opened more stores in Asia Pacific before moving on to Europe.,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

And people flocked to our first drivethrus. Other ideas well perhaps they were just ahead of their time. Starbucks tried to make the world a little bit better starting The Cup Fund opening its first Farmer Support Center planting community gardens and reading to kids. But by 2007 cracks were starting to show. Going from 1000 to 13000 stores Starbucks was seemingly everywhere.,SBUX,0.9288654923439026,0.8577308998888133,Positive
But with growth came sacrifice. The company had streamlined its store designs to work anywhere in the world. But to visitors they felt sterile cookie cutter and samestore sales declined for the first time in history.,SBUX,0.7732893824577332,0.5465784946551888,Positive
AudioVideo Presentation,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
It was clear. The company had to do something and so it did. Starbucks partners rededicated themselves to coffee to their customers to each other. Starbucks refocused on its core values and on reigniting peoples passion for coffee and innovation. The companys new mission became a guiding star to inspire and nurture the human spirit one person one cup and one neighborhood at a time.,SBUX,0.997095227241516,0.994190451020271,Positive
This mission gave partners a purpose and something to believe in when they needed it the most and they got to work rebuilding the company. Partners returned to our love affair with coffee and thanked customers for their loyalty and reached out to them in new ways always listening and always learning. And Starbucks made its stores a better reflection of the neighborhoods they served. As Howard would say Dream big and then dream bigger. We bought a coffee farm and Starbucks has continued to celebrate coffee in the places where coffee has grown in stores and in the hearts of partners and customers.,SBUX,0.9997903108596802,0.9995806214693912,Positive
Starbucks started meeting customers where they are and using technology to help improve the connection striving to make sure everyone who walks into a Starbucks feels welcome and valued. 4 years ago in the spot where it all began Starbucks started a new chapter when Howard handed over his key to the Pike Place Store to a new CEO Kevin Johnson.,SBUX,0.9994643926620485,0.9989287846856028,Positive

Starbucks continues to learn and grow as our partners demonstrate what it truly means to nurture the human spirit and how to create a culture of inclusion and warmth where everyone is welcome how to act with boldness and courage to challenge the status quo. For the past 50 years the Starbucks mission and values have been not only an anchor for this journey but the wind in our sails. Who we were in the beginning is who we are today. So as you can see the first 50 years have been quite a ride. You can also start to fathom just how remarkable it was for a small coffee shop from Seattle to become a beloved global brand all the while managing to stay true to its core values.,SBUX,0.9999984502792358,0.9999969005566243,Positive
The Starbucks experience was unwavering. Whether you ordered a coffee at the first Pike Place Market store or at the 17000 stores in Morocco or Guatemala. John Culver who has been at Starbucks since 2002 was one of the leaders who helped to make it happen this way.,SBUX,0.749588131904602,0.49917596529481734,Positive
The success of Starbucks around the world has been defined by our partners and how we show up in every market we serve. Since we opened our very first store outside of North America 25 years ago in Tokyo Starbucks partners have been united by 2 key elements our mission and values and our enduring love for the convening power of coffee. Together partners across the globe have built one of the most admired and trusted companies one focused on caring for our people creating uplifting experiences for our customers and playing a positive role in the communities we serve. Our values are universal. They transcend borders and are why we have seen the love for Starbucks grow beyond the four walls of our stores and now extend into new channels increasing the relevance of Starbucks in peoples daily lives.,SBUX,0.9997084140777588,0.9994168278079198,Positive
Our international partners have helped shape Starbucks making us better stronger and more committed than ever to focus on the mission and values that unite us all. This has always been who we are no matter where we are. This is Starbucks.,SBUX,0.993332028388977,0.9866640488291079,Positive
I grew up drinking tea as do most people in China yet Starbucks has enjoyed early success in this traditionally tea drinking culture and thats all because of our love and passion for coffee. We have devoted ourselves to sharing the unique Starbucks experience with our Chinese customers and local communities the dedicated craftmanship it embodies the uplifting experience it provides and a genuine human connection it inspires. We couldnt be more proud of our partners who pour their hearts into bringing these to life every day through every cup of coffee they brew and every customer connection they make. Each morning as the sun rises on neighborhoods around the globe our partners hold the keys to open more than 32000 doors. Behind each door is a team of Starbucks partners proudly putting on their green aprons and getting ready for the world to wake up so they can once again deliver coffee and connection.,SBUX,1.0,1.0,Positive

Im Rossann Williams a 16year partner and I am still so humbled and so proud of our partners who serve all across the globe. We are 400000 partners strong serving in over 32000 stores all around the world and each and every 1 of us shares deep personal conviction to bring our mission to life to inspire and nurture the human spirit to be that very best moment in every single person today whether you are a partner or a customer. Although weve navigated so much change and faced so many challenges over these past 50 years this last year was a true inflection point for us all a moment where we had to look deep within ourselves to connect with the essence of us to be in service of humanity. Weve had the privilege of becoming the very best version of us becoming stronger smarter and more resilient than ever before. And this was made possible because our partners showed up each and every day with such kindness grace generosity and yes even love.,SBUX,0.8170826435089111,0.6341650689632112,Positive
We know from firsthand experience the ripple effect of doing something good that comes from even the smallest moment of human connection. Whether its a partner wearing a green apron or a partner in service of our partners who wear a green apron all of our partners were determined to serve our customers and our communities every single day. Each one of our partners is a special hero to me as I believe our mission and values have never been more clear more relevant and more meaningful than ever before. And I have never been more confident or optimistic that we can achieve anything were dreaming of because the best is yet to come.

Well here we are in the Tryer Center our 20000squarefoot innovation lab where new ideas enable our Starbucks partners to deliver that great Starbucks experience for each and every customer we serve. This is where new store concepts are designed new coffee equipment is invented and new and exciting beverages come to life. Its also where we are reimagining how to become a more sustainable company so that we give more than we take from the planet. We focus on innovation that inspires our partners and ensure Starbucks remains relevant to the everchanging needs of our customers. For Starbucks its inspiring to think about how a powerful vision came to life in 1 store and then over a 50year period rose to 33000 stores around the world serving over 100 million customer occasions a week prepandemic.,SBUX,0.9989815950393676,0.9979631888647011,Positive
Howard Schultz deserves all the credit for his vision his passion and his perseverance that created one of the worlds most admired brands. Founders of enduring companies like Starbucks create something very special that they know intuitively will connect deeply personally and emotionally many people. That is perhaps why when Howard approached me several years ago I was a bit apprehensive. Founder transitions are significant perhaps the most significant transition a company ever goes through. Succeeding the charismatic founder of an iconic brand that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world well that can be very intimidating.,SBUX,0.9958893060684204,0.9917786072365089,Positive
And so I asked myself What can I bring to the table How can I help advance the mission Is my authentic self good enough And because of my respect for Howard and my love of Starbucks I accepted the challenge embraced the opportunity and grounded myself in one simple concept. My responsibility in leading a transition from founder led to founder inspired was to have the wisdom to know what to honor and preserve from the past while at the same time having the courage to boldly reimagine our future honor the past and reimagine the future wisdom and courage. I knew that we must stay true to the foundation of this great company to our purpose grounded in humanity and to our culture of warmth and belonging. At the same time I knew that we must look boldly to the future adapting the third place for the world and society to come. If we dont honor and stay true to our mission and culture we will lose our way.,SBUX,1.0,1.0,Positive
But in a rapidly changing world if we dont boldly reimagine our future the world will pass us by. Four years ago we gracefully led one of the most significant business transitions any company will ever go through from a founderled to a founderinspired company. And the beautiful thing about being founder inspired is that each and every Starbucks partner can take inspiration and help shape our future. In many ways this was a transition from Howard to all of us. As Starbucks partners we all share an emotional connection to our mission and we all have a responsibility to adapt for the future.,SBUX,0.9994741678237916,0.998948335020742,Positive
I am privileged to work with so many great partners at Starbucks. So what have we done in the past 4 years Well as a team we have transformed the way we innovate building an ethos that allows us to bring great ideas to reality within 100 days. When we fail we do so quickly and we celebrate what we have learned from that thing. And because we constantly learn and adapt we are agile and can respond rapidly to changes in our environment and to the needs of our customers. We have focused on the U.S. and China as our 2 lead markets and that has enabled all other markets to more swiftly follow. We built an alliance with Nestl to expand the global reach of Starbucks into the homes of millions with singleserve and athome coffee. As a team we navigated a global pandemic and we did that by first prioritizing the safety of our partners our customers and our communities second supporting local government and health officials as they work to mitigate and contain the virus and third showing up showing up in a responsible and positive way in each and every community we serve. As we did this we accelerated many of our plans to reinvent the Starbucks experience focusing on mobile convenience and new store formats that reimagine the third place experience.,SBUX,0.999999463558197,0.9999989271157546,Positive
These were strategic plans we put in place long ago which we accelerated to meet this moment. And thats been our approach over these past 4 years to honor the mission values and attributes that create that special Starbucks experience while boldly reinventing for the future. Hasnt this very moment put that philosophy into practice And it has made us an even stronger and more resilient company. Not only have we navigated a global pandemic but we have led with purpose through some of our most trying moments as a society. And we have positioned Starbucks for the inevitable great human reconnection that is about to unfold.,SBUX,0.9997267723083496,0.9994535442909862,Positive
We must respect and preserve the legacy of this great company because that is what makes it resilient and sustainable. If we do that we will not lose our way. At the same time we must look to the future and reinvent this company so that we are not passed by. We cannot be idle. Theres a beautiful balance and harmony in all of this respect and reinvention wisdom and courage the wisdom to know what to preserve from the past and the courage to reinvent the future wisdom and courage.,SBUX,0.9999999403953552,0.9999998807906394,Positive
Thats how I think about Starbucks in this very moment.,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
When Kevin took the helm he clearly reinforced the purposedriven nature of Starbucks and the importance of living our values. At the same time he also began shaping a vision for the future while asking some pretty big questions including how can Starbucks stay uniquely Starbucks while also evolving to meet the needs of an everchanging world. To him knowing what to hold on to mission and values was pretty clear. Theres no question that since the beginning success at Starbucks meant investing in people starting with our partners. In turn our partners take care of our customers and the communities we serve the communities they are a part of.,SBUX,0.9999998807907104,0.9999997615812788,Positive
Few people understand this investment and how it pays off better than our Chief People Officer Angela Lis who began her career as a barista nearly 30 years ago and worked her way up to the executive leadership team.,SBUX,0.9960491061210632,0.992098207532291,Positive
Our partners have been and always will be our heartbeat the thing that most differentiates us as a company and this is by design. Howard is intentional about creating a company in which everyone can share in the success. Its why we call each other partners. We are in it together both this company and this life so why not do everything we can to help each other succeed at both This is a fundamental truth Ive known since 1992 when I started working as a parttime Starbucks barista in Denver Colorado. And its something Ive been demonstrating time and time again as I moved from barista to store manager to recruiter partner resources and to the executive leadership team.,SBUX,0.7834932804107666,0.5669863027252571,Positive

When people feel supported they are more ready to support and inspire others. The truth of this equation is evident in the countless demonstrations of kindness large and small that happen in Starbucks stores around the world each and every day. The bond between Starbucks partners and customers is a remarkable and beautiful thing. Together they exercise daily acts of love. To me its no accident when good things happen. Even in the hardest of times our partners and our customers are making good things happen. Take a look.,SBUX,0.9999862313270568,0.9999724626377,Positive

In the Southwest United States the COVID19 infection rate on the Navajo Nation was at one point even higher than New York City making it one of the hardesthit areas in the entire world. Ty Barbone a Starbucks store manager in Gallup New Mexico wasnt about to stand by as people in his community were suffering.

Incredible. Kudos to barista Brianna Roth who studied American Sign Language for making that moment into a real connection. Here are few important numbers to know about that story. 4000 thats how many of our drivethrus so far have been equipped with the video technology that made this interaction possible. 5.1 million thats how many likes Dallins TikTok video has received so far. And finally forever thats how long Dallin says hell be a customer after this experience.,SBUX,0.9999950528144836,0.9999901056230698,Positive

Karima and Sergio thank you for this reminder that even in the most difficult times good things are happening especially at Starbucks.  Chevonne  a nurse from Brooklyn a longtime customer and possibly the worlds biggest pumpkin spice latte enthusiast told us about what Starbucks means to her and how that has changed this past year to mean even more.

Chevy described Starbucks as a hug in a cup which she said was particularly important this year when hugs have been hard to come by. I think its absolute magic the small moments of connection Chevy tried to give her patients at the hospital. And I love that she finds these small moments of connection for herself at Starbucks. As much as we have changed over the last 50 years its moments like the one Chevy described that this company does best. Kevin knew that for Starbucks to be able to keep doing this for another 50 or 100 or 150 years we must keep investing in people honoring the craft of coffee and believing in the power of the human connection.,SBUX,0.9998790621757508,0.9997581242073326,Positive
But what other things would Starbucks need to do to meet and exceed the demands of a changing world Now that would take some bold reimagining. AudioVideo Presentation,SBUX,0.0839755833148956,-0.8320499253570589,Negative
In just the past few years we have fundamentally positioned this company for the future. Weve done this by staying true to our mission and living our values but also while reimagining and adapting for the future. An enduring company is one that routinely adapts in order to stay relevant to the stakeholders it serves and that is exactly what Starbucks has done over the course of the past 50 years. Its true the pace of change has accelerated this past year as we navigated a global pandemic. And now as all of humanity emerges from this pandemic and as we advance on the journey for social justice and equality we are on the precipice of a seismic shift as humans once again seek human connection as we always do. And Starbucks was built for connection. Starbucks was built for this moment.,SBUX,0.9999032616615297,0.9998065232077382,Positive
Think about how perfectly positioned Starbucks is to rise to this moment. Sadly this pandemic has created a crisis of isolation. And we are a company built on a mission of human connection. This pandemic has dampened spirits. And our mission is to uplift it every day.,SBUX,0.8894894123077393,0.7789786928765134,Positive

Its not just happened today. Over the past few years we have reimagined the third place one which remains focused on human connection but has evolved to meet our customers where they are and how they choose to connect. We have built Starbucks for this moment. We are the third place outside of home and outside of work where we find community and acceptance. Acceptance without exception inclusion in every way.,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
But what about the moments to come What about the next 50 years not just the coming 12 months We are building a company that gives back more than we take. We aim to give back more than we take when it comes to people the planet and creating prosperity for all stakeholders. When it comes to people I think we have a unique opportunity to use our reach and scale to create a better society to create a more inclusive society in which people can pursue their dreams and feel a sense of community.,SBUX,0.995536744594574,0.9910734838685298,Positive

When it comes to our planetpositive agenda we aspire to give more than we take from the planet and we set goals for ourselves to achieve carbonneutral green coffee and reduce water usage in green coffee processing by 50 both by 2030. Next year in fact we will open the Starbucks Coffee Innovation Park in China our first sustainable coffee roasting plant.

And here in the United States were supporting dairy farmers and farmworkers to improve their livelihood. We are extending the same approach we use to empower coffee farmers to support dairy farmers across the United States. And I want to make clear that for Starbucks these peoplepositive and planetpositive goals are not sidecars to the engine of profit. We pursue these objectives with the same level of focus and discipline that drives our business.,SBUX,0.996048092842102,0.9920961809731608,Positive
Weve established metrics. We are being intentional transparent and accountable in everything we do for people and the planet in the same way we do as we run our business. We are grounded in the belief that forprofit companies need to serve a purpose beyond the pursuit of profit and a forprofit company can serve and create value for all stakeholders. In fact for the 19th consecutive year Starbucks has been one of Fortune magazines Most Admired Brands. And this year we moved up in ranking to become the fifth Most Admired Company in the world.,SBUX,0.9995324015617372,0.9990648025660533,Positive
We were also named for the 13th year by Ethisphere as one of the Worlds Most Ethical Company.,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Over the past 4 years Starbucks has made so much progress in our people and planet initiatives while also delivering 95 in total shareholder returns and increasing our market cap by nearly 40 billion. Thats how we know that this can be done in harmony. We know that we can be a planetpositive and a peoplepositive company while also pursuing a profitpositive agenda. We know that everyone who has a stake in Starbucks will be lifted when Starbucks succeeds. Maybe its a uniquely Starbucks version of capital.,SBUX,1.0,1.0,Positive

Id like to say that I came to Starbucks for the Espresso and its true I did. But I stayed because of the people the partners. The partners at Starbucks are truly like no other. Were all here because we believe wholeheartedly in being part of a different kind of company. The kind of company where as Kevin said we work together to balance the need for profit with our commitment to creating a positive impact on the world. Thats inspiring.,SBUX,0.9999064207077026,0.9998128413038501,Positive
And over my tenure with the company if Ive learned anything its that our partners want to be inspired. They need to believe in what theyre doing because belief and conviction create an enduring brand and an enduring company. Ive seen firsthand that a forprofit company can absolutely create value for all stakeholders. In fact I believe its what makes Starbucks so successful. We all benefit when we use our profit to fuel the betterment of our planet and the people on it both in our communities and at the world at large.,SBUX,0.9999916553497314,0.9999833106895153,Positive

Have you ever stopped to consider what kind of ripples you create in your communities and in the world Even the smallest acts of kindness or service can be a wave of good that reaches further than you may know. Store Manager Cameron Moore understands this better than most. 15 years ago the compassion of 1 stranger at 1 community organization helped change the trajectory of her life. This year Cameron with the help from the Starbucks Foundation was able to bring that ripple of kindness from all those years ago to full circle.,SBUX,0.9991803169250488,0.9983606328729586,Positive

Just as were at our best when we serve others were at our brightest when we give more than we take from each other and from the planet. Starbucks has made a number of commitments to reduce our carbon water and waste in order to do just that. Were also looking for opportunities to take less and give more in every aspect of our business from expanding plantbased menu items to exploring ways to reduce food waste and from shifting away from singleuse packaging to developing more ecofriendly operations across stores supply chain and manufacturing. Were even looking for ways to revolutionize the way our coffee is grown.,SBUX,0.9621217250823976,0.9242434050103459,Positive
Our coffee farm Hacienda Alsacia in Costa Rica is a hub of research and development.

Good morning shareholders and partners. My name is Rachel Gonzalez and Im Starbucks General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Its an honor to present the formal portion of our meeting today.

Broadridge has appointed Mr. Andrew Wilcox as the Inspector of Elections to tabulate the votes.,SBUX,0.8829957246780396,0.7659913098760307,Positive
The first order of business is the election of the directors as nominated by the Board. The nominees are as follows Mellody Hobson our incoming independent Board chair CoChief Executive Officer and President Ariel Investments Kevin Johnson our President and Chief Executive Officer Richard E. Allison Jr. Chief Executive Officer and Director of Dominos Pizza Inc. Andrew Campion Chief Operating Officer of Nike Inc. Mary Dillon Chief Executive Officer and Director Ulta Beauty Inc.

The Board recommends a vote for each of the nominees.,SBUX,0.9435283541679382,0.8870566410163885,Positive
The second item of business is the approval of an advisory resolution on our executive compensation program. The Board recommends a vote for this proposal.,SBUX,0.9931275248527528,0.9862550415128719,Positive
The third item of business is the ratification of the selection of Deloitte  Touche LLP as the companys independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year ending October 3 2021. The Board recommends a vote for this proposal.,SBUX,0.947901487350464,0.8958029125946241,Positive
The fourth and last item of business is the shareholder proposal submitted by Mr. A  James McRitchie regarding employee board representation. Out of respect for the other shareholders in attendance and to allow ample time for QA we ask you Mr. McRitchie to please limit your comments to a period of 3 minutes or less. Mr. McRitchie are you on the line,SBUX,0.2260387539863586,-0.5479234146615355,Negative
Yes. Thank you. Weve been listening and seeing how important partners are to Starbucks. Proposal number 4 aims at increasing diversity by adding a worker to the pool of candidates to be considered for a position on the Board. The idea is to increase the voice of partners.,SBUX,0.990075945854187,0.9801518798779725,Positive
Instead of considering a partner for a possible seat at the table the Board responded with Our partners have numerous ways to be heard and to exert influence outside of board representation. Partners can access an ethics help line accompany an organization meeting partnerled groups and anonymous surveys. The Board says giving nonmanagement employees a dedicated position on the Board or applying a different set of qualifications would adversely impact the role of the Board.,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
But the proposal does not ask for a dedicated position for partners. It does not ask for a different set of qualifications in selecting Board members. It only seeks to have partners considered in the initial pool. Surely at least one of our 400000 partners is worth considering for a seat at the table. If youre a partner in a firm or a marriage youre on the same team right But our Board refused to consider any significant step to increase the voice of partner.,SBUX,0.9966987371444702,0.993397470353526,Positive
The Board could have appointed a formal workforce advisory panel or designated a director to be a liaison with our partner. They could have set up a substantive Employee Stock Ownership Plan an ESOP with voting rights held by partners or their elected trustees a worker on the Board a workforce advisory panel or a designated director to institutionalize ongoing dialogue an ESOP with trustees elected by partners that have a real influence on Board composition.,SBUX,0.9973825216293336,0.9947650401383881,Positive
Any of these changes would engage and empower our partners leading to a better place to work and a more profitable company. Instead our Board refused to negotiate. This is an advisory proposal that is much more flexible than federal legislation being considered.,SBUX,0.1908038854598999,-0.6183931937177144,Negative
Im interested in hearing from other shareholders and especially from partners email me at jmcorpgov.net thats JMCORPGOV.net and please vote for proposal 4. Let the Board know giving partners a more formal voice is important to you. Thank you very much.,SBUX,0.9998708963394164,0.9997417925249292,Positive
Thank you Mr. McRitchie. For the reasons outlined in our proxy statement the Board has recommended a vote against this shareholder proposal.,SBUX,0.961766481399536,0.9235329172211391,Positive
From its beginning Starbucks has set out to be a different kind of company one where performance is measured through the lens of humanity. And the role of our partners is central to our decisions.,SBUX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Human connection is at the center of our vision our business strategies and our investments and we are obsessive about obtaining the partner perspective that is the focus of this shareholder proposal through multiple channels which include continuously engaging in discussions with our partners to learn how to improve their experiences. We take information communicated to us by our partners seriously and we regularly provide responses and updates on issues that our partners raise. We value engagement with our partners and we remain intentional in cultivating a culture of inclusion and diversity with a focus on partner retention and development.,SBUX,0.9929423928260804,0.9858847772388324,Positive
During 2020 alone we held hundreds of partner engagement events such as open forums focus groups town halls and partner connect conversations. The views and experiences of our partners help to guide managements decisionmaking and the Boards oversight of those decisions. In this way and as further described in our proxy statement the Board and its Nominating and Governance Committee should retain the flexibility to determine the director nominees who are best suited to serve all Starbucks stakeholders.,SBUX,0.9985140562057496,0.9970281106401151,Positive
Given our frequent and varied partner communication opportunities for partner feedback and our robust director nominating process together with our current Board diversity and governance practices our Board of Directors believe that taking the steps contemplated by this proposal to alter the director nomination process and to mandate that a specific category of nominee be considered by the Board and to risk distilling all partner voices into one is simply not in the best interests of our partners or our shareholders or our business.,SBUX,0.9693814516067504,0.938762866713325,Positive

Great. Thanks for the question. Rachel perhaps you can answer that,SBUX,0.999181628227234,0.9983632554788922,Positive
Yes. Thank you for that question. Starbucks has a longstanding commitment to diversity on its Board of Directors.

We also have joined the Board Diversity Action Alliance which is an initiative designed to increase racially and ethnically diverse representation on public company boards.,SBUX,0.9998837113380432,0.9997674225374595,Positive

Yes. Thanks for the question. Ill take that one. First of all we do not have a political action committee and therefore we do not make political contributions. We certainly with our partners we encourage them to get involved in their civic responsibility as citizens to vote.,SBUX,0.9902515411376952,0.980503070654315,Positive

Thank you Kevin. A third question. The recent raise for partners has made Starbucks a more exciting opportunity and has made baristas feel more confident that they are being valued. Would you commit to a raise for shift supervisors to incentivize baristas to move up and make shift supervisors feel they are valued for all of the extra responsibilities they take on,SBUX,0.9861235618591307,0.9722471071762484,Positive

Thank you Kevin. In November of 2020 Starbucks shared one of the largestever wage investments of at least a 10 increase for every single partner including our shift supervisors. With these recent investments more than 30 of our partners today already are at or over 15 an hour and we remain committed to what we have already previously communicated which is that we will ensure that every single partner in U.S. business will be at the minimum of 15 an hour over the next few years.,SBUX,0.1030133962631225,-0.79397427676575,Negative
We have always approached our compensation comprehensively with a holistic partner rewards and benefits philosophy. So in addition to our base pay or hourly wage we also offer a very diverse and meaningful cobenefit package that includes health care mental health support granting share options to every single partner because we always share our success with one another. And we even offer a free online college university for those partners that might want to take advantage of higher education.,SBUX,0.999999225139618,0.9999984502783124,Positive

And even with this broad footprint we do see a tremendous runway for growth in both existing and in new markets. Well continue to partner with and provide guidance to our licensees as they grow our portfolio in 3 key ways one providing consistent and elevated customer experience around the world ensuring that our brand remains financially attractive to our licensees and leveraging our learnings from the U.S. and China. So those Starbucksproven success drivers are adopted in markets around the world.,SBUX,0.9999994039535522,0.999998807906394,Positive
So for example were applying right now how to engage customers digitally in new and convenient ways to drive traffic. And we also have new store formats that are reducing both the investment and operating costs for our licensees. As we previously  as previously shared our aim is to be in 100 markets by the year 2030. And working with our licensees to adopt these proven success drivers gives us confidence in our future growth potential for our licensees and for Starbucks.,SBUX,0.7826018333435059,0.5652034075280472,Positive

Thank you. Thank you Kevin. We have come a long way in China from a year ago when we faced huge uncertainty around the pandemic situation. Starbucks response was guided by 3 core principles as Kevin has always reinforced to prioritize the health and wellbeing of our partners and customers play a constructive role in supporting local government authorities as they work to contain the spread of the virus and show up in a positive and responsible way to serve our communities.,SBUX,0.9599946737289428,0.9199892997677919,Positive
We closed 80 of our stores at the peak of the pandemic last year. We needed to take care of our partners and their families by providing them with jobs and financial security. We continued to pay them even when our stores were closed. We also stepped up additional insurance benefits in the event that they or their family members may need it. We also provided free counseling and emotional support services for partners and their family members.,SBUX,0.0004854798316955,-0.9990302318514777,Negative
So fast forward to today and the pandemic has been mostly eradicated apart from cases of local resurgences from time to time which have been effectively contained we are now working very closely with the relevant authorities to get access to vaccination for our partners as soon as possible to protect themselves our customers and local communities. I cant be prouder to work for a company that has led through our values and focuses on doing the right thing in every decision we make. Thank you.

As Kevin also shared partner and customer safety has always been our 1 priority from the very first day of this pandemic. Weve taken and will continue to take significant actions to protect our partners which includes requiring both partners and customers to continue to wear facial covering when inside our stores implementing industryleading safety and sanitization standards like installing plexiglass wherever a partner and a customer may interact enhancing our instore sanitization protocols throughout the day and requiring daily health checks for every single partner we also continue to protect all existing benefits and support partners by providing pay for any time missed due to the exposure to or the diagnosis of COVID19 that happens to require a partner to selfquarantine finally we continue to offer temporary COVID leave of absence for any partner who may not be able to work at this time for personal reasons like homeschooling or highrisk medical conditions and are provided the same exact benefits that they would have if they were still working. We remain committed to continuing to make proactive decisions that are grounded in transparency facts in the science to do everything we can to provide that safest possible store experience keeping our partners and our customer safe.,SBUX,0.9646016359329224,0.9292032296676813,Positive

Yes. Thank you Kevin. More than happy to answer this question. First off let me just say weve built worldclass business partnerships which have enabled us to accelerate and amplify the growth of Starbucks outside of our retail stores around the world. Through the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestl weve been able to rapidly expand our packaged goods singleserve and into the foodservice channels as weve expanded to 62 markets now over the last 2 years.,SBUX,0.998748779296875,0.9974975571021778,Positive
This past year Starbucks became the 1 brand in athome coffee increasing our share and growing our business over 13.

Were also leveraging our RTD partnerships across  outside the U.S. and have now established Starbucks as the premium segment leader in China with 36 volume growth this past year and 25 volume growth across EMEA. Its clear that our customers have embraced the Starbucks brand in channels outside of our retail stores and we will continue to invest in our partnerships and innovate to grow this very very important business for the company.,SBUX,0.999977171421051,0.9999543428148883,Positive

And while the pandemic temporarily disrupted our business its catalyzed a more rapid innovation and transformation to position us for even a brighter future. Our balance sheet remains strong given our cash balance of over 5 billion at the end of Q1 and the continued recovery we see in our operating cash flows. In fact given the strength of our cash flows we were able to meaningfully deleverage our balance sheet this year by paying off our debt that matured totaling over 1.5 billion and are on a path to return to 3x leverage target by the end of this fiscal year. We remain very excited about our longterm growth potential and the plans and initiatives that we have to unlock the full potential of the Starbucks brand continuing to drive doubledigit nonGAAP earnings growth as we scale.

Well thanks for the question. We are focused on helping in any way we can. States across the country and around the world countries around the world build vaccination capacity.

Thank you Monica. Good evening everybody. So lets start with the highlight of the period. I am in Slide number 2 of your deck. Net ordinary income came in at the top of the range up by 9 yearonyear demonstrating the resiliency of our business model even in a year of unprecedented disruption.,ENLAY,0.9985289573669434,0.9970579129802661,Positive
Our remarkable operating and financial delivery results in a proposed dividend per share of 0.358 per share which marks a 9 increase versus 2019. Its worth to highlight that the 2020 dividend per share is higher than the 0.35 per share guaranteed dividend per share for the year demonstrating once again the capability of our business model to generate value to our shareholders.,ENLAY,0.999985933303833,0.9999718665908972,Positive

Simplification of group structure accelerated further with the approval of the merger of Enel Green Power Latin America assets into the Enel Amricas asset base. Lastly in January Moody upgraded the group credit rating to Baa1. In the next slide we will have a closer look at our operating and financial performance.,ENLAY,0.8559963703155518,0.7119925689652973,Positive
We are now in Slide number 3. 2020 has brought exceptional challenges with a pandemic that imposed radical changes to the way we operate and live. Notwithstanding this long emergency we have been able to progress on all our key strategic priorities. We have built 3100 megawatts of renewable capacity.,ENLAY,0.9988073110580444,0.997614620694292,Positive
When I say built I mean built and connected to the networks. With the share of digitized end users reached 60 with a total of 44 million smart meters installed. Our retail customer base in the free market grew by 200000 customers and a further milestone in the electric mobility was achieved with more than 100000 charging points installed.,ENLAY,0.986886978149414,0.9737739406668784,Positive
The widespread digitalization of our asset base and the use of platform ensured operational continuity as well protected the health of our colleagues and suppliers. This topnotch delivery translated into a 22 total return for our shareholders driven by a 17 share price appreciation and a 5 dividend yield significantly outperforming the broader utilities sector. We are quite well positioned to meet our ambitions in the long term and we see that in Chart number 4.,ENLAY,0.9989391565322876,0.9978783117999506,Positive

In 2020 we have marked up the next stepup of our delivery capabilities with around 4000 megawatts new capacity build expected. This goal was not achieved because COVID19 caused delays in projects for around 800 megawatts which were supposed to be commissioned in late 2020.,ENLAY,0.1250720620155334,-0.7498569189649338,Negative
However our building platform proved its resiliency. Therefore we expect a quick recovery of these delays into 2021 with further progress on new installation that are expected to exceed the 5000 megawatts during 2021. We will triple our capacity by 2030 confirming our position as a renewables super major.,ENLAY,0.7916320562362671,0.5832638640784407,Positive
New renewable capacity needs to be connected to a resilient and digitized network as a backbone for the energy transition.

The efficient management of our networks relies on the adoption of a platform operating model.,ENLAY,0.9599885940551758,0.9199771404130104,Positive
This allows us to increase the level of service quality. In fact SAIDI decreased 12 in this year and is expected to decrease further to 100 minutes in 2030. Higher quality will couple with an expanding value of our asset base which will reach 70 billion by 2030.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Benefits from a unique position of around 60 of our customers are in developed areas and a very large portion is living in megacities.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The composition of our commercial portfolio allows us to minimize the impact on COVID19 and position us for the years to come. The acceleration of electrification will dramatically increase the market dimension and the ongoing elimination of the regulated tariff are creating new value pools.,ENLAY,0.934101700782776,0.8682033230086108,Positive
In this concept our B2C B2B and B2G customers managed through a single and crosscompany platform are offered with beyond commodity services that represents a crucial competitive advantage that will drive the increase of retail value that we see over the next decade. This positioning of the group has been built over time. We have invested significantly in this.,ENLAY,0.1519499719142913,-0.6961010671264335,Negative
Now lets focus on the CapEx that we deployed in 2020 on Slide 7. We deployed in 2020 more than 10 billion of CapEx. In the ownership business model 50 of this CapEx was devoted to the generation business out of which 4.2 billion is for renewables development and more than 40 has been invested in networks to foster digitalization and quality improvements.,ENLAY,0.873566746711731,0.747133342703189,Positive
From a geographical perspective gross CapEx was deployed mainly in Italy Spain and Latin America. Through the stewardship model we have invested 800 million of which 100 million through equity injection by further capitalizing around 1.5 billion of investment from third parties. These investments were devoted to renewables where we continue to add capacity managed by our joint ventures and then by Enel X and open fiber.,ENLAY,0.7751903533935547,0.5503804387929672,Positive
Looking closely at our global generation business on Slide number 8 we can see that thanks to a continued effort on decarbonization renewables production is up 5 versus last year accounting for more than half of the total 217 terawatt hours generated in 2020 overtaking the conventional generation.,ENLAY,0.9835662841796876,0.9671325487688476,Positive
As a consequence of the coal phaseout process we are putting in place any contraction in demand which resulted from the COVID pandemia thermal generation declined by 22 yearonyear driven by these two factors the sharp contraction of coal production which turned down went down by 65 yearonyear. This led CO2specific emissions down by 28 yearonyear reaching 214 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour which positions us well on track to reach the sciencebased target of CO2specific emissions of 82 grams per kilowatt hour in 2030.,ENLAY,0.002901941537857,-0.994197305558506,Negative
Now lets focus on the progress we made in renewable growth. So we go to the Enel Green Power Slide number 9 where you see that renewable capacity built last year amounted to like I said 3100 megawatts breaking yet another delivery record which was the one we established last year despite the postponement of around 800megawatt imposed by COVID19related conditions.,ENLAY,0.9997633695602416,0.9995267388383975,Positive
Out of this amount 1400 megawatts were commissioned in the last quarter of 2020. As such they have not yet fully contributed to the group financial results. Total renewable capacity now stands at 49 gigawatts representing almost 60 of the installed base. The green repositioning of our generation portfolio drives the share of emissionfree production up. It is now 65 up eight percentage points versus 2019.,ENLAY,0.9326514601707458,0.8653028400557279,Positive
This year 2021 you will see a further acceleration. New capacity built is set to total in the year more than 5000 megawatts. And its currently fully visible because it is underway and it is already 100 in the execution process. Decarbonization process is also predicated on the acceleration on coal phaseout. And you can see that in the Chart number 10 which follows.,ENLAY,0.9944775104522704,0.9889550143212162,Positive
Over the year we have reduced by almost 25 our coal capacity shutting down 2.8 gigawatts and bringing the coal instore capacity below 9. The key milestones of the year were in Italy following the green light of the early closure of home number two of the Brindisi power plant and the shutdown was executed by the end of 2020.,ENLAY,0.6932881474494934,0.3865759292697486,Positive
In Chile Enel Generacin Chile terminated the operation of Bocamina I in December three years earlier than originally scheduled. And also its worth to mention that during 2020 we agreed with the Chilean government in the early closure of Bocamina II in May 2022 instead of the original deadline of 2040 so this is 18 years earlier.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Production from coal stood at 13.2 terawatt hours down by the outstanding 65 from previous year. Revenues from coal now amount to 2.5 of total Enel Group revenues down by one percentage point versus last year.,ENLAY,0.1617353558540344,-0.6765302875818537,Negative
Now lets focus on the main engine supporting our growth ambition in renewables. That is our large pipeline. This is Page 11. This is where the next growth will come from. So our future deployment target rely on this ample technologically balanced and geographically diversified pipeline which at,ENLAY,0.9998584389686584,0.999716877768563,Positive
So as of December 2020 has reached more than 200000 megawatts 1.5 points  1.5x higher than the one presented in the Capital Market Day in November. Mature phase pipeline worth around 60000 megawatts provides a giant reservoir for our 21 23 capacity deployment offering ample flexibility in terms of capital allocation and protection of returns.,ENLAY,0.9997275471687316,0.9994550940126739,Positive
With respect to the 19.5 targeted addition for the three years period we stand at around 54 of this target already addressed with over 10000 megawatts currently in execution. The residual target of 9.5 gigawatts is covered 3.5x by the portion of our mature pipeline with commissioning data within 2023. This offers ample visibility on delivery of our three years target and confidence in achieving even more than this as it is as you have probably seen our custom.,ENLAY,0.0699579119682312,-0.8600852847607641,Negative
The level of target address and the flexibility offered by our pipeline backstop the probability of targeted addition expected to remain stable at 200 basis points spread over WACC in line with our planned expectations. It is worth to highlight that in terms of equipment we have already contracted orders that cover almost in full our needs until 2022.,ENLAY,0.1777657270431518,-0.644469526093916,Negative
So if we look at the operating achievement we now move to global infrastructure and networks and this is Slide number 12 the efforts devoted to quality and efficiency yielded a remarkable progress. SAIDI down across all grids operated by us by around 12 notwithstanding COVID19 activities on networks remained centered on the digitalization of the grids with the number of total smart meters installed that has reached 44 million resulting in approximately 60 of our enduser now fully digitized.,ENLAY,0.9123431444168092,0.8246861843384412,Positive
In 2020 volume of electricity distributed decreased by 4.5 across all countries of operation due to the dynamics associated with lockdown measures. Worth to highlight that the first six months of the year have been the most impacted. Because in the first six months we saw volumes down 8 on average while in the second half of 2020 volume started to show progressive recovery.,ENLAY,0.7842174768447876,0.5684346964566089,Positive
This trend is expected and observed to continue in 2021. As a matter of fact in the first six  in the first three months of 2021 we observed a level of distributed energy almost in line with preCOVID levels. Now Alberto will walk you through the economic impacts associated with networks for the period later on.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Lets now look at the closer look on the customer dimension. This is Chart number 13. Clients positioning has continued to strengthen via retail traditional operation as well as on new services and infrastructures. This is allowing us to tap future value associated with increasing electrification of consumption. 200000 new customers net have been added to the  in the free market mainly in Italy.,ENLAY,0.9998451471328736,0.9996902940811483,Positive
Energy sold in the free market is down 7 due to COVID19 dynamics. Alberto will detail later the economic performance of the retail business which as you will see has proven very resilient leveraging on the group integrated positioning.,ENLAY,0.7501429319381714,0.5002855660233294,Positive
Looking at Enel X this global business line has performed extremely well despite COVID19. More than 100000 charging points have been installed at this point reaching around 190000 up 2.3 times versus last year.,ENLAY,0.91465026140213,0.8293004210593824,Positive
Lighting points have reached 2.8 million around the world up by 17. Battery storage has reached a capacity of over 120 megawatts. And 6000 megawatts of demand response capacity was offered globally. In fiber we have passed 11.1 million households in Italy up 41 yearonyear.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Let me now briefly summarize our progress on the simplification of the group on Slide number 14. In September 2020 the Board of Directors of Enel Amricas has announced the mergers of EGP assets in Latin America with the assets of Enel Amricas. This is a related party transaction which was approved by the EGM in December 2020.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Together with the merger the EGM also approved the elimination of 65 shareholding limit established by the bylaws. Following completion of the merger expected by a few days from now April 1 annual stake in Latin America will be slightly above 75.,ENLAY,0.977141261100769,0.9542824949517816,Positive
Furthermore on March 15 we have launched a voluntary partial public tender offer for the acquisition of shares and ADS of Enel Amricas representing up to 10 of the current share capital for a total maximum cash out of around 1.2 billion. The price of the offer has been set at CLP 140 trillion per share.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Once completed and if this will be fully subscribed this public tender could lead to Enel owning an 82 stake in Enel Amricas. The public tender is expected to run until mid of April. Enel Amricas new asset structure will now be aligned with the rest of the other subsidiaries of the group. The merger of renewable capacity will unlock synergies as well as reduce operational and financial risk and will drive growth into Enel Amricas.,ENLAY,0.9998731017112732,0.9997462032712718,Positive
Finally lets move to shareholder remuneration on Slide number 15. The resiliency of the business model we have the high standards of operating performance and the action of the management have put in place allowed us to deliver sound operating and financial results notwithstanding the COVID crisis.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We will therefore propose a dividend per share of 0.358 per share up 9 versus the previous year and also above the minimum guaranteed dividend per share set for 2020 that was 0.35 per share.,ENLAY,0.9869166016578674,0.9738331877190993,Positive
From next year the shareholder remuneration will follow the strategic guidelines that we have outlined in November where we set a simple and predictable dividend policy guaranteeing a fixed dividend per share over the next three years which you see in Chart number 15 0.38 0.40 0.43 in the years 21 22 23. This policy coupled with earnings  with the growth of earnings will position Enel as a toptiered total return company.,ENLAY,0.9964678287506104,0.992935653290542,Positive

Good afternoon to you all. So lets now have a look on the financials of the year and now we are on Page 17. EBITDA stood at 17.9 billion in line versus previous year. Group net ordinary income increased to 5.2 9 higher versus last year. FFO reached 11.5 billion broadly in line versus last year mainly thanks to the improvements in working capital which has been almost totally reabsorbed in the last quarter of the year despite the second wave of COVID19.,ENLAY,0.9999591708183287,0.9999183415879853,Positive
And finally group net debt stood at 45 billion increasing by 1 versus the end of 2019. Before going through the details of the financial performance of the each division let me comment the evolution of the scenario over 2020 and Im on Page 18.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
As commented during previous releases this unprecedented global emergency translated into a strong deterioration of the market context impacting negatively demand and triggering a severe devaluation of currencies. FX represented the main headwind to our 2020 results and worth around 1 billion at EBITDA level. LatAm currencies devaluated by 20 on average over the year with Brazilian reais as one of the currencies that has weaken the most.,ENLAY,0.0431307852268219,-0.913739570224029,Negative
As you can see on the right side of the chart electricity demand has shown a progressive recovery in the second half of the year across all countries of presence even if still shows negative trends compared to the last year.,ENLAY,0.0356649160385131,-0.9286713175006615,Negative
I will show in the next slide the impact of business headwinds. We are now on Slide number 19. The groups EBITDA was mainly affected by the following negative impacts as I said around 1 billion from the devaluation of currencies and 730 million associated with COVID19 dynamics related to the sharp contraction of volumes for roughly 600 million impacting retail activities worldwide and networks in LatAm and other dynamics mainly associated with losses downing processes and delays in investments and developments for around 130 million. Net of both COVID19 impact and FX EBITDA would have been up by 9 yearonyear at 19.6 billion.,ENLAY,0.9087391495704652,0.8174781903494541,Positive
Moving down the profit and loss the pandemic affected DA pushing up the level of bad debt provisioning by roughly 300 million. On the groups ordinary net income the crisis translated into a burden of 450 million topped up by a negative FX impact of around 250 million. Net of both COVID19 FX net income would have been up by around 24.,ENLAY,0.0378467440605163,-0.9243076588557119,Negative
Lets now comment group EBITDA and Im on Slide number 20. As already commented the reported EBITDA 17.9 flat yearonyear and showing a solid improvement of the underlying operating performance despite the adverse scenario. On generation the new renewable capacity developed has driven the operating performance while the management of generation margins together with our retail portfolio continued to protect the economic results against market fluctuations.,ENLAY,0.999254822731018,0.9985096445737149,Positive
And finally on networks the performance recorded in the European countries has been supported by solid regulatory frameworks as well as by our quality and efficiency programs while LatAm has been severely hit by currencies and demand contraction.,ENLAY,0.0912699699401855,-0.8174611434108875,Negative
Now we will move in a deeper analysis and now we are on Page 21 on Global Power Generation where we take  on Page 21 we take a look at the performance of the Global Power Generations division. And in the following slides we will go more in detail through the performance of energy power and conventional generation.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Overall the Global Power Generation ordinary EBITDA stood at around 7 million 12 higher versus the same period of last year. Excluding the negative impact of FX performance was up by 20 yearonyear. The unitary gross margin increased by 8 from 59.9 to 43.2 as you can see in the chart. And this improved profitability comes from a higher share of renewables in the mix compared to one year ago.,ENLAY,0.99485582113266,0.9897116361329774,Positive
Worth to remind you that last year performance included around 100 million of capital gain associated with the full consolidation of our North American assets as well as 160 million of positive contribution associated with the early termination of a PPA contract in Chile. In addition as already commented during the previous releases the period has been positively affected by a provision reversal in Spain for around 170 million mainly booked within conventional generation.,ENLAY,0.9909380674362184,0.9818761240697649,Positive
And now well go a deep dive on Enel Green Power and we move on Slide 22. Ordinary EBITDA stood at 4.7 billion 2 higher versus last year. As mentioned in the previous slide 2019 was also positively affected by the capital gain associated with the full consolidation of North American assets and the early termination of PPA contract in Chile the overall impact in 2019 was 180 million. So the underlying operating performance is up 300 million taking into account also this oneoff.,ENLAY,0.9755346775054932,0.9510693258460319,Positive
And so the main items of this 300 million are a positive contribution of 500 million coming from the additional capacity installed in 2020 mainly in U.S. and Brazil. And worth to highlight that around 1.4 gigawatts commissioned in the last quarter have not yet fully contributed the results and will generate around 160 million EBITDA in 2021.,ENLAY,0.997476041316986,0.994952079625177,Positive
Then we had 100 million coming from an improving performance of hydropower plant higher and fully hedged price that impacted positively for around 75 million 60 million from efficiencies and on notice OpEx megawatt decreased 10 versus end of 2019 highlighting the continued focus of the group on efficiencies FX devaluation of LatAm currencies had a negative impact of around 340 million.,ENLAY,0.7652539014816284,0.5305075231239338,Positive
We had net lower incentives because our incentives are going progressively down or 100 million. Net of all these items FX and recurring items EBITDA would have been increased by 14.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Now we will move to conventional generation and trading. Im on Page 23 where you can see that ordinary EBITDA increased by around 40 driven by trading activities and reached 2.2 billion. Conventional generation is flat at around 1.6 billion.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Net of nonrecurring items booked in the period the performance would have recorded a minus 5. So the main operating moving parts were as follows 22 contraction in volumes with a negligible impact on our results due to the low materiality associated with two thermal assets around 100 million negative impact associated with the regulation of the highlands in Spain and FX depreciation for around 140 million. These items were partially offset by the positive contribution of efficiencies for 130 million mainly in Italy and Spain.,ENLAY,0.0162260830402374,-0.9675490066701214,Negative
On the other side trading activities impacted also by the dynamics associated with the COVID19 have been the key driver of the doubledigit increase in this business segment contributing for around 600 million mainly thanks to the management of our gas portfolio for around 230 million the managing of the short position in Spain that impacted positively for 190 million and a positive contribution for around 135 million associated with trading activities mainly in Italy.,ENLAY,0.9240571856498718,0.8481142807688002,Positive
Lets now take a look at our infrastructure network and Im on Slide 24. Ordinary EBITDA for networks stood at 7.7 billion decreasing 6 versus last year. In the European countries EBITDA increased by 2 demonstrating once again the resiliency of our European networks which have been supported by solid regulatory frameworks. In LatAm despite the recovery in demand recorded in the second half of the year the operating performance has been negatively impacted by FX and volumes contraction mainly in Brazil.,ENLAY,0.8788018822669983,0.7576036200544953,Positive
As said in the previous releases discussion with regulators in LatAm are ongoing and we expect other actions to be taken to offset the economic impact. The main moving parts of the period have been the following currency devaluation 500 million of impact volume contraction in LatAm with an effect of roughly 200 million mainly in Brazil 100 million associated with losses.,ENLAY,0.2396582067012787,-0.5206844929960328,Negative
There are losses not manageable because of the stop of downing activities in many countries in Latin America. And on the other side an increase of roughly 300 million in EBITDA related to new investments in digitization and improved service quality mainly in Italy and Spain. The reversal of the provision in Spain impacted the ordinary EBITDA for around 180 million while last year EBITDA was positively impacted by the regulatory settlement in Argentina for 140 million.,ENLAY,0.0202122032642364,-0.959576761470295,Negative
And now we can move on retail on Slide number 25. EBITDA for the retail business came in at 3.2 billion with a slight decline versus previous year despite the extreme conditions experienced in 2020 and associated with the COVID19. Notwithstanding the challenging environment the group continued to expand its free market customer base by adding 200000 new customers over the last 12 months and progressed as well in the costreduction effort with the OpEx per customer down 7.,ENLAY,0.9981510639190674,0.9963021256340299,Positive
Looking closely at the EBITDA of the free and regulated market free market EBITDA declined for around 180 million or 6 yearonyear and this is mainly attributable to a temporary loan position driven by a sharp contraction in volumes in Italy and Spain. In Italy EBITDA remained flat yearonyear recovering from the negative result recorded in the nine months driven by a pickup of volumes in the B2B segment in the last quarter of the year with average unitary margins for both B2B and B2C broadly unchanged.,ENLAY,0.9473092555999756,0.8946184483876516,Positive
In Iberia EBITDA declined by 29 or more than 200 million driven mainly by the already commented temporary long position impact. In Romania retail EBITDA increased by 40 million or two times. Regulated market EBITDA increased by 6 yearonyear or around 40 million. And finally we recorded efficiencies for 65 million both in the free and regulated market mainly in Italy.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Now we have gone through business drivers and now we can move to the financial management section. We are on Slide 26. And as you can see ordinary group net income came in at 5.2 at the top guidance range. And now we can show in the next slides detailed item that has supported the growth in the earning during 2020.,ENLAY,0.9997650384902954,0.9995300767004947,Positive
And we move on Page 27 where you can see that as said the 5.2 billion result was driven to  by lower DA financial expenses and a reduction in minorities interest which more than offset the normalization of the tax rate at 28 versus 23 of the previous year in which we accounted oneoff  a positive oneoff from the tax items.,ENLAY,0.8182141780853271,0.6364281394649383,Positive
DA declined versus previous year as a consequence of a lower depreciation in Italy Iberia and Chile thanks to the coal impairments which more than offset the increase in bad debt accruals due to COVID19 pandemic and investment deployed. Reduction in financial expenses as already commented in the previous releases is the result of a reduction of cost of debt. Results from equity investments stood at 134 million.,ENLAY,0.0702747404575347,-0.8594516274044679,Negative
The remarkable swing visvis last year is attributable to the negative impact of around 90 million from JMB unwinding in the U.S. recorded in 2019 and improving results of other nonconsolidated companies primarily open fiber. Taxes as said increased by around 600 million driven by higher earning before tax and the recognition in 2019 of the deferred tax assets in U.S. Argentina and Brazil.,ENLAY,0.1965065002441406,-0.6069879573511824,Negative
Minorities decreased by 21 reflecting the continued simplification effort and operating dynamics in Latin America. And now we move to the cash flow. We are on Page 28. FFO as said stands at 11.5 broadly in line versus previous year. Recovering almost entirely the negative impact related to COVID19. This result highlights the resiliency of the group and its cash generation capability.,ENLAY,0.9821150302886964,0.9642300392568348,Positive
In more details the dynamics underlying the FFO evolution can be summarized as follow EBITDA in line change in provision which increased by around 30 million mainly due to higher bad debt accruals for COVID19. On working capital its worth to highlight that we have almost fully recovered the 2 billion impact due to the pandemic as shown during the first half results call. This leaves us only 400 million negative delta working capital at the end of 2020 which will be reabsorbed in early 2021. Then we had lower taxes paid mainly due to advance set in tax payment lower financial charges paid mainly thanks to lower cost of debt.,ENLAY,0.0033300817012786,-0.9933410247212797,Negative
Free cash flow stood at 1.3 billion confirming the ability of the group to cover the capital expenditure with the operating cash generation. And now on Page 29 we have a look on the net debt level. Net debt is equal to 45.4 billion well below the level communicated at the Capital Market Day mainly thanks to the positive FX impact from the devaluation of local currencies and the different timing of hybrid bond equity and equity accounting conversion.,ENLAY,0.9808387756347656,0.9616775284275583,Positive
Changes are driven by the positive free cash flow of 1.3 dividends paid for 4.7 billion cash outflows related to equities swaps performed of Enel Amricas and Enel Chile hybrid bonds accounted as equity and positive impact from FX of about 2.3 billion the reduction in gross debt from 61.5 to 4.59 is attributable to the accounting provided bonds as equity while the reduction in cash in the period is related to the financing of 2020 activities performed in late 2019.,ENLAY,0.0473795235157012,-0.9052420885813766,Negative
And before the closing remarks lets take a deeper look into our liquidity position and forthcoming debt maturities. Im now on Page 30. And you can see our total liquidity as of December stood at nearly 25 billion of which 6 billion in cash on hand and the remaining 18.6 billion in readily available committed credit lines.,ENLAY,0.9905794858932496,0.9811589605563646,Positive
Level of liquidity covers 1.7x the debt maturing throughout 2021 2023 plan period amounting to 14.9 billion net of shortterm debt that is routinely rolled over. Our credit metrics show a stable level of leverage notwithstanding the extremely adverse impact of cash dynamics deriving from COVID19 with a net debttoEBITDA ratio at 2.5x and FFO net debt at 25.,ENLAY,0.243351548910141,-0.5132978041754985,Negative
The strength of our credit metrics is further testified by current trading levels and outlooks which reflects the solidity of our credit profile even in the current discretionary. In this regards it is good to highlight that in January this year the group has been upgraded to Baa1 from Baa2 by Moodys. And in February Standard  Poors widened the proportional adjusted FFO to debt range by 100 basis points in light of a health position as one of the most resilient utility in the sector.,ENLAY,0.9540778398513794,0.9081556249592453,Positive
And now I hand over to Francesco for the closing remarks. Francesco.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Alberto. So gentlemen ladies we have experienced an extreme and foreseeable scenario. Headwinds came from all over the places ranging from macro variables to operating dynamics. Despite this challenging environment we have been able to deliver a very solid operating and financial performance with a 9 growth in net ordinary income. This confirms once again the sustainability of the business model we have. This has been able to deliver an outstanding growth level even against sudden disruptions.,ENLAY,0.9986661076545716,0.9973322137190188,Positive
Our solid operating deployment across all the business lines positions us as a leader in the utility space a renewable super major that can rely on a resilient and digitized network which will be the backbone of the energy transition of the future supporting also the increasing electrification of consumption. This opens up new business opportunities that will enhance the value to our customers and shareholders.,ENLAY,0.9990022778511048,0.9980045545128315,Positive
Our highly digitized and platformbased business has allowed us to act promptly and to take proactive measures to protect our people first and ensure that at the same time business continuity. I have to underline here the extremely professional behavior of all our workforce that made all this possible. The delivery recorded in 2020 coupled with the managerial actions we put in place to cope with this exceptional year have generated further value that resulted in a top quartile performance of the utility sector with a 22 total shareholder return during the 2020 year.,ENLAY,0.9960007071495056,0.9920014095314797,Positive
So thank you for your attention. Lets now open the QA session with Monica leading us in this.,ENLAY,0.9993687868118286,0.998737572871192,Positive

A  Monica Girardi,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Francesco. We will now move to the QA session. Before starting I want to thank all of the analysts who send the question through. We receive them from Goldman Sachs Banca Akros Barclays Morgan Staley Mediobanca Citigroup SocGen Santander Crdit Suisse Equita Capitol Stifel JPMorgan Deutsche Bank Exane UBS and Merrill Lynch. Thank you all.,ENLAY,0.9994280338287354,0.9988560669756334,Positive
I will start from the first one to the CEO. I think hes one of the most popular. So far 2021 has seen some doubt on renewable which led to a rebalancing and selloff of the most exposed names. Can you share with us your view on the sector and our returns going forward,ENLAY,0.9996697902679444,0.999339580142248,Positive
Okay. There are basically two questions here is  two observations. One is the one on the dynamic of prices and competition with one on the lets say share performance of some players. I think there is some technical adjustments that took place. There are some technical adjustments that took place with the rebalancing of the indexes.,ENLAY,0.7902257442474365,0.5804512384243241,Positive
I think the markets seem to have switched quite quickly the sentiment also on the back of some business events that were kind of surprising during the year. I think the key common conclusion deriving from this event is that the returns may not be at par with the expectation and that delivery in terms of capacity commission might not be in line with targets communicated by several players.,ENLAY,0.9199424982070924,0.8398849009781488,Positive
Now let me recall some of the measures some of the messages that we set out when we delivered our Capital Market Day. The first one is that the dimension and the expansion of the space in renewables is such that it can accommodate for all the relevant players today and more. And that it does not really have any threat of becoming congested or crowded space. So there is not an issue on space of growth. And we didnt see any change during the 2020 year. Prices will go down over time and this is something that we have also clearly stated.,ENLAY,0.0043209493160247,-0.9913592883105806,Negative
It is  has always been our view. And this clearly will shave off some of the expected returns of some players. But the access to customers the platform of the development the management of the assets and the efficiency of the organization so that means the competitiveness and the size and the focus of the organization will determine the capability of any player to deliver on the expected returns.,ENLAY,0.1740882098674774,-0.6518245648292094,Negative
The adoption of an integrated business model and a multitechnology integrated business model allows to better absorb external shocks to optimize the risk return profile. I think you will see that even more evidently when you start to see and it is beginning to show the divergence between pure players and integrated companies.,ENLAY,0.0537396073341369,-0.8925219133626899,Negative
So we believe the market is getting this logic is getting also the protective mix of activities that the group has. And therefore it is not a surprise that we did not see the same trend in our share when compared to other peers or other players that have not the same risk profile.,ENLAY,0.8305444121360779,0.661088622265233,Positive
Overall I think the story is still very solid. There is a trend competitiveness in renewals. Its always been our view and its now showing maybe more clearly than before. And therefore some say some companies might get a little bit penalized by that.,ENLAY,0.1879275739192962,-0.6241458202277543,Negative
Okay. We move to a completely different business but again a really popular question open fiber. Francesco can you share with us some update when the transaction with Macquarie is expected to be finalized And whats the stake that you expect to sell,ENLAY,0.9869773387908936,0.9739546620575559,Positive
The transaction is going to be finalized. It is going to be between 40 to 50 maximum in the next few months or weeks and months this is going to be basically completed. To where do we stand The discussions are now being held between Macquarie the buyer of our share and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti CDP the other shareholder and the discussions are about the governance. So what kind of governance the two players want to have going forward.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Lets say that this is not rocket science. Its a governance about  a company that has one infrastructure as a mission. It is in one country Italy and the shareholders are 2 out of which one has a consolidating stake. So lets say its governance 101 for  as far as this is concerned and it will not take that much to be finalized. We expect therefore the transaction by  to be certainly closed by yearend.,ENLAY,0.7748026847839355,0.5496051011115914,Positive
Of course we will update you as soon as this is clear as soon as the last steps are completed. Again this is a very clear example of how much we can create value when we implement a stewardship model in this kind of infrastructure place.,ENLAY,0.9999966621398926,0.9999933242758061,Positive
Okay. We still stay with you Francesco. Merger of EGP LatAm.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sorry let me just add one thing.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Just to preempt another question that will come up eventually that is the change of government hasnt changed a little bit the outlook of this deal to come through No. We did not get any signal that this still is an item of discussion at all in the present situation at the present government. So there is no signals on that okay So that we dont get a question on this.,ENLAY,0.0024232268333435,-0.9951547355382059,Negative
Fair enough. So we moved to the simplification of Enel Amricas. So merger of EGP and Enel Amricas once the PTO will be completed what are the next steps you envisage for the perimeter of Amricas Will there be any disposals,ENLAY,0.9964417815208436,0.9928835587999578,Positive
I think as soon as we finished with the PTO we will sit with the residual minority shareholders and define what are the key strategic options that Amricas has to maximize value creation going forward One of the many options is also to be more selective in terms of the geographies where we want to continue to operate in Latin America in the light of their growth perspective their stability and the potential creation of value that we can pursue in different geographies.,ENLAY,0.9999881386756896,0.9999762773372394,Positive
Based on this we will decide having listened also of course to all the minority shareholders. And therefore we will proceed to simplify maybe also the geographical positioning in the four countries that are today part of Enel Amricas. I said four but its wrong. They are actually seven because there are three minor countries in Central America that are now part of the portfolio of the country. So there are seven countries.,ENLAY,0.0119381844997406,-0.9761248088626915,Negative
Okay. We move to the CFO for another really popular question. Currencies were a major headwind in 2020 and are still showing weakness. In light of the gap between your scenario and the forward curves what is the expected impact for 2021 There is any clear risk to the guidance,ENLAY,0.954522430896759,0.9090448075799986,Positive
Yes we are. Sorry. For 2020 yes we  it was the main headwind we had 1 billion of impact. So there is  so we recovered the COVID impact but we will leave a 1 billion impact on FX. First month of the year some signs of weakness still present in FX currencies with some signs of different win to move mainly in Brazil which headwinds had been more impacted by some things and not by the general scenario Its too early to say because the first two months vaccination in progress.,ENLAY,0.7955056428909302,0.5910110420054449,Positive
So we think that we will have a clear view of the overall impact looking at the second half of the year and not in the first two months of this year. A pure marktomarket now may so are applying 300 million 350 million impact that we think will not stay along the year. But on the other side I said we have many party movements in our profit and loss mainly the good results of our stewardship model that can  so Id say its not easy but can cover some headwinds if at the end we will have some impact from FX.,ENLAY,0.2408132553100586,-0.518374394401547,Negative
Okay. So I guess the bottom line is that no the guidance is not at risk. Now we still  another one on guidance actually. Net debt is well below the guidance provided for the year. Will this improvement carry over to the 2021 2023 net debt figures,ENLAY,0.9548554420471193,0.9097108302776997,Positive
Well the general answer is no. So we think we have  the trend of our debt is fully in line with what we have presented for the three years plan. The main driver of changes in 2020 is based on sort of the timing of the hybrid bond equity accounting because in our projections we included only 600 million because we didnt include the concepts of solicitation that we launched at the end of 2020 that occurred.,ENLAY,0.0723228752613067,-0.8553553553553555,Negative
So  but we had projecting these solicitation for 2021. So its only the main part is a timing difference then we have some saving but not in the numbers that you see. And so savings better results is in the range of 200 million 300 million and the rest is timing difference on hybrid accounting.,ENLAY,0.1919598579406738,-0.6160812473781392,Negative
Okay. Alberto still with you on working capital dynamics which are the main drivers of the strong improvement in working capital from the nine months is the reduction fully associated with the reabsorption of the negative COVID effects,ENLAY,0.9956399202346802,0.9912798352717371,Positive
Well yes. First of all yes. So the vast majority is the absorption of COVID effect that we have shown in the first half. Well I think a combination of two things one some new actions that we put in place to recover mainly so moving to digital payments a huge part of our customer base along the year. And this is one of the main part.,ENLAY,0.9995735883712769,0.9991471762342312,Positive
And the second is that some regulators maybe so focused in Brazil that has  was the more  the most active in this. So they gave us some aids in financial aids. So the impact in Brazil accounted for almost 600 million and was  so the main action to solve the financial problems of the Brazilian distributors that was related to the delay in payments for customers are caused by the lockdown and others. These two main things allow us to recover almost in full the impact of working capital for COVID.,ENLAY,0.0312684774398803,-0.9374641999388934,Negative
Okay. Still on the COVID19 analysts are asking if we can provide a breakdown of the COVID19 impacts on business segments.,ENLAY,0.9432085752487184,0.8864170827967424,Positive
Okay. So first of all as said so the 1 billion impact of FX so its not directly connected to COVID but so its clearly related to this. Out of this impact as said we had a 730 million impact on EBITDA because of COVID.,ENLAY,0.9791743755340576,0.9583487262420214,Positive
As I said in the presentation 600 million are mainly related with the contraction volumes and 130 million related with other things and the main are losses on the network front. So the time in which we cant act against frauds. So fraud we had a huge increase in frauds then another 60 million 70 million was a delay in the development.,ENLAY,0.039529263973236,-0.9209426170245512,Negative
But on the other side we can have also  we had also positive impact because we have a huge decrease in OpEx. I dont know travel expenses and other kind of OpEx that was main related with the new situation for COVID.,ENLAY,0.7612593770027161,0.5225184694042619,Positive
When it comes to countries I would say that Italy was resilient at all so the impact is 0 with different moving parts that bring the country to these results. Iberia impacted the more roughly 100 million mainly because of this long position in the hedge contracts that  so its the oneoff effect of the sharp contraction of demand. And the rest is Latin America. And Latin America is both the volume contraction and on the other side bad debt and stop of downing activities.,ENLAY,0.8129761219024658,0.6259520208549625,Positive
When it comes to the business lines the most impacted lines are the lines that work on volumes. So retail mainly for the loan position in Italy Spain and distribution mainly for the demand contraction in Latin America where  so regulators so the regulatory framework dont give any kind of shed to the reduction in volumes.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. Francesco we go back to you on a  with a question on renewables. So renewable addition came in at 3100 megawatts but were impacted by COVID. Can you remind us what would have been the level of new capacity in absence of the pandemic And what do you expect for 2021 in terms of delivery Is there any further risk from COVID you see now,ENLAY,0.8058557510375977,0.6117112706370775,Positive
Yes. No. So lets see the additional built that we missed to put into the 2020 year is around 800 megawatts as we said. So we would have been slightly below 4000 megawatts without any COVID impact if we have no COVID impact.,ENLAY,0.0575067400932312,-0.8849876433537265,Negative
Now what happens during 2021 is that yes this 800 megawatts are rolled into the 2021 target. We expect to recover fully during 2021. And then therefore to go above the 5000megawatt threshold quite substantially during the 2021 year. So 21 year will not only recover the delay of 2020 but also accelerate further compared to 2020.,ENLAY,0.9091325402259828,0.8182649721294477,Positive
Frankly no we dont see any residual risk so COVID in term  as far as installations are concerned. You might recall that I mentioned these facts at the beginning of the pandemic that we anticipated some slowdown on permitting because of public administrations around the world being confined at home or not really as effective or as productive.,ENLAY,0.8496062159538269,0.6992122526241855,Positive
If you can use this word on the permitting phase and therefore some impact on further down the road. So far we dont see an impact in 22. We are assessing if there is anything on 23 so no impact at this point. We think this is over.,ENLAY,0.0344979465007782,-0.9310052579672682,Negative
Okay. Again with you Francesco you have shown meaningful progress in 2020 on phasing out generation from coal. What is the status of discussion with governments in shutting down coal plants especially in Italy,ENLAY,0.9370697736740112,0.8741394723293021,Positive
So you know that we have a commitment to phase out coal. And during the CMD we said 27 as the end date. And we are working basically with screed operators governments local communities in order to do this by then. This is  lets face  lets understand what we are talking about. We are talking about disconnecting plants from the networks okay So if you look at phasingout action this is already taking place in a spectacular way.,ENLAY,0.9996041655540466,0.9992083306362216,Positive
We went down 65 on coal this year 2020. This will continue to go  to come. So the production will be extremely marginal going forward but the symbolic and substantial disconnection from the grid of an infrastructure requires an agreement from network operators that need to be lets say comfortable with the fact that if this capacity is withdrawn from the system the system can withstand shocks of all kinds.,ENLAY,0.1882933378219604,-0.6234142919864012,Negative
So where do we stand with this We have an early shutdown during 2020. We got an early shutdown from Italy  from Italian network operator and authorities to take out the first unit of the Brindisi power plant which is now being dismantled and to take up two out of four units of the Fusina power plant by 2021 which is going on. So this is according to plan. Thats okay. We have discussion in Spain with the phaseout of indiscernible following the decision of closing which has been communicated and has been accepted.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The question today is basically therefore not a question of reducing production. Its basically going to stop way before 2027 but rather making comfortable the operator  network operators thats taking the plants off the grid poses no risk to the stability of the grid itself which is something that we are working at and its something that we are quite confident we can achieve by 2027. So we are in good track in this space. And we are ahead of the curve when you look at the actual production from the existing facilities.,ENLAY,0.9966151714324952,0.9932303388299579,Positive
Okay. We move a little bit to the future. You have made some announcement in hydrogen projects. How do you see the business evolving I think Francesco its for you.,ENLAY,0.9945883750915528,0.9891767437319423,Positive
So this is a little bit more in the future than people would think but anyway. So yes we have a commitment on the green hydrogen front so on hydrogen produced by hydrolysis. And the commitment we have is to  through the implementation of some projects push the boundaries of this technology and drive the evolution of this technology in order to find out if the cost of the electrolyzers can drop a factor of six.,ENLAY,0.9495126008987428,0.8990251416117798,Positive
So it can drop from 1200 per kilowatt to about 200 per kilowatt. This is what it takes coupled with the renewable energy costs. So today we have already reached. This is what it takes to bring green hydrogen at par with the present hydrogen costs. Without that failing that this technology will never really pick up if not for some niches of very specific applications. So our goal is to work with various partners in different countries. We have projects in Italy. We have projects in Spain. The largest one are in Spain.,ENLAY,0.1816780865192413,-0.6366448024778382,Negative
And we have project in Chile and we have projects in the U.S. to use these projects in order to push and get possibly a solution to this cost issue on investment cost issue on the electrolyzers and understand this technology fully. The next 10 years should be enough in order to establish whether this happens.,ENLAY,0.2035589218139648,-0.5928831058043873,Negative
And there are times when this happens and there are times when it does not happen. And you might recall for example that TV panels have done this. Batteries are doing it. But solar  thermal solar generation did not succeed. And there are examples of one and the other kind. So we are engaged in this kind of discovery trip.,ENLAY,0.8028925657272339,0.6057848964839556,Positive
Really clear. So another one for you I think Francesco. Italy has highlighted the country we received more than 190 billion from the EU recovery fund. When should we expect project proposal for the use of these funds to start to come through,ENLAY,0.7536572813987732,0.5073142691339667,Positive
Let me answer also for the other three countries in Europe where we are present which are Spain Greece and Romania. So the deadline that a commission has set has  as a latest possible date the end of April. Some countries like Spain have already advanced their proposals. Some countries like Italy have not yet done the full homework.,ENLAY,0.001462310552597,-0.9970765692452009,Negative
But lets say that within April all the initiatives will have to be presented to the European task force that manages this incredible task of understanding which projects fit and which projects do not fit the logic and the criteria of the EU. To do that the European Union has eight weeks so two months to respond with various feedbacks. And then the European Council needs to have an approval of four weeks. So we think that including a potential prefinancing of 10 member states could get the first money streams within 2021 okay,ENLAY,0.9561812877655028,0.912362523294999,Positive
Im saying this because you need to have  in order for this flow of money to really materialize you need to have to establish the allocation procedures on a competitive basis in respecting all the guidelines on state aid that are important for private players like we are or you need to have regulatory framework changes in order for the same to happen on regulated concessionary businesses as we have also that cannot play on a competitive basis. So there are two parallel tracks that need to be established.,ENLAY,0.0013518333435058,-0.9972975237950825,Negative
All in all I think there are several areas where this can happen. Let me just give you a little bit of a rule of thumb. Its easier to accelerate the pace of project implementation and activity of something that is already moving  that something that already has an entrant on its own. So in other words if we have as we do in many countries a large flow of investment already in some businesses its easier to increase that and therefore be at the early part of the disbursement of these funds. Its less easy to jumpstart something that does not exist.,ENLAY,0.0108135342597961,-0.9783741106832688,Negative
Lets take the hydrogen things. They need to be designed. They need to be permitted and therefore they will be able to capture flows of money sizable flows of money only probably a little later than networks for example or accelerated deployment of digital meters or infrastructure of this case. But because we are in both fields we are optimally positioned to benefit from this flow of money in a uniform way across the different geographies. So we are very confident that this will be quite possible for us.,ENLAY,0.2014365196228027,-0.5971279127168136,Negative
Lets not forget the dimensions that European Unions are facing are looking for are totally in line with our strategy. So renewables electrification networks digital content theyre exactly in line with our strategy. So we think we will benefit from this quite substantially.,ENLAY,0.9957266449928284,0.9914532848914175,Positive
Okay. So we move to the situation in Brazil. Alberto the market is asking if you can share with us the  an update on the situation in Brazil.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. So we have.,ENLAY,0.8676321506500244,0.7352641435051819,Positive
So both  sorry. I divided the question in two because its a little bit long. So the first one is on financial and economic impact in 2020. And the other one is on the  and the other part is on the ongoing discussion with the regulator for the outstanding regulatory issues and if you are confident that we will get to a positive solution.,ENLAY,0.1180078387260437,-0.7639853739651287,Negative
Okay. For the  in the 2020 impact so we had an overall impact coming from Brazil of 730 million 430 million for FX impact and 300 million related with the COVID impact. When it comes with this 300 million the three main items were roughly 6 terawatt of lower demand thats worth around 200 million the said increase in losses for around 50 million and then we have the delay of new renewables projects for around 40 million.,ENLAY,0.9979633092880248,0.9959266161481235,Positive
And then we had another item that is related with the bad debt associated with the fees of downing of roughly 70 million. And these are the main headwinds in our LatAm activities are coming from Brazil. On the other side for the ongoing discussion with the regulator that I remember that is a discussion of the economical restore of the impacts because the financial once they have been restored with the COVID  the Quinta COVID agreement.,ENLAY,0.8242690563201904,0.6485379031526466,Positive
Right now Enel has opened the third phase of public hearing for the discussion of this economic rebalance. Regulatory is going to assess the overall impact suffered by the distribution companies and is still looking into options to restore the impact while avoiding a tariff increase for the final customers.,ENLAY,0.0419259369373321,-0.9161492682393005,Negative
So a solution that now is on the table is to have a recourse of tax clean. So the taxes that are present in Brazil. And this may smoothen the tariff increase making such benefit immediately available. We believe that Enel will respect the concession agreements and the methodology proposed that the public hearing will be improved in order to rebalance the economic situation along 2021.,ENLAY,0.989754557609558,0.9795091030055896,Positive
Okay. Alberto again another really popular question for you that was also asked by BTIG that I forgot to mention before so the cold spell in Texas has impacted several companies operating in the area. Can you provide some more color on your operations there Has there been any economic impact,ENLAY,0.9606621265411376,0.9213242061878477,Positive
Well so first of all the cold spell in Texas affected our wind farms as of  for the majority of the players operating in the area. Main impact was due to the rising of blades. The main components of the towers and for a period of approximately two weeks then we were able to resume operations quickly and so to limit  so the reduction in the production and damages to people or equipment.,ENLAY,0.0033298730850219,-0.9933414419540418,Negative
Now we have filed in March 12 two petitions with the Public Utility Commission of Texas PUCT one asking to reprice the electricity market and a second to receive an North America rights to further appeal the PUCT orders to reprice the market.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So far PUCT has declined to take up the issue for the crisis period. But political pressure to the price is bounding and also it is the recommended action of the independent market monitor. So we continue to look closely as we are asked promptly to push that way to resolve the issue.,ENLAY,0.9723180532455444,0.944636073491617,Positive
But as of today we see a maximum potential economic impact that at a net income level is set to be eligible even if the PUCT actions filed are not successful like we think that in some way they will do. We have some corporate actions insurances and also legal actions that so we are to  in a combining way are putting so the final outcome of this issue not really impacting our overall results.,ENLAY,0.9992157816886902,0.9984315624425186,Positive
Okay. Alberto we still stay with you with a question on inflation. As the market is becoming increasingly concerned about inflationary trends how is your business protected against inflation,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Well yes. So the markets are becoming sensible to do inflation signs that we think that this is not the case. We dont think that we will see any inflation pressures for all the 2021. We are also look forward in 2022 but having said that as for the business our business is well covered by any increase in inflation.,ENLAY,0.9905685186386108,0.9811370260340131,Positive
Network tariffs are adjusted yearly by inflation in almost all the countries. the Generation business in the generation business PPI if we see different types of pricing mechanism. In fact the majority of the PPA are covered index to inflation. And also on the retail business we have. So yearbyyear we can  we adjust our tariff also looking at despite of inflation.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Its clear that potential impact of rising inflation may be on bond yield while we dont see no major issues on the issuance side but also on the stop of that because almost 80 of our debt is at fixed rate or hedged.,ENLAY,0.0999360978603363,-0.8001288772397501,Negative
Okay. Alberto we are receiving lots of messages addressed to you about a clear statement around the guidance for 2021 if you can confirm that you dont see any risk at the targets that we shared with the market back in November.,ENLAY,0.9845551252365112,0.9691102320612861,Positive
We do confirm our target for 2021.,ENLAY,0.7773167490959167,0.5546332327325538,Positive
Okay. Perfect. Well I think its the byproduct but lets open also the discussion around the dividend payment. Francesco if you want to comment if you see any risk to the dividend payment for 2021 Francesco you are on mute,ENLAY,0.9992835521697998,0.9985671034855268,Positive
No. We dont see any risk on dividend payments on the back of the guarantee we gave already in the Capital Market Day on the back of our view as we just said that the guidance needs no change. And on the back that this year would probably be a little better than 2020 where we did not change our dividend policy so no no change.,ENLAY,0.9648464918136596,0.9296929417210469,Positive
Okay. Now we move to a set of questions and we hope to go through quickly around the business. The first one is for the CEO and its about the pipeline which has increased enormously versus last November. If you can provide some color on the underlying dynamics of such a big stepup.,ENLAY,0.979320228099823,0.9586404315474222,Positive
I think we need to get used to this going forward because the ambition of the growth objectives that we have outlined for the decade as such that this gross pipeline needs to start now in order for this to be delivered three five years down the road. So people should not look at the pipeline. And what were doing in the same year because the pipeline is about three five years down the road and what were doing in the year is what the pipeline was three five years ago.,ENLAY,0.9593944549560548,0.918788861506499,Positive
So the pipeline grew because our ambition are of growth and because there is space for growth. And there is an ongoing effort which is not going to stop. This will continue. Today we have a mature pipeline that went up 4000 megawatts in this period. Its about in the few months mostly concentrated in Europe Africa and Oceania.,ENLAY,0.9291887879371644,0.8583774914607356,Positive
The stepup of the earlystage pipeline includes projects in Spain where the growth is now happening in a large space. U.S.A. more than 31 is there Latin America and a little bit in the rest of the world. So this will continue. It looks a lot but if you look at what we have in mind and the kind of growth that is available out there its  I think its just right.,ENLAY,0.8623568415641785,0.724713519044828,Positive
Okay. Again Francesco I think this is for you. In light of the results of the Italian renewable auction which is your view in terms of renewable development in Italy what are your expectations in terms of price evolution,ENLAY,0.9840559363365172,0.9681118536662181,Positive
I think I have anticipated this trend about a year ago. You might recall that I have said Italy tracks Spain with 1.5 years delay because of the slow process of optimization and permitting that separates these two countries. Italy is a little bit  its quite slower in terms of permitting. So there is an inertia that needs to be bridged.,ENLAY,0.0012908577919006,-0.9974194749709815,Negative
And that is shown in the fact that tenders are not full. I mean the capacity is not fully satisfied. And obviously prices are higher. Will this continue No. I think it will be gradually picking up with that delay that we had in mind that is showing now finally in its dimension. But prices will stay higher for the next probably 12 to 18 months. Yes.,ENLAY,0.0804890692234039,-0.8390229576962934,Negative
Okay. Again for you. Comment on the measures approved by the Mexican government which is restricted  restricting access to the wholesale market. Can you share any thought,ENLAY,0.9887151718139648,0.9774303301753582,Positive
We think these measures are wrong. They are against the law. In fact I think the judges in Mexico think the same and they have ruled quite robustly against them. We hope that the governments understand that this is preventing a flow of investment in the country and damaging the trust of investors in the country itself. So we guess this will finally get to the right attention level.,ENLAY,0.1995182037353515,-0.6009645467785281,Negative
I think the decree prevents free market competition. It promotes monopoly and also eventually compromises environmental targets of the Mexican government itself. So I think the supreme cart and the judges have already ruled against this decree on constitutional level. We are ready to go wherever it needs to be done in terms of iteration and rolling.,ENLAY,0.9736177921295166,0.947235552808972,Positive
But clearly this marks a little bit of slowdown on the investment cycle in Mexico which by the way for us was basically idling waiting for this to happen. So were not particularly hit. I might recall that we have a joint venture in Mexico in which we have a minority stake already. So the impact is  on the accounts its small. But I think its a proof that if a country wants to inflict its damage on itself it can. And I hope this ends quickly.,ENLAY,0.97802996635437,0.9560599065184034,Positive
Okay. Alberto we go back to the auctions and we change a country though. Analysts are asking about the auction since Spain that have been awarded at a really low price. What is your view on the underlying economics And if you think that the returns are sustainable at such a low price.,ENLAY,0.0093510448932647,-0.9812990911597558,Negative
Well I have already expressed in other times. So what we think about so the very low price that we see at tenders. First of all so the outcome price has to be assessed because every tender is seeking to have price that is very low and then you have to look at other items that are eaten in the offer that may increase the price. Thats the first for all the tenders in the world.,ENLAY,0.9872170686721802,0.9744341221059096,Positive
Second is its clearly that the timing which a lot of developers is only this way to develop. Its clear the tenders will be very very very competitive. And because  so everyone is seeking to have these PPAs to have a higher level of leverage coming from banks and reducing the level of equity.,ENLAY,0.975182056427002,0.9503640832686922,Positive
And sometimes so the  with faith in the future that may  so at the end of the PPA may say in the business plan that the next 10 years after the business plan will be the years that will set the clear return on projects. We dont think that is the case. We think that the prices in renewable will go down so there is no future in which still in the second part of the useful life of plant you will see prices that will be higher than today.,ENLAY,0.7782708406448364,0.5565414169677596,Positive
We think that with a spot price that is in the range of 45 offering 24 is a strange offer because at the end you are losing 20 per megawatt hour in the year in which you have this difference. And you are also hoping that it will stay also for a longer time. And that we saw offers by far down versus the average levelized cost of energy that today is an average in the country in the case in Spain.,ENLAY,0.0331553220748901,-0.9336905084195783,Negative
Having said that we participate in the tender and we lose tender because we offer prices that are in line with our levelized cost of energy. But the real development that we see in countries in which we are integrated is not to tenders but is developing capacity and integrating the capacity with the demand offered by our retail segment.,ENLAY,0.933468222618103,0.8669363659240996,Positive
Okay. Again for you Alberto. Given the extreme weather events that can occur like Texas how is the resource availability in 2021 Could you please provide the sensitivity or resource availability for 2021,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Well year started very well. In the past we have mainly Europe have very high level of. And also Chile is recovering the very dry situation of the last year while wind and solar resources are aligned with whats expected. So today so we  clearly we do not foresee any impact coming from resource and ability while  so we are now looking at having some better results because of the result of the first two months are encouraging.,ENLAY,0.7700031995773315,0.5400061249769479,Positive
Okay. There was a question for Francesco about the coal phaseout that we expect for 2021. But if Im not wrong Francesco you explained the road map quite clearly before. So I would jump this while for Alberto there is a question around the hedging level for 2021 and 2022 and if you  if we see any impact from prices volatility,ENLAY,0.9978069067001344,0.9956138107858963,Positive
Well for the hedging for 2021 we have already completed more or less the hedging activities. We are now at 85 for Italy 97 for Spain. And we have an edge price that is stable versus the previous year. While for 2022 we stand at 41 for Italy and 57 in Spain.,ENLAY,0.996274709701538,0.9925494149621812,Positive
Remember that we  our hedge is on an integrated position. So we cover at the same time production and retail activities. So its for everyone to look on how the integrated margin is covered. And as I said so now we are working on integrated margins stable along the years.,ENLAY,0.9996821880340576,0.9993643756892536,Positive
Okay. We move to networks Francesco. What is that in Italy Here we go again. Will happen at the end of 2021 with the current interest rate environment and low BTP bond spread how can the regulator keep the current 5.9 WACC level included in your plan assumption,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Two good question in fact. But we think from one side there is this. On the other side there is the fact that distribution companies in general network investment is the first kick of the party of the recovery fund and the investment. So the regulator in general will be extremely careful not to discourage a very high level of investment in distribution networks required by the energy transition.,ENLAY,0.8093547821044922,0.6187093369420391,Positive
I have to also recall that the regulator during the last regulatory negotiation indicated that they wanted to switch from RABbased to a RAB Totex mix during this next the one that will start now regulatory period. So we are quite positive that there would not be a drastic change. The first consultation document will be issued in May. The negotiation will start at the end of 21.,ENLAY,0.0335153341293334,-0.9329704838815237,Negative
So we think that we are not that concerned in the returns where we are more curious to see what is the mix of the two  what this migration from RAB to Totex that they have in mind how they want to carry that out in the context of the big push that the government is now throwing into the network development and infrastructure development for the next electrification phase in Italy.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So we are widely optimistic that this  the end results of lets say the equivalent of 5.9 WACC can be achieved perhaps with different tools.,ENLAY,0.9872817993164062,0.9745635834715267,Positive
Okay. We move to different type of question really popular one again. We have heard  and I think Francesco its naturally for you. We have heard you were looking into the acquisition of WPD in the UK.,ENLAY,0.9518146514892578,0.9036292455370698,Positive
Can you explain the rationale of that type of transaction How does it fit with your strategy And I would add if we are interested  if it means that we are interested into potential MA in Europe,ENLAY,0.998923659324646,0.9978473173661933,Positive
We have not offered for WPD. And this is  we did not present a bid. We looked into it because we of course are interested in distribution networks around the world in the EU in particular. Lets say UK was in the EU when we had this thing in our mind but it doesnt matter. It is still a very important part of Europe.,ENLAY,0.9698857069015504,0.9397713779040446,Positive
When we looked at it and we saw the way it was managed and also the way in which the regulator in the UK is looking at these kind of assets we decided not to offer which doesnt mean that we cannot do that in other opportunities in Europe or elsewhere and when they will come along. So this time we passed because they were not  it was not interesting enough. And by the way we saw the UK as increasingly risky place to go.,ENLAY,0.0697908401489257,-0.8604194285985404,Negative
Okay. Considering the exposure dynamics in LatAm.,ENLAY,0.982994794845581,0.9659895694193659,Positive
If I can add.,ENLAY,0.8705826997756958,0.7411652452738555,Positive
Sure.,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
It looks like the winner is a UK company. So I think for them the risk is different. The risk profile of the UK is a little bit more palatable than for a company that does not sit in the UK.,ENLAY,0.1403262913227081,-0.7193484421661152,Negative
Okay. Now considering the exposure  and another question in relation to networks but its LatAm. So Alberto I think given its volumes its for you. So considering the exposure to volumes dynamic dynamics in LatAm and the impact recorded in 2020 how is 2021 so far And what are your expectation for the year,ENLAY,0.9968292713165284,0.9936585388532515,Positive
Well we saw first level of recovery of demands already in the second half of 2020 and now also the first month of 2021. So our expectations is that energy demand in 2021 will go back to 2019 levels. Right now for the numbers we have on February we can say that we see a demand that is in line what with February last year. So the level of demand that was before the starting of the lockdown for COVID. So this is encouraging because we think that this trend is  there are no other fell out of COVID without further lockdown is progressively recovering.,ENLAY,0.1049213707447052,-0.7901583255281004,Negative
Okay. I think we move to retail now. Francesco for you. Its a kind of a recurring recurring question. The end of the regulated tariff in Italy has been postponed further. Whats the impact  what is the impact you see from this on your business plan,ENLAY,0.0489384233951568,-0.9021242869641108,Negative
This is as you know very well those that follow this saga since now 4 years 3.5 years you know very well that I have always maintained that every new government has this wildcard to postpone the tariff. And this again has happened. I think  by the way it happened with the old government before they left. So I mean its even more the cooler.,ENLAY,0.0128252804279327,-0.9743506159488059,Negative
So I think this is not a surprise for anyone. I think it is not a big game changer. For us weve always factored in in the next three years somehow this thing but we have always kept our strategy of gradually and inexorably I would say grow our customer base getting customers out of the related tariffs while this regulated tariff was in place and this is now continuing.,ENLAY,0.7924620509147644,0.5849238544248667,Positive
So I think it is mildly positive going  looking at the track record that we have in this field it is very stable. Looking at how the market looks it is changing nothing in terms of competitive pressure. It is prolonging the actual situation which for us I would say is a wellknown territory in which we will continue to implement the strategy of growth that we have so far successfully pursued.,ENLAY,0.99668687582016,0.9933737476907658,Positive
So I see a very very small impact in terms of economic returns but a very stable continuity in the growth of our customer base.,ENLAY,0.9816367030143738,0.9632733841379786,Positive
Okay. We move  we stay in Italy and we add Spain. Alberto this question is for you. Analysts are asking if you can provide a little bit of granularity around power volumes sold to B2B and B2C customers for Italy and Spain in 2020 of course.,ENLAY,0.9280351996421814,0.8560703134955845,Positive
Okay. So in Italy power sold in 2020 had been down overall by 3. B2B segment was down 6. That it means roughly 3 terawatt hours. In B2C was up by 7.,ENLAY,0.0620256662368774,-0.8759497856794511,Negative
That roughly is 1 terawatt hour more. In Iberia volumes are down overall 11. B2B contraction was up 13. We are talking about roughly 8 terawatt hours with B2C down 4. Also here is less than 1 terawatt hour. Overall the contraction of industrial activities is the main driver for the contraction. And now we see a progressive recovery.,ENLAY,0.8828109502792358,0.7656217608581548,Positive
Worth mentioning that the reduction in the B2B segment is the  as the less marginality in the overall portfolio of our selling thats why  so the increase in B2C with a higher level of marginality covered almost entirely the reduction in marginality coming from B2B. And the only impact really impact that we had on retail in 2020 was the long position the temporary long position that was created by the sharp contraction in the B2B demand following the lockdown.,ENLAY,0.2779771983623504,-0.44404646399406444,Negative
Okay. So you spent a few words on the margins which I think is also answering another question associated with B2B and B2C for Italy and Spain. So we move to a question which asked the latest observation around demand in Italy and Spain. So have you seen recently any recovery What are the residual risks associated with COVID,ENLAY,0.9828912019729614,0.9657823835506341,Positive
Yes. So in the first two months we know a big bump but we are observing a little trend of recovery that started in the second half of last year with some stop and go along the second part of 2020. Today we see the electricity demand is flat in Italy and with minus 1 in Spain. So this is a steady recovery of demand that we observed along the month.,ENLAY,0.0446310937404632,-0.9107389514082381,Negative
Okay. I think we are approaching the two last questions and are both for the CFO. One is on the hybrid. So we move to the financials. So you have 2.1 billion hybrid bonds still accounted as debt. Are you going to change the maturity to perpetual and accounting as equity from now onwards Will all the hybrids be accounted as equity,ENLAY,0.7741326093673706,0.548264949479669,Positive
Well so we have started the process last year as you know and so we are looking to continue to do so also in the next year. We will use depending on the overall impact consent solicitation like we did for the first time in the last year or so we will wait the refinancing time for other. So it will depend on the market condition. And so we will evaluate accordingly with the best approach. At the beginning of this month I remember that we have just issued the new hybrids for 2.25 billion and these new hybrids will be fully accounted as equity.,ENLAY,0.9999899864196776,0.9999799728274181,Positive
Okay. Last one the expectation of a less favorable interest rate environment can change or accelerate the deployment of your financial strategy,ENLAY,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Well we constantly monitor the evolution of economic and financial environment. To give you an example we took for the hybrid bonds a clear wind between 2x of some tool bullets in the market. The window was very clear. And so we get a very very low level of cost. So the hybrid we issued had the overall cost of 1.7.,ENLAY,0.9440689086914062,0.8881377507077162,Positive
I think the lowest level of cost for a hybrid bond. And so we will do it also looking forward. I think that a lot of windows will be ready to refinance the debt. And so I would say so we will  I think we will have another one year or one. Five years of levelplaying fields to finance or refinance the debt but we worked that way.,ENLAY,0.9997552037239076,0.999510407155995,Positive
So the final answer is I think that we dont have any kind of impact for the foreseeable future but also tactically speaking we are working on windows being ready to do something soon as the condition are so easy for us.,ENLAY,0.9725157618522644,0.9450314909407442,Positive
Okay. I think this concludes the list of questions that we received. So I want to thank our CEO and CFO and I want to thank all of the participants to this call reminding all of them that we are open to any followup they may desire. Just give us a call or drop us an email. Thank you so much.,ENLAY,0.996980369091034,0.9939607345823853,Positive
Thank you Monica. Thank you everyone else. Thank you for the attention and the questions.,ENLAY,0.9987444877624512,0.9974889740282142,Positive

With that I would like to turn it over to Ric.,DM,0.7513755559921265,0.5027508156006428,Positive
Thank you Arjun. Good day everyone. We are excited to welcome you to our first earnings call as a public company. The past several months has been transformational for Desktop Metal. In the fourth quarter alone we completed the transaction between China and Desktop Metal started trading on the New York Stock Exchange and began shipping several new products core to our longterm roadmap ending the year with over 595 million on the balance sheet to fund our growth strategy.,DM,0.9994487762451172,0.998897551833124,Positive
I would like to start today by providing an overview of our business for those that are new to our story about some of the key milestones we achieved in the fourth quarter and discuss some of our strategy going forward. After my remarks James will cover our evolution to a public company discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and provide guidance for 2021.,DM,0.9955406188964844,0.9910812324769691,Positive
First an overview of our business starting with our investment highlights on Slide 3. Desktop Metal is the only pureplay additive manufacturing 2.0 company. We are pioneering a new generation of additive manufacturing technologies focused on the production of enduse products to help businesses make high performance products faster more sustainably in a cost and volume competitive with conventional manufacturing processes. The additive manufacturing market is a significant and growing opportunity thats expected to go from roughly 12 billion in 2019 to about 146 billion by 2030. This 11x growth is being propelled by a shift from prototyping and tooling into mass production applications and the industry has strong secular tailwind around onshoring and supply chain flexibility.,DM,0.7874239087104797,0.5748475640103603,Positive
We have a growing portfolio of additive manufacturing 2.0 solutions focused on volume production of end use parts that we think has industry leading price performance and capabilities across the portfolio with over 190 materials qualified across polymers metals ceramics composites and biocompatible resins. Our products include some of the largest and fastest DLP systems in the market with the Envision One HT and the Xtreme 8K and we have got the fastest metal printer in the market with a Production System P50. Its about 100 times faster than product generation technology cycles are part of the future. We have also got a series of developing businesses in composites and biofabrication that we are going to expand as I will discuss shortly.,DM,0.9999947547912598,0.9999895095762668,Positive
This portfolio is backed by differentiated technology modes. That includes printers software materials in over 260 patents issued or pending. We have a second major mode around distribution. And we now have over 250 partners in 68 countries around the world. We are doubling down on a combination of horizontal and vertical focus. We are the channel to go after a variety of markets. We have got a solid dental and jewelry business and we will continue to expand our focus into verticals such as healthcare automotive aerospace and oil and gas. We have got a very compelling financial profile. The products I highlighted earlier each have high margin recurring revenue streams from receivables and service which generate a multiple of the upfront revenue and gross profit over the lifetime of the system.,DM,0.9934685230255128,0.9869370382648937,Positive
On the whole we anticipate significant gross margin improvements and operating leverage as we scale revenue over time. And finally we believe there is a significant inorganic upside potential in the business. And we have got a team with experience executing transactions. We have ended the year with a very robust liquidity profile. And we expect to use this to fund organic activities but also generate a return as we add strategic capabilities to the business in line with a strategy focused on enabling killer apps for additive.,DM,0.9970240592956544,0.9940481150437088,Positive
Taking a step back you look at the additive manufacturing industry as a whole on Slide 4 today a small percentage of the spend in a program goes to design prototypes tooling and jigs and fixtures. These use cases has traditionally been the focus of additive manufacturing. This actually used to be an industry called rapid prototyping but the vast majority of the spending in a program really goes to the end use parts in production.,DM,0.9489320516586304,0.8978640424394861,Positive
Turning to Slide 5 if you take additive manufacturing or AM to mass production there is four key hurdles each has a high bar given the maturity of conventional manufacturing processes. In the polymer space for example surface finish has traditionally been a barrier. I mean parts that look and feel like end use parts or the polymer AM has created this hurdle but for a long time the parts didnt have the required accuracy. Today there are residents available that fully cured during printing. So you can achieve the finish and accuracy needed to go to market with AM parts. Material properties is also a recent area of innovation with multicolor resins which now enable making parts from materials that level or exceed widely available thermoplastics. And finally beads have gradually been increasing since about 2011 primarily through continuous printing which we patented and they are now reaching a point where you can use photopolymer AM production in high volumes. The story is very similar in the metal side where over time technology advances have cleared each of these bars. The key hurdle we at DM are now addressing the speed and cost where throughput has historically emitted the use of metal AM because parts and systems have not been cost effective.,DM,0.0961918830871582,-0.8076173112495608,Negative
Turning to Slide 6 we are focused on print processes with productivity that continues to improve over time writing semiconductor scaling loss. In metals we have got the fastest binder jetting systems in the market. The engine that drives the throughput is inkjet which has doubled in throughput every roughly 18 to 24 months. For the past 20 years by improving nozzle density and droplet firing frequency whereas vectorbased print processes typically require more time or more cost to scale through. An areawide process that gains efficiencies over time like our proprietary single pass jetting technology drives the economics of additive down the cost curve to make it competitive with conventional manufacturing and volumes up to hundreds of thousands of units per day and even larger volumes as the new generation print engine is introduced.,DM,0.982075333595276,0.9641506458226718,Positive
On Slide 7 we see the same thing happening in photopolymers with the move to UV diodes as a light source for curing. EnvisionTECs photopolymer printers have scaled speed roughly every 24 months as new generations of diodes come out. Now you have got their new patented approach called projection arrays which multiplies improvements in power output enables sprint speeds to scale it even faster. Resolution has also had scaling with rapid advancements in underlying image projection technology. This allows you to have larger built platforms with more parts. The result of all this is that our photopolymer printers can now use these improvements in power and resolution to shift further the cost curve making atscale printing of end use polymer parts viable. With this focus on technologies that ride thirdparty improvements in efficiency and power we have the wind behind our sales and we anticipate growing more competitive with conventional manufacturing each year.,DM,0.9999708533287048,0.9999417066226641,Positive
Turning to Slide 8 additive manufacturing 2.0 or AM 2.0 represents this next generation of technologies that enables volume production of end use parts with finish accuracy properties and economics that are actually competitive with conventional manufacturing. The AM market has compounded at 20 annually over the last decade to 12 billion by 2019. In the last 3 years before 2019 it actually compounded at 25 annually. We think the market overall exhibited a strong bounce back from COVID19 in the fourth quarter and that points to a promising year ahead. And the industry is expected to continue to compound at roughly 25 over the next decade to get to 146 billion by 2030. This inflection is really being driven by more and more businesses shifting towards end use parts powered by AM 2.0. And that 146 billion only represents 1 penetration of the overall 12 trillion in the global manufacturing industry. So there is plenty of room to continue to grow.,DM,0.0104876458644866,-0.9790258878623773,Negative
Turning to Slide 9 the reason so many businesses are looking to use additive for enduse parts is that it eliminates the need for tooling which has created significant pain points in conventional manufacturing. For example long lead times minimum volume requirements time sensitive machine programming and significant material waste. Conventional manufacturing also creates design limitations that can negatively impact performance and cost in favor of manufacturability. Additive enables benefits like the ability to design complex parts using generative design tools that optimized for real world physics or assembly consolidation which takes many components and prints them as a single part with dramatic efficiencies on weight or performance or mass customization of parts to particular markets or environments. Finally reengineering supply chains are on demand flexible manufacturing capacity and digital inventories where businesses ship files across borders for local manufacturing. There is a dramatic opportunity to reshape global commerce and improve CO2 footprints as we develop more efficient ways to mass produce and ship products to consumers. And these are key longterm tailwinds for AM 2.0.,DM,0.9925925731658936,0.9851851375014409,Positive
I would like to spend some time to highlight some exciting initial applications that are becoming cost effective with our AM 2.0 solutions. In the past you have probably heard of additive being used for very high end very low volume parts like genetic components. I think one of the problems with additive is it costs too much to be used at scale in larger markets. One of the more exciting things about our solutions is that we can now use AM 2.0 technologies to make hundreds of thousands of parts in applications that you never would have considered using additive for in the past.,DM,0.9967039227485656,0.9934078415678984,Positive
On Slide 10 you can see one of our customers for example a company called E.A.C. in France. They are a major supplier of metal accessories for swimwear cosmetics and luxury goods for companies such as Chanel and Louis Vitton. More and more they are using our shop system to mass produce pieces they can end up in stores that you as a consumer could go to and purchase. That is a fantastic fantastic development for additive. They have received their system middle of last quarter and its already making parts in high volume. The shop system helped E.A.C increase their hardware production from 10000 pieces per week to more than 70000 parts per week. Those are real manufacturing numbers. Tens of thousands of pieces per week shop system also allows them to create volume quantities of these accessories which significantly reduced lead times which is important in the fashion industry and minimal to no manual assembly required. This is a game changer for an SME business like this thats supplying enduse parts to a market. And it illustrates several core benefits of the shop system biogenic solution turnkey flexible manufacturing volume production of real enduse parts with faster time to market and the ability to get up and running quickly with minimal prior binder jetting experience. As a plug and play solution its extremely easy to install and deploy.,DM,0.999999701976776,0.9999994039531968,Positive
On Slide 11 another exciting case study is with one of our P1 customers FreeFORM Technologies. They have got a very experienced team in Pennsylvania and are dedicating themselves to making parts with metal binder jetting. To the P1 the part quality and throughput has enabled them to continually gain business with their customers fulfilling small quantities of parts at first and then go into a large volume and because its a digital manufacturing process that can economically turnaround thousands of parts in 1 to 2 weeks versus 2 to 3 months with conventional manufacturing or older generation AM systems at 75 to 90 reduction in lead time. On top of supporting direct material and process transfers to flagship production P50 the P1 is a great tool for highspeed serial production of small and complex parts.,DM,0.9994520545005798,0.9989041083479573,Positive
Turning to Slide 12 since the fourth quarter we also entered a fast growing photopolymer additive market with our acquisition of EnvisionTEC the original inventor of digital light processing or DLP printing an area wide photopolymer 3D printing process. They have significant blocking IP in this segment which has bolstered our DM patent portfolio. Together we created a onestop shop for AM 2.0 solutions across polymers and metals. What we are excited about with EnvisionTEC is that their solutions have been used to produce end use parts at scale with over 10 million parts in 2020 alone. They are market leader in fast growing segments like dental with sales of their Envision One platform grew over 3x in 2020 despite the challenges from COVID19. EnvisionTEC gives us a fantastic platform as we expand the business to reach a whole new set of verticals and applications that benefit from polymer parts and volume. And on top of this we grow our channel in both number and geographic reach with great opportunity for crossselling metal and polymer solutions.,DM,0.9999999403953552,0.9999998807906394,Positive
Looking at the product portfolio as a whole on Slide 13 we feel its the most compelling and diverse set of AM 2.0 solutions in the market and it can cater to metals composites ceramics photopolymers and even include digital casting and bioprinting capabilities. And whats great is that it can address use cases across a product lifecycle from preproduction all the way to volume end use parts. This is a killer product lineup. Almost all of these products have been refreshed and released during the last year and we believe they can take us to significant scale. They are backed by a very strong IP portfolio of over 260 issued and pending patents and supported by a library of over 190 materials. To build these products we really had to pioneer a set of disruptive technologies.,DM,0.9984132051467896,0.9968264084019711,Positive
On Slide 14 now Single Pass Jetting is the patent pending technology that powers our production system platform. Unlike competitive binder jetting systems which typically require 20 to 30 seconds to print a layer the production system P1 and P50 can print a letter in under 3 seconds. This equates to build speeds that are up to 100 times faster than part of a fusion and significantly faster than conventional binder jetting. The P50 can support production of up to millions of parts annually at costs that are competitive with conventional manufacturing at reasonable volumes and this is really key because business wont adopt additive if it can compete on cost. The production system platform offers the only inner processing environment in the market. So we are actually able to print reactive materials we have binder jet. As an example with great announcement last week on a breakthrough in the development of aluminum for binder jetting where we have collaborated with our partners to achieve extremely promising results of over 99 dense 6061 aluminum material with properties better than lot with comparable heat treatment.,DM,0.9996185302734376,0.9992370600921276,Positive
On the metal side we have also got advanced print technology was developed inhouse to be affordable and easy to install. It makes binder jetting an accessible turnkey solution that can be adopted rapidly by businesses and individuals without experience with printing or metallurgy. Both of these technologies are enabled by life center our proprietary sintering simulation software designed to improve our accuracy and eliminate the trial and error for powder metallurgy based additive manufacturing. It dynamically stimulates the sintering step of a binder jetting process to predict shrinkage and distortion incorrect geometries before printing to minimize any deviations from the intended design of the final part. This software tool will be a key enabler for broad adoption of binder jetting.,DM,0.977305233478546,0.9546104399028059,Positive
Turning to Slide 15 on the photopolymer side we have a unique patented technology in continuous digital ad manufacturing. This is an extremely cost effective solution for mass production of photopolymer parts that uses proprietary domeless basement technology to provide higher accuracy prints than membrane alternatives. The Envision One HT which began shipping in the first quarter of 2021 is the only commercially available high temperature high viscosity photopolymer system shipping in volume today. And we think this is the future in photopolymer AM. This technology allows businesses to achieve properties on par or exceeding conventional thermoplastics. And these systems are doing extremely well. On the right here is the new Xtreme 8K solution which uses patented protection array technology to achieve native 8K resolution and effective 16L resolution at very high speeds. Its the most advanced polymer AM system in the market compared to an industrial Fortus 450 FDM printer from Stratasys. This system is up to 100x faster with a build envelope thats roughly the same size. And it offers superior price performance to comparable industrial polymer AM systems. And just like the Envision One HT it supports high temperature high viscosity resins to enable a wide variety of industrial commercial applications.,DM,0.999999701976776,0.9999994039531968,Positive
Digging into our gotomarket on Slide 16 we have got a leading global distribution network today with over 200 partners that can sell and service our solutions in over 68 countries around the world. Our partners address a wide variety of markets and include vertically focused players as well as the ones focused on general industrial businesses. They can support a variety of business models and product offerings whether its low touch high volume or high touch high value. We think this is one of the differentiating assets of DM as a company. And we believe this will be a key factor in accelerating our growth to achieve global scale and launch new products efficiently.,DM,0.9999971389770508,0.999994277950691,Positive
Turning to Slide 17 we have got a very broad adoption of our AM 2.0 technologies across a variety of industries in both polymers and metals healthcare automotive aerospace oil and gas and consumer products diversified manufacturers and machine shops. We are excited to expand this user base to more blue chip customers and SMEs as we continue to ramp production in distribution over our newer solutions.,DM,0.9871542453765868,0.9743084754398317,Positive
Turning to Slide 18 the unit economics of these products are fantastic. The two examples here are the production system P50 and the Xtreme 8K. The lifetime revenue and gross profit of each system is a multiple of the initial sale roughly 3x to 6.5 million in the case of a P50 and upwards of 10x to 1.5 billion with the Xtreme 8K. The current contribution comes from the sale of high margin consumables and services which result in strong gross margin profiles over the life of the system but they really demonstrate a pretty attractive razor razor blade model where the initial sale generates a profit as well.,DM,0.9989572167396544,0.9979144322362137,Positive
Turning for a moment to our strategy related to inorganic growth on Slide 19 there is an opportunity here as we continue to build out a strong distribution channel to bring new technologies on the printer side that are focused on AM 2.0. There is a lot of innovation in the private sector and we look forward to adding new print capabilities to our company to enable a wider set of applications and use cases. The second vector for inorganic growth is materials where we see a huge opportunity to benefit from vertical integration. We have already built vertically integrated structure for materials in the photopolymer side where we also have an open certified materials business model to work with partners with unique materials outside our moat to offer validated thirdparty solutions to customers.,DM,0.9999853372573853,0.9999706744972912,Positive
On the metal side vertically integrating into advanced materials difficult for conventional manufacturing could uplift the lifetime value of a P50 customer by up 2x to 6x. The third vector for inorganic growth is building a strong parts offering around killer app where our focus is to incorporate businesses and segments with high margin high barriers to entry. And you will see more about our strategy in this area as the year progresses and we have secured some of these transactions. We believe this can be very accretive to the company and provide a strong return on capital as in the case with EnvisionTEC. Now there are already several markets which have been quick to adopt AM at scale and we are going to focus on building gotomarket strategies about each of these segments. Hearing aids for example is an application that has almost fully crossed over into additive. The same goes for jewelry where AM is used widely for creating wax molds for casting and now starting to be used for direct metal printing.,DM,0.9999810457229614,0.9999620914233276,Positive
Turning to Slide 20 today we are now seeing the creation of a new business called Desktop Health focused on patientspecific additive manufacturing solutions for the healthcare and dental markets. To help lead this initiative we are bringing on board Mike Jafar who had a historic career at Evolus in Allergan launching some of the best known brands in the healthcare space. We feel there are commercial ready applications in dental orthopedics audiology and surgical instruments but there is also a lot of exciting potential in our untapped categories. And we look forward to working with Mike and his team to evolve solutions for these applications and bring them to the market using our DLP high speed metal binder jetting in Bioplotter solutions. Our vision here is that today you have got more than 85 billion of medical implants annually and they are mostly produce in standard manufactured sizes. We think thats going to change over the next decade or two where most of these parts will become patient specific and thats a major opportunity for additive manufacturing across metals polymers ceramics and all materials.,DM,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
On Slide 21 dental is one of the killer apps for additive manufacturing. Its a segment that has been patient specific for some time now since every part is custom. Its a market thats both growing and adopting additive quite rapidly. However with more than 30 billion in annual parts and spend in dental only a small percentage of that total is printed. Most central parts today are still milled are made by hand in the lab. We see an excellent opportunity for additive to reach up to 75 by 2025 and we plan to be a major enabler of AM adoption in the ortho lab in terms of dental markets. Materials are key to enabling applications in this market. You can see how many different use cases for AM there are in polymers metals and ceramics. We have got several materials that have either received FDA 510k clearance or are in process including proprietary materials for permanent crowns and full arch implant dentures with industry leading performance.,DM,0.9997419118881226,0.9994838234685799,Positive
Turning on to Slide 22 we believe the future is to have processes that take less time where you can remove the temporary steps. An example is full arch implant dentures which is a procedure that today takes an average 3 weeks from beginning to end. Enabled by our breakthrough proprietary materials and combined with our high speed printers we developed with our partners a revolutionary same day digital workflow for full arch implant dentures. This new 3D printed smile takes place in a single day under the comfort of IV sedation. And this will be one of several initial solutions that we will bring to market with Desktop Health.,DM,0.9999566078186036,0.9999132155854797,Positive
Our materials and process have been tested in a clinical study conducted in coordination with leading partners in the field in participation from roughly 900 patients this March 2000. Since then there have been no failures with our printed implant dentures and the results overall have been excellent. This application is part of roughly 4 billion dental implant market where we feel there is potential to completely revolutionize how patients are treated and this is all enabled by a combination of advanced materials in both metals and polymers with really highquality properties and AM technologies suitable for end use part production. We look forward to building a bestinclass team in healthcare and dental to work with our partners in industry to bring patient specific solutions to the market at scale not just in dental but also across cardiology orthopedics ophthalmology dermatology and plastic surgery.,DM,0.9991405010223388,0.9982810010200742,Positive
Now turning to our fourth quarter business highlights on Slide 24. As I mentioned earlier we made several key strides in the fourth quarter towards commercializing our AM 2.0 technology platform. We started global shipments of our Shop System a mass market binder jetting solution for SMEs and machine shops. Its a full turnkey offering designed for flexible mid volume production. Based on published figures in just one quarter in the market Shop System became the number one selling binder system in terms of units. In addition we begin global shipments of our production system P1 solution the entry level model for our production system platform. Its also a great proof point on our path to commercializing the production system P50 in the second half of 2021 as to show the same technology architecture and corporate modules. We are incredibly proud of our dedicated team of employees that helped us achieve these key product launches in spite of the challenges and disruptions created by COVID19 during 2020.,DM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Among our commercialization products we gain adoption from key customers such as Milwaukee Tool Ford Eaton Pratt and Whitney and more. We also launched our sintering simulation software live center for using our binder jetting solutions and received significant awards from the Department of Defense. We beefed up our Board of Directors with the addition of Scott Dussault as Veteran CFO and Steve Nigro who used to be President of HPs printing and imaging business.,DM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
With that turn it over to James who is going to discuss financial highlights. James,DM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks Ric and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. I am James Haley the CFO of Desktop Metal. I am pleased for this opportunity to share Desktop Metals financial results for the first time as a public company. I will begin with a quick recap for those new to Desktop Metal before providing a summary of the companys fourth quarter and full year results for 2020 and closing with guidance for 2021 which can be found on Slide 25. We announced a definitive business combination agreement with Trine Acquisition Corp on August 26 2020 concurrently with a successful PIPE fundraise that in aggregate provided approximately 530 million of net proceeds to our balance sheet. The business combination was completed on December 9 and we began trading on the NYSE on the 10th under the ticker symbol DM.,DM,0.9999979734420776,0.9999959468817394,Positive
Moving to our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 we are pleased with our fourth quarter results which reflected an inflection point in our business as we successfully commenced shipments of several new products. We generated revenue of 8.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 up from 2.5 million in the third quarter and in line with our expectation of sequential acceleration. Casting sales in the fourth quarter was 10 million resulting in gross margin of negative 20. This represents a sharp improvement from the third quarter of 2020 as we began to scale revenue out of our fixed overhead costs as well as a shift towards higher margin products.,DM,0.9981637001037598,0.9963273980184781,Positive
Net loss for the fourth quarter was 25.4 million which includes increased GA expenses related to our transaction with Trine and becoming a public company including additional headcount for corporate functions audit legal professional services and insurance. Looking at the year overall revenue for fiscal 2020 was 16.5 million. Net loss and nonGAAP adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year were negative 90.4 million and negative 73.5 million respectively. We ended the year with a wellcapitalized balance sheet including cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 595.4 million as of December 31 2020.,DM,0.0112073123455047,-0.9775865540424312,Negative
On February 26 2021 with more than 75 of the public warrants from the transaction with Trine already exercised we announced redemption of the remaining outstanding public warrants. Through March 10 2021 11.9 million public warrants were exercised for cash resulting in proceeds of 136.8 million. Looking ahead to 2021 with our robust capital position we plan to hit the accelerator on growth and we will continue to make substantial investments in both organic and inorganic opportunities. Over the past few months we have significantly expanded our sales and marketing engineering and administrative teams to ensure we are well positioned to fast track organic growth. Further we are building out internal MA capabilities to support the multiple inorganic growth initiatives which Ric spoke to earlier.,DM,0.8708972930908203,0.7417944322791292,Positive
For the full year 2021 we expect to generate revenue in excess of 100 million including contribution from EnvisionTEC. We plan to exit the year with an annualized revenue runrate of at least 160 million with multiple product launches from the fourth quarter right in the rearview mirror and additional commercial launches this year with EnvisionTEC Xtreme 8K and Envision One HT in the first half and the production system P50 in the second half we anticipate sequential growth to be relatively modest in the first quarter followed by a more substantial acceleration beginning in the second quarter as various growth initiatives take effect following COVID and as these new solutions pickup steam. Turning to adjusted EBITDA on a nonGAAP basis we expect this to be in the range of negative 15 million to 16 million as we continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth.,DM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
With that I will turn the call over to Ric. Ric,DM,0.8319525718688965,0.6639049434095283,Positive
Thank you James. We are excited to be engaging with our new public shareholders as we embark on this journey. We are building our business for the longterm and our leadership team and board are aligned with our public shareholders. We view our AM 2.0 platform as leading the way in empowering businesses to finally realize the promise of additive manufacturing.

Thank you. Operator Instructions Our first question is coming from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead.,DM,0.9913095235824584,0.9826190368050554,Positive
Good morning. I was wondering Ric looking back at the last  I guess we are at 7 or 8 months now since you announced the transaction and guidance at that point which I think was 15 million to 25 million in revenue for 2020. Can you talk a bit about what headwinds you faced What you are seeing from the market in terms of reception to some of the launches And just whats leading you to be a bit more cautious in first quarter with an expected ramp thereafter Thank you.,DM,0.9977430105209352,0.9954860183513277,Positive
Hey Shannon. Thank you for the question. I think we have great funnel thats building for our products. We didnt get to ship our Shop System until probably middle or second half of the fourth quarter and the traditional COVID supply chain related thing so moving things around the world but we did a global launch in all continents which I think was a strategic thing for us to get going on our Shop System and we did that to prevent potential limitations of different places that we didnt know whether they would be locked down or not. Overall we are pretty happy with the results given all the traditional challenges that our companies faced to get products delivered around the world. And I think that as we come out of pandemic we are going to see some great resurgence and people going back to their labs and manufacturing spaces to execute programs so.,DM,0.9998610019683838,0.999722003771069,Positive
I appreciate that. But I am just trying to figure out and maybe if we think about first quarter and the ramp through the year what sort of builds upon itself that shows the acceleration starting second quarter And what are the sort of the key products we need to watch,DM,0.9822964668273926,0.9645929125505164,Positive
Yes I think its a reflection of our funnel on how its building. Right now weve got a number of exciting products particularly the Envision One HT and Envision One system continues to pick up. We are pretty happy with the way studios continue to develop its now starting to ship and Shop System continued acceleration on that and P1s as well. So its the product that we have been describing. I think as we go through the rest of the year we will have a progression thats similar to what you see in our industry which is Q2 and Q4 probably the landmark quarters in additive and then Q1 is usually a refresh from the beginning of the year. So thats just a reflection of how we feel that year is going to progress based on our funnel and how things are coming along.,DM,1.0,1.0,Positive
I guess one point that I would add on that too is we are planning to launch Envision One HT the Xtreme 8K. We are seeing strong demand for those already. And certainly we have the P50 system that will be coming out in the second half. So the pipeline is really developing from here. I mean Ric touched on the headwinds for Q1 but what we see now we are very optimistic about the remainder of the year.,DM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay thats helpful. And then maybe if you can just talk a bit about from an expense perspective where you are funneling some of the incremental dollars how much of this is because of EnvisionTEC How much you talked about expanding your sales and marketing team and then maybe how much of this is related to your new healthcare initiatives Thank you.,DM,0.9999973177909852,0.999994635578773,Positive
Sure. Great question. I mean certainly as I stated in our prepared marks we are sitting on nearly 600 million of dry powder. Really we are trying to hit the accelerator on growth here and thats going to be achieved certainly with multiple organic and inorganic opportunities. We touched on with building out an internal MA capability certainly our organic sales team the EnvisionTEC sales team marketing continued efforts on research and development looking at various costdown initiatives as well as future products and then all the integration of multiple opportunities we are looking at. I will add too certainly the public company expenses we are not something that was sort of contemplated in some of the numbers prior. Those numbers are certainly substantial. And when you look at our market cap in particular I mean insurance and various professional fees registration fees they are certainly substantial.,DM,1.0,1.0,Positive
Great. Thank you.,DM,0.9971423149108888,0.9942846264151495,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Greg Palm of CraigHallum. Please go ahead.,DM,0.978800356388092,0.9576006875042244,Positive
Yes thanks. Good morning and congrats on all the achievements thus far. I guess maybe just kind of starting at a high level and I am really looking at the product portfolio specific to Desktop but help us understand raking in order of importance studio versus shop versus production. And I am just kind of curious if you think about timing for P50 in the launch is that something that we should expect some revenue contribution this year or is that more of a fiscal 22 event,DM,0.9997589588165284,0.9995179173457132,Positive
No it definitely will expect some contribution from P50 this year in the second half and that continues to be on schedule. P1 and the Shop System are important parts of our product portfolio as they are mass production systems as well as our Shop System. Studio is a product that has to be finished. And we are very excited about our Studio 2. On the photopolymer side the Envision One is very much a hit product. It is doing extremely well in the market and in the particularly in dental labs of all the segments we continue to see significant traction and adoption on it as well as for D4K for chairside and its  we think the products are fantastic. So we are planning to scale Xtreme 8K as the year goes on and are excited about that ramp.,DM,0.9999896287918092,0.9999792575712549,Positive
Got it. And just going back to the commentary on the Q1 assumptions I guess I am just a little bit confused still. So it sounds like in Q4 there were still some kind of COVID related headwinds and maybe some pushouts in terms of timing I guess looking at the revenue guide I thought maybe given some of those new product introductions then obviously you have got contribution from EnvisionTEC that revenue would have jumped or at least the guy that would have suggested a revenue jump more sequentially. I guess you havent quantified what modest really means but just matter of timing and seasonality,DM,0.9961068034172058,0.992213602193357,Positive
Yes you nailed it on the head. Certainly Q1 is traditionally a challenging quarter for the entire industry. Certainly we experienced those challenges as well. We do have some of the COVID challenges going on as well but really as we are heading into Q2 we are feeling very good about Q2.,DM,0.9992486238479614,0.9984972468002122,Positive
Okay understood. And then last one there were some MA rumors floating around this last week I dont expect you to address those reports specifically. But given that you have just completed the acquisition of EnvisionTEC in terms of inorganic how active are you expected to be in the marketplace in terms of additional MA,DM,0.9902933835983276,0.9805867556254599,Positive
I mean we have got a strategy we laid out earlier during our original roadshow and just reiterate it we plan to continue to be active in MA. However it is something that we do selectively. We acquire things that give us new capabilities in either print modalities for AM 2.0 or vertically integrated into materials or consumables that our systems use particular in high volume production applications. And then on the product side we have got a strategy to enabling printing of difficult to manufacture materials which require specialized processing as well as killer apps where their significant IP or high margin markets. And so we are going to continue to execute that and you would see transactions in the future as that goes on. I would say we looked at a lot of business opportunities. Its not uncommon for companies that just went through  what we went through to see a lot of things and so we are very selective in what we actually move forward with but we are excited about the things that we have got in front of us and think we can do very accretive transactions.,DM,0.999891996383667,0.9997839926385836,Positive
Understand. Alright. Appreciate the color. Thanks.,DM,0.9994657635688782,0.9989315265008964,Positive
Thank you.,DM,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Operator Instructions Our next question is coming from Josh Sullivan of Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.,DM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey good morning Ric James Arjun. Congrats on the first public quarter here.,DM,0.9999127388000488,0.9998254774960742,Positive
Thank you.,DM,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
First on the launch of Desktop Health here how should we think of this vertical in the portfolio We are going to have a dedicated sales force whats the gotomarket strategy here and then maybe what are the two or three primary products we should be focusing on over the next year or so,DM,0.9532306790351868,0.906461302316965,Positive
Absolutely. So the health opportunity is massive. Today most parts that are used in healthcare are not patient specific with the exception of dentistry where the clips are made by hand for patients. So when you buy a graft or an implant its traditionally something that was producing 4 5 or 10 sizes and then the surgeons try to match it at the time of surgery. And I think that a decade or two from now everything will be patient specific and based on everything probably with the exception of trauma which needs realtime inventory. But I think that that presents a very unique opportunity to develop a core competency in the business and we are building a world class gotomarket team thats going to develop clear products as well as help our partners in the healthcare industry adopt this technology at scale. We are going to be very creative in the types of products that we are going to help our partners bring to market. And I am excited to share those as we evolve it but I think its going to be a very vibrant part of our business I expect it to be at least a third of our business in the long run. So its a great area where end use products can do very well. And I think you will see the healthcare industry adopt additive at scale over the next decade.,DM,1.0,1.0,Positive
Thanks. And then maybe just one on the production system with the launch of the P1 can you just talk about how thats led to additional pipeline development for the P50 Just curious how those two systems are working together And then may be just what does like the  what does the pipeline of the P50 look like at this point,DM,0.9996672868728638,0.9993345733491024,Positive
Yes it continues to grow. I think we have a great synergy between our P1 and P50. Most customers that buy a P1 no longer want to have a P50. So its an onramp to that platform. It was actually developed in concert with a major customer who bought a P50 but need a P1 type machine in order to qualify materials and parts without having to get a P50 like machine sort of pulled from production in order to do a qualification of our components. So if you are going to mass produce if you are a large company you have got 10000 SKUs 5000 SKUs that you would want to print you need a platform to qualify those while you have got the large CapEx printing 247. And thats how we see the synergy between those two architectures settings or qualification that you are doing on P1 translate to 100 to a P50. They have the same modules and the same inkjet systems the same recording process. So its a onetoone and we validated that with some of our customers that have both installed beta of P50 and have received the P1. And I think that P1 is a much small machine. So its easier to install and deploy but its a great platform its going to help us mature that technology to the point where its you have got high OEE by the time we deploy your P50 into the market later this year. So we are excited about how those two systems play together.,DM,1.0,1.0,Positive
And then just with regard to the EnvisionTEC acquisition subsequent acquisitions you guys might do here how do we think about the longterm targets I understand you dont want to update us every quarter but you have got a lot of dry powder here to execute additional MA. How should we think of those longterm targets maybe versus some of the inorganic opportunities you are pursuing,DM,0.9851301908493042,0.9702603639724039,Positive
I think there are  I mean obviously you would have to update the models when we do the transactions. Some of the companies we are going to acquire are more technically oriented and sort of capabilities on our technology that would allow us to have future products. And some of them are companies that have some scale like EnvisionTEC and an installed base that we are then going to provide additional distribution or help us scale faster. So I think that depends on the transaction. And we have several things that we are working on. So as we execute them we would love to explain the opportunity and why we did what we did and then I think there is a great opportunity in bringing AM 2.0 technologies into the market. One thing that I think is a focus of us is we are not going to do any acquisitions on sort of tooling or take some pictures or things that we would consider AM 1.0. I mean our market grew in sort of a rapid prototyping tooling type of world and our company is 100 focused on mass production of end use parts. So there is a lot of folks that would like to claim that there is the same thing but there is sort of two ways of playing this market. One is to take a technology thats helped patents for example like FDM and develop a more modern version of that for smaller markets like tooling and jigs and fixtures. Another one is to really tackle the issue of how do you go to mass production at scale with additive and we are 100 focused on what we call AM 2.0 which is the production of additive parts at scale at a lower cost structure than conventional manufacturing where the economics are the driver. So thats 100 the focus on the company and all of our MA strategies and execution focus is geared towards making additive cost effective. The systems cost too much today to bring to market and older technologies is not cost effective on a cost per part basis. So the focus on the company is 100 on the combination of techniques that give you a combination of surface finish accuracy material properties and throughput so you can actually go to market with 3D printing.,DM,1.0,1.0,Positive
The one point I would add is the first part of your question and that is the longterm thesis is intact and we are doing everything we can to accelerate it responsibly. So to highlight Rics point I mean we are in the business of acquiring longterm technology thats really going to help us in our shortterm revenue and accretion. So hopefully later this year we will be in a position to provide some updates on the longer term model but as we sit here exiting Q1 we dont think its the right time to do it.,DM,0.9991005063056946,0.9982010115391085,Positive
Got it. Appreciate the time. Thank you.,DM,0.9984176158905028,0.9968352298946557,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Noelle Dilts of Stifel. Please go ahead.,DM,0.978800356388092,0.9576006875042244,Positive
Hey Ric and thanks for taking my question. So this kind of ties into the last question but I am just trying to reconcile the 2021 either the guidance we are talking about the time of the fact. And so I was just trying to understand sort of if you look at that bridge how much of that is coming from EnvisionTEC versus some kind of continued headwinds associated with COVID as we look from I think going from around roughly 31 million loss including some of those public company costs versus the guidance you provided. So could you help me just understand how to think about that,DM,0.9384872913360596,0.8769745093432124,Positive
Sure. So certainly the public company cost as I mentioned are substantially higher than I think what we first thought. Beyond that I really view it as additional investment in the business I mean really as I stated with near 600 million of dry powder we could essentially just go status quo when  and leave their funds in the bank near zero interest. But instead we are doing everything we can to accelerate some of those longer term financial targets. So that is how I would be thinking about it. In terms of EnvisionTEC no that is not really a drain on EBITDA if you will its a transaction that as I mentioned our primary focus is to acquire good technology with EnvisionTEC we certainly got that. We did also get some good stable revenues and a healthy bottom line as well. So really its more about accelerating the growth story.,DM,0.999971091747284,0.9999421834601068,Positive
Okay just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then obviously at the time of the EnvisionTEC acquisition you talked a lot about the growth profile and how you are thinking about contributions but maybe you could speak to if you have kind of worked more with the company and started an efficient if there is any change in how you are thinking about growth over say the next 5 years And then kind of related to the last question I understand you kind of said you are maybe not in the point where you could talk about the longer term business models but maybe going back to the EBITDA question if you would be comfortable kind of talking about generally when you are thinking about maybe hitting a breakeven point or maybe profitability Thanks.,DM,0.9979934692382812,0.9959869360845901,Positive
Sure. So as we think about contributions on the year and really we continue to integrate the businesses every day we are really trying to leverage different sales channels and development strategies as we can. As I think about revenue for the full year I would say roughly 60 as we sit today is going to be on the organic DM side with 40 would be in EnvisionTEC. That said going forward its not something that we really plan to talk about as these products are going to be fully and teams are going to be integrated to really maximize our sales if you will. In terms of the longer term targets we are not in a position to update those today other than to say they are  we are doing what we can to really pull the timelines in.,DM,0.9332916140556335,0.8665831485886268,Positive
Okay thank you very much.,DM,0.9785473942756652,0.9570947629778161,Positive
Yes.,DM,0.7864110469818115,0.5728218393455979,Positive
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Ricchiuti of Needham  Company. Please go ahead.,DM,0.9819725155830384,0.9639450096756279,Positive
Alright thank you. Good morning. Just question on your OpEx investments for 2021 I am wondering does that contemplate expansion of your direct sales efforts Just wondering also in terms of your partner network the presentation references 200 partners and I am wondering if you could provide any color on what percent of that represents EnvisionTEC and whether among those 200 partners if there is much overlap partners representing both DM and EnvisionTEC Thanks.,DM,0.9999902844429016,0.9999805688742214,Positive
Yes. So we went from about 90 partners to over 200 when we did our transaction and acquired EnvisionTEC. I would say we have a significant continued expansion in our gotomarket strategy and there is significant synergies between the channel that they have built in our channel at very successful vertical integration into the  or vertical channels into dental and jewelry. We are planning to leverage those as well as Health and EnvisionTEC getting to the industrial markets which is an area where they hadnt participated as much before. So hopefully that answers your question.,DM,0.9997661113739014,0.9995322224689855,Positive
It helps. And then just again looking at the investments your plan for 21 on OpEx and I may have missed it but I am wondering if there is any flavor you could provide in terms of RD versus sales and marketing and enhancing the gotomarket,DM,0.8327641487121582,0.6655280980635274,Positive
Well Id say that we have increased investment in a variety of areas besides RD. We also have investments in applications engineering gotomarket related activities and new product development.,DM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks a lot.,DM,0.9369170665740968,0.873834057947432,Positive
Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.,DM,0.9609941840171814,0.9219883215357789,Positive
I am very excited to be talking to you all and look forward to connecting with you post this call if anybody has additional questions. Thank you very much for your support today. And we are excited to be bringing additive manufacturing solutions at scale to mass produce parts and volume and accentuate people make products around the world.,DM,0.9999959468841552,0.9999918937634786,Positive
Thank you. Have a great day.,DM,0.9970501065254213,0.9941002095342935,Positive
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation and interest in Desktop Metal. You may disconnect your lines and log off the webcast at this time and have a wonderful day.,DM,0.998970091342926,0.9979401814581046,Positive
Great. Moving right along here with DuPont. Were very happy to have  Jeff and I are very happy to have CEO Ed Breen and CFO Lori Koch. Operator Instructions.,DD,0.999897837638855,0.9997956751559229,Positive
But before we go to the fireside chat and QA I think Ed and Lori are going to walk through a bit of a presentation. So with that guys thanks for joining us. And take it away.,DD,0.9198063611984252,0.8396126267985262,Positive
Great. Thanks Steve and Jeff. Appreciate being here. We put out on our Investor Relations website a few charts. And we also put an 8K out with the charts on it if anyone wants to take a look at those. But let me just summarize a couple of the few of the key points that are on there. Number one were reconfirming guidance for the first quarter and for the full year on net sales operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. So feeling very good about that.,DD,0.999982476234436,0.9999649524479821,Positive
Secondly I would like to just highlight for a moment the Laird acquisition that we announced a week ago for 2.3 billion. Number one strategically we feel very good about the fit of this business with our EI segment. This business really brings 2 key technologies for us. They have a lot of solutions around managing heat and product  protect devices from electromagnetic interference. And these are 2 very key items that need to be addressed over time with the miniaturization and more computing power thats occurring in the industry that we think is a great secular a growth area for us for many many years to come.,DD,0.9807032942771912,0.9614065655509028,Positive
And it really touches on a lot of capabilities across the board here whether its 5G smart autonomous vehicles the Internet of Things AI and highperformance computing think of things like gaming consoles and things like that. So really a nice fit. And really it will give us a solution sale to our OEM and customers in the marketplace really a complete package. So were really excited about that.,DD,0.9961875081062316,0.992375011667616,Positive
Were highly confident in the synergies we can get from this field. Weve announced cost synergies of 60 million. Its going to cost us 40 million to actually get those synergies but we will have  achieve a high singledigit ROIC on this by year 5. So very confident in the financials of it. And we basically paid 11x for the business with the cost synergies accounted in there. So again we feel very good financially and I think a good investment for us and therefore for our shareholders.,DD,0.8213820457458496,0.6427638785623779,Positive
And then let me just close with our capital allocation. As you all know we had about 5 billion of excess cash going into this year and through this year. A lot of that came from the proceeds we got from the NB and IFF transaction. And so we will delever the balance sheet here. We got one more payment to make in May with an outstanding bond. And we will have our ratings  or metrics right where we wanted 2.75 which is a very strong BBB rating. So balance sheet will be in great shape.,DD,0.8216745257377625,0.6433488388948672,Positive
We announced last week in addition to our already outstanding share repurchase which is 1 billion and then we just announced 1.5 billion on top of that that will run for about the next year and a few months. So about 2.5 billion of share repurchase firepower here in the near term. And then of course with the 2.3 billion we paid for the Laird acquisition. You can see that about takes care of a lot of the cash very quickly thats excess sitting on our balance sheet.,DD,0.8337269425392151,0.6674536868653815,Positive
We are looking at  as Ive highlighted on the last earnings call were looking at one other tuckin acquisition. Dont know if it will happen or not. But its in the 200 million to 300 million range. So that could potentially happen. If that is going to happen it would be over the next quarter that we would know that and announce that.,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Again as we also announced on the last quarterly earnings. Were maintaining our current dividend of 1.20 per share and we plan on talking to the Board in raising that consistently year in and year out. And we also on our kind of allocation of capital are keeping our CapEx at around 5. We would like to work that down in a couple of years in the range of 4 to 5 but we have a couple of years here of a couple of big expansion products capped on in our electronics business and our new Line 8 on Tyvek. So that will be in that kind of low5 range for a couple of years and then well work that down more as we move forward. And RD will continue to run at 4. Remember thats very varied by business the highest spend obviously in the EI business the lower spend in the MM business. Just so I think feel very good about how were balancing our capital allocation decisions here as we go through 2021.,DD,0.9989531636238098,0.9979063259996928,Positive
Steve with that I think Ill turn it back over to you and we can open it for QA.,DD,0.9881447553634644,0.9762894965943674,Positive

Q  Charles Tusa,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Great. Thanks Ed. Appreciate that. Can you just maybe  I know you touched on kind of reaffirming the guide maybe what youre seeing in a couple of the key end markets that I know have been highlevel drivers for you guys Autos semis maybe somewhat related these days perhaps autos production. Maybe a little bit weaker on supply constraints around semis. What are you seeing out there on kind of the more shortcycle aspects of your business,DD,0.9998369216918944,0.9996738431893841,Positive
Yes. Ill give a few and maybe Lori wants to jump in also. The semi business obviously is running very hot. As you know its a highmargin business for us also. So thats a nice sign. But clearly theres supply disruptions out there force majeures out there. But having said that our EI business is having a very nice quarter.,DD,0.9967994689941406,0.9935989341729488,Positive
I think you see the numbers out there. Auto production might be down about 1 million units during this period of time here. But its not a business thats going to be lost. Its just some shifting of business because of the supply issues that are out there in the marketplace. And clearly there are shipping logistics issues especially out on the West Coast. So theres a little bit of disruption with that.,DD,0.0069141685962677,-0.9861728466587345,Negative
But having said that business is running very hot and things might just shift out a little bit. I would think by the time we get through the second quarter a lot of these issues will be resolved. So its not a market share issue for anybody. Its just maybe delaying some  but the actual auto business finished goods inventory is low. Polymer inventory is low in the chain. So its not like theres any buildup there. I mean the demand is there. And it cant totally be supplied in the time frame people want it.,DD,0.0026996731758117,-0.9946018425237195,Negative
But I would just give you maybe another area. The residential business is running very hot the doityourself stuff on the resi side really hot. The weaker areas still are commercial construction oil and gas and aerospace. I would kind of put those in that  by the way they are recovering coming up but theyre not back to kind of 2019 levels. And probably those three markets oil and gas commercial construction and aerospace are about 12 of our revenue somewhere in that ZIP Code.,DD,0.0117745995521545,-0.9764519789528722,Negative
And then how do you see kind of the PPErelated business moving along here in the next several quarters,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Our forecast is that the PPE stuff for the frontline responders will start to decline second third and fourth quarter. But remember were sold out on Tyvek. So what we did last year to help with the pandemic is we shifted more of the production to the protective garments. And what we will now do  weve been shorting the housing market. We were shorting the medical packaging market. By the way both are nice margin businesses. And so well  if that occurs where it starts to slow down well start shifting over to those end markets. And the demand is there for us to do that.,DD,0.9182858467102052,0.8365715960094908,Positive
So we expect to run Tyvek full out all year. And its one of the reasons where  our biggest CapEx program actually is Tyvek Line 8 over in Luxembourg and that will be online in a couple of years. Weve been getting better throughput as you noticed last year with Tyvek. So our uptimes or efficiency in our facilities. Weve really been putting a lot of work into that which were doing across the whole manufacturing platform. And we saw some nice volume increases last year on our production lines and were running full capacity but we got more out of it.,DD,0.993315041065216,0.9866300741613352,Positive
So I guess is that on net kind of a flattoup scenario for that full product line or modestly down Or what are we  how do you think about that whole complex there for the year,DD,0.1848831474781036,-0.6302346767393809,Negative
Yes. I think you can call it low single digits. And so it obviously runs sold out. There are some multiyear indiscernible that will create some noise. But remember that we also brought Line 1 back online. So thats coming up as we speak. That will add incremental capacity to allow us to drive low singledigittype volume growth within Tyvek.,DD,0.8737873435020447,0.7475745365467885,Positive
Got it. Got it. Whats going on in China these days They obviously first in first out had some nice growth last year. What are you seeing over in China Ed,DD,0.9841305017471312,0.968260984576335,Positive
China is running very hot and its across all of our divisions. All 3 are nicely doubledigit growth rates. So  and again it doesnt look like theres a significant buildup yet in the channel. But every single business for January and February was running really good.,DD,0.9666104316711426,0.9332208235387942,Positive
And then just on  one last one for you before I pass it over to Jeff on pricing. You guys definitely had some headwinds there last year. What  inflations coming how do we kind of gauge price this year Any changes to your expectations there,DD,0.9271241426467896,0.8542481984187356,Positive
Yes. I would say a couple of areas. The pricing is more important in the MM business. And sequentially its improving from the end of the year through the first quarter as we said by about 2 percentage points. So well be down about 2 still because youre not lapping COVID there.,DD,0.9566291570663452,0.9132582624305858,Positive
And then pricing is very constructive right now in that business. So we feel like any raw material increases which by the way will be somewhat significant this year well be able to cover that with price. And then youll see more of the price as we go into the second quarter. Obviously youll see the ramp occur as we announced some price increases.,DD,0.9671823978424072,0.9343647565631608,Positive
We expect some price  ability to get price in what was SC or WP now business. So that would be maybe 1 this year somewhere in that zip code. And that will ramp up more second third and fourth quarter in that business.,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then the EI business Steve you generally dont get price in that business. Its a volume game. So weve always seen to run about 0 to minus 1 on price but youre introducing a lot of products quicker cycle. And you get the pricing on the new product when you get some of the feed. So thats kind of how we see the year playing.,DD,0.9978513717651368,0.9957027409689077,Positive
So I guess for total company what do you expect for price like 1 point or 2,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Somewhere right in there.,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thats fair.,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. Jeff you got a couple there,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Ed I think you signed up for another three year stint in managing DuPont. What do you want to accomplish over those three years Like when you come to the end what is it that you want to have done,DD,0.0841313600540161,-0.8317383716931175,Negative
Well I dont know that three years will be the end. So let me just start out by saying that my  but I  yes I did sign up for three more years with a new contract. Look a whole bunch of things. I like where we have the portfolio now. Its been a 5year journey. Weve created I think 4 incredible companies with the new Dow with Corteva DuPont and now NB merged in IFF I think weve created a world leader there. So it was a lot of transformation over that 5year window. Now I really want to  I dont know if I use the word settle in because thats not my style but I like where we have DuPont and I really want to run it well consistent results generate good conversion of our cash to be able to reinvest in the business.,DD,0.9939416646957396,0.9878833221693766,Positive
And I think were going to have a nice top line growth company and we have a lot of opportunities on our gross margin line in the company for improvement. And Lori and I are spending a lot of time there with our management team for improvements there.,DD,0.9938581585884094,0.9877163098551689,Positive
So if I look out three years I want to be known as one of the premier multiindustrial companies out there and I want to be valued for that.,DD,0.153836190700531,-0.6923286273054048,Negative
Can you restate your gross margin aspirations What is it that  where are you now now that youve separated off IFF And where do you hope to be,DD,0.2281132936477661,-0.543774332865675,Negative
Yes. So our gross margins if you just look back over the last 3 4 years were kind of in the mid30s 35. We said well make 100 basis point improvement this year on it. Theres a few areas for us but the biggest single area were focused on now is really on the factory floor. We feel like we have a lot of opportunity for improvement in our supply chain our forecasting our uptimes our reliability metrics. And its all being driven by data analytic tools Jeff that are now available out there. And by the way these tools are not like ERP systems. They are 200000 300000 digital tools that are doing a lot of data mining and really making it better than the human brain can forecast things.,DD,0.9893115758895874,0.9786231390375728,Positive
And so weve had some real success with that this past year. So were implementing a digital upgrade programs throughout the company. Weve got a phased by facility where we want to do things. And so thats our single biggest opportunity because Jeff as you know in this business a couple of points of uptime on some of these heavy assets is a big deal. So like think of the Tyvek line the Kevlar line the Nomex lines. Its a big big deal for us. And a great example of that was the improvements we made in Tyvek last year and got the extra volumes out and it just drops to the bottom line. So thats our single biggest area.,DD,0.9999064207077026,0.9998128413038501,Positive
And then weve really oriented our RD towards these higher secular growth areas and I think thats going to pay off very well for us over the next 3 to 5 years. They happen to be the highergrowth areas like the Laird acquisition and where were spending RD for instance in the EI business and those areas I mentioned a few minutes ago. And they happen to be businesses there for that are going to command higher gross margins and therefore higher EBITDA margin.,DD,0.9987927675247192,0.9975855336103043,Positive
So we think weve got a 300 to 500 basis point opportunity in the businesses over multiple years. And so a big focus there. And obviously pricing plays into gross margin expansion. And as we launch these new products in these growth areas well make sure we get the right price for them. So its a multipronged approach but the biggest part of it really is factory efficiency piece that were working on.,DD,0.9985173344612122,0.9970346671549482,Positive
Thats a lot of productivity improvement. Youre a big company. So if you can get 300 to 500 basis points of gross margin its like 500 million 600 million in EBITDA. Are those realistic  are those stretched expectations or...,DD,0.973719358444214,0.9474386855594432,Positive
Maybe theyre worth...,DD,0.9014925956726074,0.802985073915168,Positive
And I guess Ed does that all drop through I mean is that kind of a gross Should we just add that to our numbers or you keep that up.,DD,0.9906216859817504,0.9812433607836726,Positive
No. Its a gross. Its a gross. Well reinvest some of it in the business but well get a decent amount drop to the bottom line. So yes  no thats  weve kind of laid out this multiyear program and Im highly confident well make the progress this year. Youll see it this year some of it.,DD,0.1407736539840698,-0.7184537163100937,Negative
Ed many DuPont shareholders are holders of IFF. And can you talk about the role that youre playing there I know that IFF has invited Scott Ferguson to be on the Board at Sachem Head  from Sachem Head. Do you know him How do you see that company changing,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. So I dont want to go into too many details but Id certainly make a few comments on it. Yes I do know Scott. Hes a great guy and he gets it. And look strategically this is a phenomenal company were putting together. And I havent heard from anybody that does not agree with that comment. The breadth of what well have to offer for end customers here is pretty incredible.,DD,0.9892793893814088,0.9785587659828463,Positive
And Jeff its very interesting all the deals Ive done in my career its the only time I really remember a bunch of customers call and say I cant wait to talk to you about the solutions that you can provide us with what youre putting together. Just  you dont hear that often. In this case it really did happen.,DD,0.9980286359786988,0.9960572696073473,Positive
And look the key right now is to come out of the shoot and operationally run this company very well. Theres cost synergies to get. Theres revenue synergies to get. And we got to come out running and running hard on it.,DD,0.2150845229625702,-0.5698318897675811,Negative
So I will  Im on the Board and Ill become the lead director I guess right around May whenever the shareholder meeting is. And I purposely wanted to be on the Board to make things  sure things go well because it is a lot of our shareholders that are in the IFF stock and we want to make sure it goes well. So we had the right to appoint six Board members. And then the legacy members of the IFF Board that were on it are seven right now. And then a year later it will go to 66. So we wanted representation to make sure we really come out good.,DD,0.9401350021362304,0.8802699329077794,Positive
Ed can you  also I must tell you that when I speak to the customers of IFF and DuPont they really do want the companies to come together and to execute in that DuPont was so active in early RD and product development with consumer products companies and the companies want IFF to take that RD and come up with a product and bring it to market more quickly. So I have the same impression that you did. Ed can you can you...,DD,0.8846493363380432,0.7692985351672978,Positive
Well Jeff I would also comment one of the advantages of that company is the scale of the RD. And were not going to slash and burn RD. Thats not the game here. Weve got real scale. And because of the breadth of the organization its not just the big consumer companies that we can service really well. Theyre very interested in us solving solutions for but the combined package. But remember we have the feet on the street the capability and the application engineering in that business to really handle the mediumsized customer and the small local customers which is becoming a bigger piece of that marketplace. And theres not a lot of companies that have the scale were going to have to address that full customer set.,DD,0.1009371578693389,-0.7981267560283878,Negative
Ed are you making any progress on PFAS litigation And how difficult a problem is that to make any progress on,DD,0.0879505574703216,-0.8240999723076656,Negative
Yes. Look I feel good about where weve gotten to so far. Ive always said its kind of  I look at it as a 3pronged approach. One was to resolve the rest of the MDL in Ohio. We did that across DuPont 27 million. I think the biggest thing though on that same announcement was we finally got a deal done. I think we were working on it for about a year me personally by the way. And we have a deal now worked out between Corteva Chemours and us. Thats really key to now how we resolve the rest of the issues. Because theres a blueprint everybody knows their responsibility.,DD,0.9998384714126588,0.9996769426327603,Positive
And more importantly Jeff the 3 companies are holding hands and working together on these issues where we were  I would just say we were not holding hands before. So that makes a huge difference now because were all aligned.,DD,0.8552218675613403,0.7104435625335948,Positive
And so the third piece of it really in my mind is the confusion that people have around firefighting foam. As you know we never made it. I think its the bigger of the issues just from a perception standpoint. The reality of us getting out of it is very different than some of the perception of what you read in articles and some of the analysts say the exposure could be.,DD,0.0069808661937713,-0.9860394513842174,Negative
So now that we can all work together I think theres a path to resolve the firefighting foam which is the bulk of all the cases left whether its states its individual claims. The good news is thats mostly consolidated into an MDL down in South Carolina. And so you can actually wrap your arms around either letting it play out through the court system which will prove out DuPont has extremely low exposure here when the facts keep coming out or do we take the path of potentially the 3 companies working together to come up with a settlement agreement.,DD,0.999980330467224,0.9999606609110001,Positive
Remember were not the big company here that the bigger pay day is going to come from. Its something we can really show here is our exposure if any. And can we get them a settlement that way like by the way we did up in Ohio.,DD,0.9983642101287842,0.9967284183075538,Positive
And so Im confident we can make a lot of progress in 2021. I dont want to put a date on it but its no longer 3 years out resolve it. Were getting in that window where thats now possible. And so Ill personally be spending time on that. And remember if there is a settlement its split between 3 companies.,DD,0.9939900636672974,0.9879801201701881,Positive
And I think the blueprint  by the way I would look at the agreement if you read it close between the 3 companies where our total exposure in that is 1.35 billion. But I never believe the number would be anywhere near that high. So one of the compromises was well put x amount of cash into like a trust fund and the amount of cash were putting in is way way way less than that number because I dont want dead money sitting around. Thats not going to be used. So thats how we structured it.,DD,0.0595336854457855,-0.8809337502323092,Negative
And by the way we also want to make sure the other 2 companies are standing up to their obligation. If theres cash sitting aside solely for this purpose thats a good thing. But were not going to overfund it.,DD,0.9904136657714844,0.9808273201151609,Positive
Ed when you think about kind of like the potential for like a more kind of like global solution to this problem industrywide I mean are you saying that you think that the federal government is going to get involved here in the next kind of 12 to 18 months and put a stamp on this Or are you just talking about your kind of pocket with the three companies that youre kind of dealing with,DD,0.9939446449279784,0.9878892826374068,Positive
Yes. So look I think the one thing Steve that can happen with the federal government especially now with the Biden administration is and more focused on the EPA and issues they could designate this as a hazardous material. Weve been supportive of that because we would like a national standard set instead of every state doing something different and then youre dealing with that. So we actually think the path they could potentially head down that doesnt bother us at all. But my gut is if we want to resolve 90 of this its our three companies coming up with a settlement in a consolidated MDL.,DD,0.0512837171554565,-0.8974336966477017,Negative
Right. That makes a lot of sense. Right. Jeff did you have anything else,DD,0.9415876865386964,0.8831753034444474,Positive

When I think about the electric vehicle opportunity for DuPont it seems that the opportunity is not only in the electronics business but in transportation and industrial business and in safety and construction. So is the meaning of it that netnet its negative for TI but positive overall for the company And when you think about which segment benefits most from EV which one is it Is it electronics,DD,0.8368468284606934,0.6736934624275341,Positive
Yes. I can walk through the conversion that weve mentioned in the past and its going to change with the acquisition of Laird. And so with the acquisition of Laird we get access to the ADAS side of the autonomous vehicle component of the conversion to hybrid and electricals. So well have to reset our content for vehicle metrics once we have a full understanding of what that looks like.,DD,0.9988082647323608,0.9976165280440616,Positive
But for the heritage DuPont portfolio it is going from about 170 a car today for an ICE engine up to north of 300 for a fully electric vehicle. And so theres puts and takes within the MM portfolio as you mentioned. So there would be less polymer use when you lose the engine component. But theres also additional volume on the adhesive side. And so we have an application that we see growing very nicely alongside the electric vehicle conversion for an adhesive that goes in as a gap filler within the battery.,DD,0.8960179090499878,0.7920356941435898,Positive
But I would say the largest opportunity for us as you mentioned does sit within electronics just as you have the entire vehicle from infotainment to the semiconductor side to electrify everything being the beneficiary.,DD,0.952977418899536,0.9059547817437539,Positive
And real quick on the water and protection side the application there is that you can use Nomex as a battery separator. And so there is as you mentioned the application across all 3 that contribute to the  from the 170 to the 320. I would say the largest component and benefactor is EI thats now even better with the Laird acquisition.,DD,0.9993967413902284,0.998793482061316,Positive
Steve over to you.,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Just to wrap up here had a question on the other side of the pricecost dynamics. We have a little bit of inflation coming through. Maybe talk about any updated thoughts on kind of the raw material side for you guys. I know its kind of less of an issue than for other chemical companies but whats the updated outlook there raw material prices,DD,0.8913129568099976,0.7826257840548658,Positive
Yes. So we had originally mentioned it would be about 100 million of a headwind with the predominance of that being within the MM segment. Its larger than that now. Its kind of hard to size with everything going on but the key takeaway is were confident that whatever the increase in raw is well get it back in price. And so the environment is very conducive to raising price in both water and protection and MM and were taking advantage. So if there is  obviously youll have a headwind to the actual gross margin percentage but not an EBITDA impact.,DD,0.1370623111724853,-0.7258764063575307,Negative
Within the water and protection business what are some of the more exciting kind of meaningful growth businesses there You mentioned the construction business obviously. You guys mentioned water quite a bit but we dont hear about it a lot. And Im not quite sure its that sizable yet but like what are some of the more attractive growth drivers there longer term,DD,0.996073603630066,0.9921472025795,Positive
Yes. So for us today water is about a 1.3 billion business in the portfolio. We significantly added on to it at the end of 2019 with 4 acquisitions. And then as I mentioned were scouting another acquisition right now which would expand our footprint in emerging regions. And so we look for it to grow kind of in the mid to high single digits. But the areas of opportunity with the highest growth are around commercial and residential use wastewater treatment and desalinization.,DD,0.8512558341026306,0.7025114908882921,Positive
So well look to deploy our technology portfolio which is the broadest in the industry. So weve got applications in reverse osmosis exchange and now water filtration with the acquisitions. So we look to deploy that technology play across the landscape. But the largest is in residential and wastewater and desalination. And then regionally the largest opportunity of course is in Asia Pacific as they look to have more access to clean water.,DD,0.8977711200714111,0.7955421182764282,Positive
And how fast is that business growing now Or did that perform reasonably well in the downturn And how do we look at it kind of coming out,DD,0.8432315587997437,0.6864629307168308,Positive
It did. Last year it was up low single digits so we started very strong and then we had some challenges with logistics towards the end of the year. This year were off to a good start and well look to target as I had mentioned mid to high singledigit growth.,DD,0.1449600160121917,-0.7100809872633145,Negative
Got it. Okay. Jeff anything else for you,DD,0.9849574565887452,0.9699148952453707,Positive
Are the comparisons in electronics difficult in 2021 given how much cell phone demand there was in 2020 and if people were at home and the world went more virtual Or is the comparison not a specially difficult given the opportunities you have,DD,0.8196414709091187,0.639282726813988,Positive
So I think they get more challenging potentially in the second half just given the second half of 2020 was stronger than the first half. As Ed had mentioned were off to a very strong start in the guidance that we provided for the full year. We were a little bit more conservative on the back half in electronics just given how hot we ran at the end of this year and the expectation for growth in the first half.,DD,0.0320857763290405,-0.9358296011862762,Negative
But importantly if were wrong on that well participate in the upside. And so we have a great portfolio. We have no share concerns. Well continue to grow in excess of the market. So should the market continue to run very hot then well continue to participate and very high growth there. But last year I think our heritage EI portfolio before we made the transition was up high single digits. And so a very nice grower for us.,DD,0.9998777508735656,0.9997555016013988,Positive
Yes. And Jeff one of the areas remember it was interesting to watch. We have the 5G applications with the Kapton technology and thats just beginning. We just started getting the orders. I think it was the second quarter last year we ramped up shipments on. And then it did not slow down in the fourth quarter which would normally be the decline because the phones were made for the holiday season. So as more phones are just replaced with 5G phones I think theres potentially a little bit of a different cycle going on in that piece of the business.,DD,0.8334817886352539,0.6669633787652127,Positive
Look the interesting thing none of us know is yes everyones been working at home but it sounds like everyones going hybrid in the future. And what does that do to computing and advanced nodes and data centers And its hard to let it play out. But as Lori said if its hotter market than we think well participate. Its not a market share issue. But maybe we planned a little conservative. I dont know.,DD,0.0006637573242187,-0.9986736766539078,Negative
Ive got one from the line here. Is it right that nylon 66 ends up within auto mostly in hot and harsh environments in the engine such that losing this in EV overwhelms the benefits of the electronics You guys addressed that to a degree but maybe a bit more specifics there on that front in particular,DD,0.149886816740036,-0.7002273799344181,Negative
Yes. So a lot of the nylon applications are under the hood but theres applications that potentially offset that headwind as I had mentioned in the adhesive application in the battery but also the adhesives more broadly go into the body of the car. So as you have to bind structures together with more lightweight applications the adhesive play that we have it already has a market today that will continue to grow. So there are puts and takes that put us in a nice position to enable that 170 to overall north of 300 that I had mentioned.,DD,0.0141186416149139,-0.9717638920330358,Negative

Is it one Or is it many or somewhere in between,DD,0.2287966609001159,-0.5424075975463376,Negative

Yes. I mean I think within electronics I can  we sell  we have great relations with the tier players and the OEMs where we can influence both sides of it. So we have relationships down on the OEM where that may not be where we directly sell into. We may sell into the tier providers that they influence what they spec in with the tier providers.,DD,0.963342308998108,0.926684574296817,Positive
And so we usually  we dont have salespeople in general that cross outside the segment. And so we have dedicated people within electronics and several electronics players obviously within water and protection to sell those players in MM. So theres not a lot of crosssegment selling. But we do as appropriate bring a broad portfolio of products to the OEMs to enable specific technologies that they need to continue their technology road maps.,DD,0.9436063170433044,0.8872125668600601,Positive
And so back to the Laird acquisition now within Interconnect Solutions well be able to have even a broader set that we can bring to the consumer electronics space the telecom space on the 5G infrastructure side. So today our 5G exposure was really on the device side. With the Laird acquisition we now get exposure on the infrastructure side. And so thats our intent is to continue to be a provider through application development with a broad technology portfolio.,DD,0.9781516194343568,0.9563032128233988,Positive
Yes Jeff think of it  maybe Ill summarize it also. Think of it as having  and this is a strength to DuPont. I mean we think its a real strength of Laird also. But on the EI front the company is very strong in application engineers that kind of live with the end customer the OEM. By the way the IFF company with NB is the same way. Its a lot of application engineers that will live with a customer to resolve  come up with solutions to their technical issues. And so thats how you can bring the package together to create a kind of more of a packaged solution sale versus each individual piece being worked on.,DD,0.9983379244804382,0.9966758469795269,Positive
Yes. And on the semi side the same thing theres very few semi players right So we bring a broad array of products to be able to enable the production of the chip to the handful of semi producers today.,DD,0.7615527510643005,0.5231052178771602,Positive
And when it comes to  another kind of question around portfolio are there more kind of big ones out there I know you mentioned theres going to be a small bolton. Youve got the 2.5 billion of buyback thats out there. This was a little bit earlier than I would have expected for a big deal like this. Are there a couple more like this out there over the next 18 months,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I dont think Steve over the next 18 months. In the next couple of year window maybe a little longer could there be another one Yes there is some interesting things potentially out there. This one just  weve been eyeballing this one for a long time. We knew it strategically fit very well. By the way there was a couple of other companies that would love to have this asset. And so we moved on it. We knew about it for quite a period of time. Its just such a beautiful fit with us.,DD,0.9997704029083252,0.9995408055429491,Positive
So I dont see anything in the next year to 18 months. In a little bit longer window could there be Yes. And could there be a couple of other boltons besides one were working on Of course there could be. But let me just summarize it by saying were not going deal crazy now. Its not like were going to turn around and start buying companies left the right. Thats not the game plan.,DD,0.0008980333805084,-0.9982051242620494,Negative
Right. And then Lori I know theres some buzz about  today about tax  U.S. corporate tax going back up to 28. How would that kind of influence you guys assuming just that part of the whole equation was kind of rolled back up to 28,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Theres a couple of headwinds in the Biden plan besides just the U.S. corporate rate going up to 28. Theres also the impact on the foreign earnings piece that were working through. And so if the full Biden plan goes into effect then it puts the U.S.based companies at a disadvantage. It puts our tax rate higher than the OECD countries and everything else. So were still working through it but it would be a few hundred basis point increase in our tax rate if the full plan were implemented.,DD,0.0001847743988037,-0.9996316430757303,Negative
And then on a cash basis you said  you mentioned something about  that that would be a cash hit to the foreign earnings,DD,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. So you wouldnt be able to take the credit that you take today through some of the tax structures that we have for foreign earnings. And so our cash taxes are less than our book taxes. We havent really sized in the past how much less they are but they are less. So the bigger component that were paying attention to is how those foreign earnings are taxed.,DD,0.0115998685359954,-0.9768014411934861,Negative
Got it. And then one last one Ed I know there was like a lot of debate around some of the parts and you guys would throw out various multiples for your business over time. I think you believed in a bit of a sum of the parts. Are we now kind of  look were operating steady state now. This is the portfolio that were married to for the next couple of years. Or are there  are you  is there a chance to be more opportunistic with another move,DD,0.9998102188110352,0.9996204373958333,Positive
Yes. Look it just depends on what comes along with you. I think everyone knows my history. If somethings interesting it creates a lot of shareholder value. Of course were going to look at it. Were not tied to anything. But I would just say generally we like where were at. My guts is were going to run it this way in the next couple of years grow the business organically a little bit inorganically and string together a lot of consistent quarters here. But you never know what comes along the  youll look at.,DD,0.999969720840454,0.9999394416448124,Positive
Great. I think thats all the time we have now. I really appreciate you guys spending 40 minutes with us. And best of luck over the course of this year and have a great day. Thanks.,DD,0.9999914169311525,0.9999828338520731,Positive
Great. Thanks. Thanks for having us.,DD,0.9993709325790404,0.9987418644081736,Positive

Lauri will talk through the results in greater detail. Weve made significant progress in 2020. Ill highlight our strengthened financial position the excellent results from our Customer Care business the progress on our cost reduction efforts our new executive hires and our optimism around our business going forward.

Secondly our contact center results for the year. Revenue grew in our Customer Care segment by 44.5 for the quarter fueled by continuing project work increased volume from existing clients and new wins.

In addition leveraging work at home has allowed us to eliminate typical cost constraints tied to pure brickandmortar facilities such as recruiting space hardware and aspects of connectivity. We also added technology capabilities such as Tableau to improve our reporting and expanded our business intelligence capabilities with dashboard development and analytic modeling also borrowing from our Marketing Services business.,HRTH,0.0742519497871398,-0.8514972040040518,Negative
As the consumer interacts more in realtime through social media we formalized our relationship with indiscernible creating an integrated platform that allows customers to interact across multiple messaging platforms. We integrate this solution across the multiple CRMs we support including Oracle CX Salesforce and Zendesk. Huge kudos to Ben Chacko our new Managing Director for Customer Care and for his stellar team for leading an amazing transformation of the business in 2020.,HRTH,0.9971067905426024,0.9942135776362284,Positive
Thirdly our cost reductions. We implemented cost reductions across every aspect of the company reducing overall costs in 2020 by over 20 million. Our cost cutting was a key contributor to our 1.9 million in positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter our third quarter in a row of positive adjusted EBITDA. We reduced our operating expenses in all areas including labor production distribution advertising and selling general and GA expenses.,HRTH,0.0171258151531219,-0.9657495413717875,Negative
Fourth new executive hires. To drive growth and momentum we brought on two new leaders. Joyce Karel is our new Chief Commercial Officer responsible for leading our Marketing Services segment and managing our client sales and marketing efforts across the enterprise.

In 2020 we also set a strong foundation for our Marketing Services and Fulfillment Businesses  Fulfillment  Logistics businesses. We transformed our fulfillment business from a hightouch subscale B2B program focus to fullservice B2B and B2C ecommerce fulfillment powered by a cloudbased WMS and OMS. In Marketing Services we now sell integrated CRM focused on the entire customer journey and powered by decades of firstparty data experience.,HRTH,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And lastly our optimism for growth in 2021. As we look to 2021 and beyond we believe our businesses are extremely well positioned for a postCOVID world. Our three operating segments participate in large addressable markets that benefit from the ecommerce increase due to behavioral shifts from the pandemic. Were confident that this shift is a lasting trend to continue well beyond the pandemic. We have a unified gotomarket positioning as an omnichannel customer experience company and believe we have a highly differentiated products and service offering. Equally important we have strong client relationships in highgrowth categories such as Financial Services CPG Healthcare and B2B tech with room to grow and with a new leadership team focused on adding value to these relationships and beyond.,HRTH,0.999988853931427,0.9999777078495669,Positive

With that said Ill now turn it over to Lauri to go through the quarter and the full year.,HRTH,0.7884941101074219,0.5769879680800247,Positive
Thank you Andrew.,HRTH,0.9314355850219728,0.8628710883087449,Positive
As Andrew noted we have organized the company around three segments Marketing Services Fulfillment  Logistics and Customer Care and well be reporting on them moving forward. Revenues grew in our Customer Care segment by 44.5 for the quarter this was fueled by continuing project work as well as increased volumes with existing clients. Our Marketing Services business was down a modest 6.3 mostly due to reductions in our clients 2020 marketing budgets due to COVID. Fulfillment  Logistics was down 39.3 due to the elimination of our mail production facility as well as impacts due to COVID for some clients.,HRTH,0.0121631324291229,-0.9756749127357679,Negative
The companys cost reduction efforts continue to be reflected in our quarterly results which show a stabilizing business performing with consistency. Our cost cutting coupled with revenue stabilization and growth are key contributors to the positive and consistent adjusted EBITDA. This is the third quarter in a row that we are adjusted EBITDA positive at 1.9 million in Q4. With respect to new business I am pleased to report that our current weighted pipeline is 14.8 million. Our unweighted pipeline is 41 million both of which remain strong heading into 2021.,HRTH,0.9813462495803832,0.9626924769237497,Positive
As Andrew has described part of our optimization efforts include continuing to focus on streamlining and restructuring the business to meet the needs of the market today and we are encouraged by the stabilization and growth in the business lines where were investing. Id now like to walk through the quarterly results in more detail. Fourth quarter revenues were 47.1 million compared to 52.3 million in the year ago quarter for a yearoveryear revenue decline of 5.2 million or 10. Our operating expenses for the fourth quarter were 47.4 million down from 51.9 million in the year ago quarter. We reduced our operating expenses in labor and production and distribution the decreases were driven from reduction in transportation and facility expenses as well as expenses related to the closure of our mail facilities.,HRTH,0.960551619529724,0.921103192033286,Positive
Operating loss came in at 368000 versus operating income of 785000 in Q3 and 422000 in the year ago quarter. We generated GAAP net income of 1 million or 0.12 and 0.11 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter respectively. This compares to a GAAP net loss of 3 million or 0.49 per basic and diluted share in the yearago period. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was 1.9 million compared to 3 million in the same period last year.,HRTH,0.0965531170368194,-0.8068948429196138,Negative
Now turning to the full year results. Revenues for 2020 were 176.9 million compared to 217.6 million last year for a yearoveryear revenue decline of 40.7 million or 18.7. By segment 2020 revenue in Marketing Services was 67.1 million compared to 66.2 million in 2019. Operating income in this segment was 5 million compared to 4.7 million in 2019. The cost reductions that we made enabled us to achieve the increase in operating income despite the yearoveryear decline in revenue. Customer care had a strong performance for the year with revenue at 58.7 million in 2020 versus 48.4 million in 2019. Operating income was 5.8 million up from a loss of 4.8 million a year ago. This is an increase of 10.6 million yearoveryear.,HRTH,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In Fulfillment  Logistics Services revenue declined to 61.1 million from 103 million in 2019 while operating loss was 2.7 million compared to a loss of 1.1 million in 2019. As a reminder this segment includes our mail production facilities that were shut down during Q2 of this year. Our operating expenses for the full year 2020 were 187.5 million compared to 239.2 million in 2019 a decrease of 51.7 million or 21.6. The 51.7 million decline in operating expenses more than offset the 40.7 million decline in revenues adding to our momentum of improved financial results. We reduced our operating expenses in all areas including labor production and distribution and advertising selling general and administrative expenses to offset the decline in revenue.,HRTH,0.0389705300331115,-0.9220600855708634,Negative
Our restructuring expenses for the full year of 2020 totaled 9.4 million compared to 11.8 million in 2019. As a result of our aggressive cost efficiency efforts operating loss was 10.6 million for the full year of 2020 a major improvement to the 2019 operating loss of 21.6 million in 2019. We expect to continue this momentum in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2020 improved to positive 3.2 million compared to a loss of 3.4 million in 2019.,HRTH,0.0042879581451416,-0.9914252706916754,Negative
We now have the three quarters of positive adjusted EBITDA in a row for 2020. Adjusting for the nonrecurring restructuring and impairment expenses our adjusted operating loss was 436000 compared to a loss of 8.7 million in 2019. Net loss for the full year 2020 was 1.7 million or 0.34 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of 26.3 million or 4.26 per basic and diluted share in 2019. Net loss in 2020 included an income tax benefit of 16.6 million. We are expecting an additional tax refund of 7.5 million by the end of 2021 related to our 2020 NOL carry back.,HRTH,0.0008321702480316,-0.998336850605518,Negative
Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity. As of December 31 2020 we had cash and cash equivalents of 29.4 million this compares to a cash balance of 28.1 million as of the period ended December 31 2019. We also as of December 31 2020 had 22.2 million in longterm debt which reflects the current draw on our 19 million revolving credit facility as well as the longterm portion of our PPP note. We believe we have sufficient balance sheet strength to continue executing on our transformation plan and fund future growth.,HRTH,0.2534161210060119,-0.4931686479858447,Negative
With that I will turn it back over to the operator to take your questions.,HRTH,0.9373372197151184,0.874674364730337,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,HRTH,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. Operator Instructions We can now go to the line of Michael Kupinski of NOBLE Capital Markets. Please go ahead sir.,HRTH,0.999600887298584,0.9992017741213883,Positive
Thank you and congratulations on your quarter and positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter. I know you operate in a very difficult environment as many media companies and you did  you executed very well. I appreciate that. So a couple of questions. Since the company is organized now into three operating segments can you kind of talk a little bit about how each segment is where there  where most of the revenue is derived from like in terms of categories like for instance maybe you could just talk about the accounts or  what accounts for large portions of the revenues in each one of those segments,HRTH,0.9999949932098388,0.999989986413709,Positive
Yes we can  I can start and obviously well give you client categories. So our Marketing Services business is essentially a CRM business a CRM agency that has a few components in it everything from strategy to creative to technology to implement email solutions. So when you think about that business and as we think about that business you would look at competitors within the big holding companies in their CRM pureplay agencies. Our Fulfillment  Logistics business does multiple aspects today of fulfillment literature fulfillment product fulfillment and then we also do trade marketing fulfillment would be the three biggest categories.,HRTH,0.9953727722167968,0.9907455389175048,Positive
As youre aware theres been a decline in literature fulfillment as a category as theres less printing as a whole. So when you look at three components of the business as it stands today we see growth in product fulfillment which is obviously what B2B and B2C ecommerce is about. That is ecommerce product fulfillment. And then our Customer Care business as I mentioned on the call is transforming and the majority of the revenue those are all based on a number of seats with any given client for the services. What I would say is that the transformation that weve made has been to offer more technology services as well. And so we see that business transforming as well over time.,HRTH,0.9902595281600952,0.9805190447086363,Positive
Got it. And in terms of your Customer Care obviously a big jump in the revenues in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that revenue is what you would I guess call recurring or onetime in nature,HRTH,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Lauri do you want to give a sense for what we think that would be now,HRTH,0.9395232796669006,0.8790464872398895,Positive
Sure. I think we have seen a great increase in that. And some of what we thought would be shortterm project work that continued into longer than we had planned. But theres still a portion maybe between 10 and 20 that what we would consider project work thats not necessarily recurring. But I think that theres still opportunities to continue to grow that and expand in some of that project work that we can continue to do even if its six months to a yearlong project rather than a short period.,HRTH,0.0462318658828735,-0.9075374052151474,Negative
And it looks like we are pretty pretty much through the first quarter here. Can you just kind of give us a sense on how each one of these divisions or segments are performing into the first quarter,HRTH,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. And so as we look at the first quarter and beyond and weve talked about this before and talked about how we believe weve stabilized top line revenue and obviously now need to get these businesses towards growth and are continuing to improve EBITDA for each of those businesses. So we see that continuing in the fourth quarter and beyond.,HRTH,0.9947900772094728,0.9895801482082298,Positive
Okay. And then youve mentioned that you have ongoing cost reduction efforts. Can you provide some thought in terms of what annualized cost savings might be in 2021,HRTH,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes I think its 2021 and beyond. Lauri if you want to touch on that and maybe touch on the ERP implementation as well,HRTH,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure. I mean as we stated we cut from  through restructuring efforts over 20 million. Certainly some of our costs normally would fluctuate with the revenue. Were continuing through our restructuring that we expect to complete in 2021. And as you know weve discussed before reducing our facilities footprint has certainly been a focus as well as some IT projects weve had going on. Were also embarking on an implementation of a new cloudbased ERP system that we expect to drive additional efficiency in the business and enable us to reduce costs further in the coming years especially in our overheadrelated costs.,HRTH,0.9669772386550904,0.9339544379439582,Positive
Got you. And in terms of  I know the efforts last year were  and a year before were to reduce thirdparty vendors cost and so forth. Where do you stand on most of your thirdparty vendors at this point in terms of further cost reductions there Or are you satisfied to cut most of the cost that you need to in that area,HRTH,0.9077379703521729,0.8154758307193701,Positive
Yes we have. First of all with regards to third pay vendors we have completely. Secondly weve also  and weve discussed this in the past our goal is to be as assetlight and thats not just from a real estate footprint standpoint which weve made tremendous progress over the last few years. But also in terms of technology as an example. So in our Fulfillment  Logistics business were moving towards a much more open architecture OMS WMS and reducing our own internal labor for development. So not only are we not reliant going forward on thirdparty vendors but were also not reliant on fixed cost or we wont be as reliant on fixed cost to maintain systems and deliver our work.,HRTH,0.7714715003967285,0.5429427283660939,Positive
And then finally just a clarification. You guys gave information on the pipeline of business. Can you just kind of give me a sense of how we should look at the numbers that you provided in terms of how this translates into revenue going forward and over what time frame,HRTH,0.9989566802978516,0.9979133593519685,Positive
Yes. So the  as weve talked about we like to see the weighted pipeline thats weighted at 75 or higher on conversion likeliness to convert at  tracking at about 15 million. Obviously the quality of a pipeline is as important as the numbers. Where we feel encouraged is that the quality of what is in there is of higher quality than in the past.,HRTH,0.9993348717689514,0.9986697427450077,Positive
So what I mean by that is by design and how were selling it our clients and prospects are engaging with more than one service as an example. So its a higher quality higher ticket item but its also leveraging more services. So one way to look at it obviously is that number. But the other way which is obviously tougher to see is the quality. And as we announce more and more client wins and you see the types of client wins thats another way to see the transition and the work that were doing which is towards higher margin higher ticket item work across all of our businesses.,HRTH,0.9969608783721924,0.9939217531214672,Positive

Thank you Omar. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Volt Information Sciences first quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. On the call today are Linda Perneau President and Chief Executive Officer and Herb Mueller Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.,VOLT,0.9999932050704956,0.999986410132891,Positive
After the market closed this afternoon the company issued a press release announcing its results for the first quarter fiscal year 2021. The release is available on the companys website at volt.com as well as the EDGAR SEC website filed as a Form 8K. We have also prepared a supplemental presentation which is available on the Investor Relations section of the companys website.,VOLT,0.9633969068527222,0.9267937700711311,Positive
Before beginning todays prepared remarks I would like to remind you that some of the statements made will be forwardlooking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected or implied due to a variety of factors including but not limited to potential impacts of the COVID19 pandemic on our business operations.

Technical difficulty management will reference certain nonGAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors. A reconciliation of those to GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release issued this afternoon.,VOLT,0.2340710461139679,-0.5318588208310728,Negative
With that I would like to turn the call over to Volts President and CEO Linda Perneau. Linda,VOLT,0.9127888679504396,0.8255776319370463,Positive
Thank you Joe and welcome everyone. Today Ill begin with some brief commentary on the current labor market and recent economic shifts signaling positive signs for our industry and also share top level highlights of our Q1 results. Herb will then provide additional detail and insight into our financial performance. And I will conclude with an overview of actions occurring in each of our business units to ensure continued momentum.,VOLT,0.9990661144256592,0.9981322277380393,Positive
The old phrase what a difference a year makes certainly summed up the sentiment of the past several months. As we eclipsed the 1year anniversary of the pandemic onset we are seeing several key indicators that support improving economic and labor conditions globally. Positive COVID cases have decreased significantly after hitting their highest levels during the recent winter months.,VOLT,0.2076877951622009,-0.5846253541859117,Negative
More recently positive cases seem to be leveling off as the race to distribute and administer COVID vaccine has begun. Since distribution began in December of 2020 over 100 million doses have been administered in the United States. Recently the CDC indicated that at the current pace 70 to 80 of the American population should receive at least the first dose of the vaccine indicating herd immunity by September of this year. This is fueling optimism as children begin their return to school anticipation heightens for the ongoing reopening of all counties and states and comfort levels increase as even minimal activities that mirror the old norm occur.,VOLT,0.0115545094013214,-0.9768921595169064,Negative
Internationally however the trends suggest somewhat of a slower recovery pattern. Despite over 64 million vaccine doses administered to date in the locations Volt operates within Europe Asia Pacific and India recent recurring shutdowns and the introduction of new COVID19 variants has led to a nonlinear recovery.,VOLT,0.0825426280498504,-0.8349158375953661,Negative
Looking back during March and April in 2020 more than 21 million jobs were lost across the U.S. Through February of 21 nearly 12.8 million jobs have been gained closing nearly 60 of the gap. Industries such as health care specifically those providing travel nurses leisure and hospitality retail trade and manufacturing have led the way on the game. Even better news on the U.S. job front temporary jobs are recovering at an even faster pace.,VOLT,0.9593112468719482,0.9186224452390941,Positive
Since having lost nearly 1 million jobs last March and April the temporary jobs segment has gained back nearly 76 of the lost jobs as of this February. This is consistent with what were experiencing particularly in the manufacturing logistics and food distribution industry. Constraints on the talent supply continue to be our greatest challenge in fulfillment. We anticipate with broader distribution of the vaccine combined with less state county and city restrictions this situation will improve.,VOLT,0.0188559889793396,-0.9622891916568229,Negative
As was the case with my earlier comments regarding international trends we continue to see less substantive uplift in job openings. Speaking specifically about the United Kingdom the number of new job postings remained broadly unchanged throughout the countrys third lockdown which began in early January as companies across multiple industries wait out the restriction.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
A glimmer of optimism was recently shared by the Recruitment  Employment Confederation highlighting a 52 increase in jobs posted in the first week of March 21 than in the first week of April 20 and 31 more than in the first week of July 20 synonymous with the initial recovery in the U.S. Despite these certain COVID19 business disruptions continuing domestically and abroad the signs of an ongoing recovery which for Volt began in the latter half of fiscal 2020 are encouraging.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
As we have previously reported we realized consistent monthly sequential improvement beginning in July 2020 coming from a combination of new business wins existing client expansion and the return of certain clients to or near their prepandemic levels. This set the stage for strong momentum as we entered fiscal 21 in November.,VOLT,0.7446725368499756,0.4893447693257149,Positive
And although we remain in the midst of ongoing pandemic headwinds albeit less impactful than prior year our first quarter 2021 revenue was higher than the prepandemic level 1year ago. For Q1 we achieved both positive GAAP and positive adjusted revenue growth for the first time in 2 years. Positive EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter and positive Q1 EBITDA for the first time in at least 6 years.,VOLT,0.9331048727035522,0.866209665661851,Positive
The outlook for Q2 also remained quite positive despite experiencing widespread shutdowns due to Februarys winter storm and the 7 weeks in the prior year quarter unaffected by COVID related shutdown.,VOLT,0.0236791372299194,-0.9526428894060192,Negative
Let me now turn the call over to Herb to provide additional details on the overall financials and Q2 outlook. Herb,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Linda. Revenue for the first quarter of FY 21 on a GAAP basis was 218 million compared to 217.8 million in the prior year comparable quarter a slight improvement. After adjusting for currency translations and the MSP delivery model shift overall company revenue was up 0.9 million due to continued improvements in our North American staffing segment which posted positive yearoveryear revenue growth for the first time in 2 years during the quarter.,VOLT,0.9330072402954102,0.8660144007291799,Positive
During Q1 FY 21 our Direct Hire line of business continued to show improvement. For the quarter we were down 1.3 from the prior year quarter. However we were up 2.4 sequentially from Q4 2020. Direct Hire revenue within our North American staffing segment was higher versus the prior year quarter but was offset by a decline within our international segment.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Looking at Q1 2021 adjusted revenue for each segment our North American staffing segment reported adjusted revenue of 184.2 million an increase of 2.2 from the prior year. Adjusted revenue for our international staffing segment was 24 million down 12.9 from the prior year and our North American MSP segment reported adjusted revenue of 9.7 million a 2.6 improvement from prior year.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The improvement in our North American staffing segment began in the second half of fiscal 2020 continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2021. And for the first time since first quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted revenue for this segment increased from the prior year comparable quarter. The 2.2 increase is primarily attributable to new business wins on a combination of retail and mid market logos combined with the expansion of business within existing clients.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our International Staffing segment decreased 3.6 million or 12.9 primarily due to lower demand in the U.K. and a decline in contractor headcount which resulted from reductions clients made in anticipation of legislation that wants to take effect in April 2020. We believe the negative impact from that has occurred and were rebuilding that business.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our North American MSP segment was up 0.2 million or 2.6 from prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increased demand in the payroll service business. Gross margin for Q1 2021 was 15 compared to 14.4 and the prior year comparable quarter primarily due to a 30 basis point benefit from government wage subsidies and a 20 basis point benefit from improved workers compensation claims experience.,VOLT,0.0260009169578552,-0.9479993271823688,Negative
Our North American Staffing segment margin increase was primarily due to these lower employee related costs as well as a mix of higher margin business. Our International Staffing segment gross margins as a percentage of revenue increased due to a shift away from lower margin business. North American MSP decreased 310 basis points due to an increase in our payroll service.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
SGA expense for Q1 2021 was 33.7 million compared to 39.5 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease of 5.8 million was primarily due to strategic cost reductions including 3.6 million in labor and related costs to the lower headcount partially offset by higher incentives on the increased sales volume. 1.3 million in lower facility costs due to consolidating our real estate footprint and 0.6 million in lower professional fees.,VOLT,0.0291151702404022,-0.9417708169047934,Negative
Restructuring and severance costs in the first quarter of 2021 primarily included 0.3 million of severance costs and 0.6 million related to ongoing costs of facilities impaired in the second half of fiscal 2020 offset by a 0.3 million lease termination gain. The prior year quarter included charges primarily related to the strategic initiative cost to offshore a significant number of rolls to our operations in Bangalore India.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operating loss for the quarter improved 7.6 million to 1.7 million compared to a loss of 9.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The yearoveryear improvement is a result of the actions previously mentioned. Adjusted operating income for North American Staffing segment was 6.2 million compared to 0.1 million a year ago. International Staffing adjusted operating income remained flat at 0.4 million and North American MSP adjusted operating income declined 0.2 million.,VOLT,0.2015756368637085,-0.5968496780691612,Negative
For Q1 2021 we reported a GAAP net loss of 2.4 million or 0.11 per share compared to a loss of 10.8 million or 0.50 per share in the prior year comparable quarter. This improvement was primarily due to the 14.6 reduction in operating expenses related to strategic cost initiatives as well as lower nonoperating expenses and restructuring and severance costs. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2021 improved by 6.5 million to a positive 0.9 million as compared to a negative 5.6 million in the prior year comparable quarter.,VOLT,0.0194699466228485,-0.9610612756379102,Negative
Moving on to a few key items from cash flow in the balance sheet. At the end of Q1 21 we had 40.1 million in cash and equivalents and an additional 11.9 million in restricted cash and shortterm investments an increase of 12.6 million combined with the prior year and 7.4 million decrease from the prior quarter.,VOLT,0.1428150534629821,-0.7143709149187298,Negative
Our longterm debt remained the same as last quarter at 60 million and total availability  total available liquidity increased slightly from 24 million in October to 24.2 million in January. We use 6.5 million in cash flow from operations as a result of the increase in accounts receivable in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 with capital expenditures of 1 million,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Looking towards the second quarter we expect revenue to improve 5 to 7 over last year. We expect gross margin percent to be in line with last years the factors which impacted gross margin in Q1 are anticipated to continue. As a reminder last year we had a 60 basis point improvement due to a positive workers comp expense adjustment representing a 2x to 3x higher adjustment than typically realized.,VOLT,0.22884202003479,-0.5423168792229172,Negative
SGA should continue to be in the 33 million to 34 million range which still represents a substantial reduction from the prior year. This coupled with our favorable revenue trends creates a significant opportunity for us to achieve operating income EBITDA improvements over the prior year quarter. Overall coming out of a difficult fiscal 2020 with solid momentum Linda and I are encouraged with the performance in the first quarter of 2021. We remain confident we are back on the projected growth trajectory to return to profitability in 2021.,VOLT,0.1430510580539703,-0.7138989054554138,Negative
Ill now turn the call back over to Linda. Linda,VOLT,0.1477690041065216,-0.7044630077260778,Negative
Thank you Herb. Our Q1 results are the combination of improving economic and labor trends growing confidence in vaccine distribution increased buying activity strong safety protocols enforced by clients of all sizes dedicated field employees who continue to show up and expertly represent Volt Daily and of course the hard work and resilience of every Volt colleague globally.,VOLT,0.9847672581672668,0.9695344981756795,Positive
Despite varying headwinds each of our business units International North American MSP and North American Staffing had both sequential and per day revenue improvement when comparing Q1 2021 to Q4 2020. Of most notable improvement is North American Staffing which in addition to the above mentioned improvements also delivered adjusted revenue growth of 2.2 over prior year. This segment had strong performance across the entire organization and continues to build upon the steps that have been taken over the last 2 years.,VOLT,0.9986830949783324,0.9973661883867908,Positive
Our branch network continues to demonstrate promising progress on the retail front. This typically with small to midsized local clients. We continue to invest in multiple markets to fuel growth and since our last earnings call have expanded in a couple of markets in the Southeast.,VOLT,0.0895257294178009,-0.8209496265349546,Negative
Our focus remains on the ongoing development and training of each colleague in this area. As we continue to conduct virtual boot camp and expand specific training and individual coaching around Direct Hire opportunities I am pleased with how the teams have responded to and executed against the discipline required in this model and expect that dynamic to continue to positively impact our future performance.,VOLT,0.9896501302719116,0.9793002482058097,Positive
On the large enterprise client side we continue to see increased buying activity specifically in the areas of call center manufacturing logistics and food distribution. Our teams are capitalizing on expansion opportunities as well as winning new logos and across all business units we have healthy pipeline leaving me encouraged about future win potential. We continue to source quality talent to add to both our mid to large account and branch network sales team and we will continue to invest to accelerate top line performance.,VOLT,0.9995155334472656,0.9990310663170017,Positive
As has been the case since July 2020 order volume and placement volume remains well above preCOVID timeframe despite constrained talent supply. Last quarter we discussed the progress we have made leveraging chatbot technology to assist with candidate attraction screening and engagement. As was planned we have completed the second phase of expansion of usage across select clients within our North American Staffing organization.,VOLT,0.9970600605010986,0.9941201174975143,Positive
Our next expansion is planned for the end of March as we continue to focus on enhancing the candidate experience increasing candidate pipeline and meeting the demands of our clients quickly and more effectively. We will continue to leverage our current technology and explore additional technology and talent platform designed to enhance not only the candidate experience but also to provide development and up skilling opportunities demonstrating our commitment to developing the workforce of the future. We will continue to share more details as we progress.,VOLT,0.999974012374878,0.9999480247187764,Positive
Our MSP segment providing total talent solutions to clients looking for an outsourced approach to sourcing engaging and managing contingent workforce continues to demonstrate slight recovery from the initial pandemic impact. This segment was extensively impacted by the decline of two large clients early in March and new sales wins slowed as a result of limited buying activity throughout the last year.,VOLT,0.9082649946212769,0.8165298798858402,Positive
As we have reported RSP ph activity has gradually improved in the last several months. Although these are generally long sales cycles but generate significant margin uplift when new wins occur. We are fortunate to have a strong tenured team with extensive experience coupled with the agility and flexibility to offer scalable solutions for smaller and more complex programs globally. Our unprecedented client tenure is a testament to the outstanding program solution and partnership our MSP teams provide. We remain confident in a promising outlook for this segment.,VOLT,0.9987399578094482,0.9974799141168083,Positive
On the international front despite the ongoing headwinds previously referenced we are beginning to realize incremental improvement specifically in the U.K. The outlook for this segment also remains promising and should continue to gain momentum as lockdowns end and a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated. In summary I concur with Herb. Our performance throughout the pandemic and in the first quarter leaves us well poised to continue the projected growth trajectory and return to profitability in fiscal 2021.,VOLT,0.9258748292922974,0.8517495702204527,Positive
Before I turn the call over for questions I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our Volt colleagues around the world. Our teams have been working relentlessly to provide superior service to our clients ensure the safety and continued employment of our field employees and secure new business opportunities enabling essential and impactful work to be completed. They have reacted swiftly embrace the new way of operating capital challenges head on all with Volts best interest in mind.,VOLT,0.9998343586921692,0.9996687171868783,Positive
I would also like to thank our valued clients who continue to trust us to be their workforce solutions partner our field employees who trust us with their career choices and of course our shareholders and Board of Directors whose support gives us the necessary motivation to excel.,VOLT,0.9980101585388184,0.9960203147055595,Positive

QuestionandAnswer Session,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions And our first question comes from Josh Vogel with Sidoti  Company. Please proceed.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. Good afternoon Linda and Herb. Hope you both doing well.,VOLT,0.9998902082443236,0.9997804163577653,Positive
Doing great. Thanks Josh.,VOLT,0.9983197450637816,0.9966394881245422,Positive
Great. Good to hear. Certainly impressive results coming out of fiscal 2020. I had a couple questions for you here. I guess the first point obviously really impressive step down in SGA yearoveryear and on a fairly similar base of revenue. So when we look at the savings when you think about labor facility costs professional fees what do you think is permanent and what may come back this year as volume picks up,VOLT,0.9999319314956664,0.9998638629101888,Positive
Well the reductions that we had are permanent. However as weve mentioned before as we start growing and adding top line we will be bringing back additional people into our sales force as we see opportunity to really be able to capitalize on that. I think weve got a fair amount of room in our back office to not have to bring on additional support to support more revenue but certainly on the revenue sales side I think theres some opportunity there that well take advantage of and make sure that were doing what we can out in the field.,VOLT,0.999998927116394,0.9999978542315091,Positive
Thats helpful. That actually kind of leads into my next question. I think on the last call you quantify that revenue per employee increased I think like a third in the U.S. I was just  any thoughts you have around your current indiscernible recruiter bench and the existing capacity How much is left there before you have to meaningfully add headcount,VOLT,0.8614251613616943,0.7228501575292097,Positive
Yes so Ill pick that one Josh. We  it varies right. So the answer to that really varies depending upon what location what area of the country the specific dynamic that may be happening in any one particular location. We look at productivity we look at it regularly. Its a metric that we measure to its a metric that our folks are incented by. So its a very important metric for us. And we know that a certain productivity level in teams hit the glass ceiling and they just simply cannot cannot grow. And when we see that approaching were very quick to make an investment right Were making investments as we win new business as we win new on site as were seeing a lot of our clients expand and buying activity pick up. So  and then in other areas we still have significant bandwidth where those productivity levels are lower might be more of a startup branch or might be an area where were just really looking to leverage. So it varies but it is something that we monitor very closely. What we will continue to do to Herbs point is certainly look for additional cost savings opportunities as we leverage technology and identify cost savings. And some of that will be offset by investments that will continue to make to fuel the growth.,VOLT,0.9999993443489076,0.9999986886970336,Positive
That makes sense. And I guess one last one about the cost side of things. Just general comments around how the back office how things are going in India and you see many potential opportunities to move any more funds over there,VOLT,0.0609265565872192,-0.8781480062890091,Negative
Josh I think things right now are going very very well. Weve been extremely pleased with the progress that weve made there. Our team has gotten up to speed very very quickly both from an accounting and shared service side. Weve got metrics on their performance and they continue to come in excellent. Weve had a few people that havent worked out as you have in any situation and weve dealt with that situation quickly. And have really been very pleased. We went through weve got a fair amount of accounting support there. We just went through our yearend audit last December and it was one of the cleanest audits weve had we just had Q1 and Q1 was done extremely well. So were very pleased. Going forward were continuing to look is there an opportunity or not certainly any time that we have a position that opens up through attrition or whatever we evaluate. Does it make sense for us to replace that position in India or do we need to do it here and were handling that by case by case basis.,VOLT,0.9999927282333374,0.9999854564580062,Positive
Sure. Okay great. And now switching to the revenue results very encouraging ph to see what you put up in North America and I dont know if its easy to quantify but when we think about 2.2 increase on an adjusted basis what would that have looked like without COVID related impact because I think you did quite a number in and around 100 million for last year I was just curious what was in this quarter And then when we think about the growth you saw on the quarter how much came from new client wins versus expansion with existing clients.,VOLT,0.9975050687789916,0.9950101345837916,Positive
So this is what makes the 2.2 even more exciting Josh is that keep in mind first quarter of last year was prepandemic. So these teams in North American staffing managed to deliver these results in a prepandemic timeframe.,VOLT,0.989501953125,0.9790038937353454,Positive
Yes of course. Even also impressive given your commentary around for Q2 because the first seven weeks of that quarter. If I heard you right Herb you said you expect revenue to be up 5 to 7 yearoveryear. In Q2  okay great. And so then you  can you maybe give a sense of the drag from the winter storms that are built in that. If we didnt have that what would that growth look like,VOLT,0.9949977993965148,0.9899955928299382,Positive
Yes and were still seeing some impact from that because you had the initial shutdown that occurred especially in Texas and Tennessee where literally in Texas especially for a week long we had clients that were down. And then the other thing is the supply chain interruption. So we actually saw cutbacks in states that were not affected by the ice storms but indirectly because they couldnt get the indiscernible the supply chain was disrupted. And were still seeing a little bit of impact from that. And thats part of kind of the range and if that doesnt recover quickly youll see us on the low end of that range. If it rebounds quickly and youve got things making up we could do a little bit better but we  overall it hasnt been horrendous but also keep in mind that youve not only had the big ice storm that hit Texas and Tennessee but before that you also had really bad weather in the Northeast the Midwest has been getting hit Denver just got indiscernible. So thats something  that is something were watching closely but right now theres an impact there 1 to 2 potentially but knock on wood not much more than that.,VOLT,5.960464477539062e-07,-1.0,Negative
Okay. But I can certainly attest to some lousy weather in the Northeast this past winter. Just one last one I will hop back in the queue. Just thinking about North America retail midmarket logos how much business do they make up It was running at a 20 is that still the case And whats your target for retail mid market logos as it progresses,VOLT,0.7623610496520996,0.5247218160163261,Positive
Yes. So we came in basically at that same rate. We had  it did increase but so did the enterprise businesses as well. So we were pleased with both of those and well continue to have emphasis longterm. Wed love to see that be 30 of our mix how fast we can get there well  itll probably be kind of a step basis as its going but its still certainly a high priority for us.,VOLT,0.9997140169143676,0.9994280334878165,Positive

Operator Instructions And our next question is from Mike Hughes with SGF Capital.,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is do you have the deferred payroll balance And then the second question is can you just kind of outline the 3 EBITDA goal What needs to happen to get there as far as a retail mix maybe on the Direct Hire front and MSP and other factors,VOLT,0.9906104803085328,0.9812209494238793,Positive
Sure. Mike on the deferred payroll tax its just a hair under 26 million of which 13 million of that  half of that will be due in the end of December of this year. And thats currently shown now as a current liability. And then going into the following year youve got another just a hair under 13 million that will be due at the end of 2022. And then as far as the 3 mixers multiple components of that one is the retail that we just talked about and ultimately striving to get that to the 30 of our business and then growth in our Direct Hire as a key priority for us now. And then the other major third leg of that is just better pricing through our existing business and new business continuing to get better margins and better pricing on what we do as well as overall cost control.,VOLT,0.990138292312622,0.9802765728691651,Positive
Okay. And if you put a timeframe on that,VOLT,0.8783620595932007,0.7567239741825904,Positive
Unidentified Company Representative,VOLT,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes so really looking at that by the end of FY 23.,VOLT,0.9128326177597046,0.8256651316077301,Positive
Okay. And then I apologize just one other. Could you repeat your commentary around the gross margin for the April quarter what you said on that front,VOLT,0.903270661830902,0.8065412083513783,Positive
We expect it to be very similar to last years and again I threw out thats actually implying underlying improvement because last year we had 60 basis points. That onetime workers comp typically we get a 20 to 30 basis point improvement on our workers compared estimate. And last year it was just unusually high which really beat us up. So really still trying to come up and hit last years number which will indicate some improvement in some of the underlying fundamentals and gross margin.,VOLT,0.844917356967926,0.6898345290628249,Positive
Okay. I mean thats I think it was 1.1 million that youve benefited from last year. So thats a big hurdle that youre going to overcome. So is that primarily from Direct Hire Or whats going to drive that kind of core expansion,VOLT,0.8761012554168701,0.7522023631348391,Positive
Yes so a combination of things embedded in that is we do expect to have  maybe close to half of that other workers comp benefit that we could still see 400000 to 500000. Theyre also potentially some additional wage subsidies government wage subsidies to come in. And then on top of that certainly Direct Hire and overall our business mix with no improvement on our retail business. So theres just a variety of components that will come into that.,VOLT,0.9756336212158204,0.9512672133846365,Positive

Well good morning and its my pleasure to welcome Fabrizio Campelli the Chief Transformation Officer and Member of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank. And actually Im very pleased to say second year in a row welcome Fabrizio.,DB,0.9999346733093262,0.9998693465407769,Positive
Thank you very much.,DB,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Absolutely. Before we start our fireside chat weve got a polling question for you. And its actually quite simple. Its on your screens. And it says what do you see as the single biggest driver for Deutsche Banks share price in 2021 And of course weve got the resilience of IP revenues. Weve got the cost efficiencies NII defense capital resilience and MA. Well come back to the  to that polling question maybe a little bit later.,DB,0.913365602493286,0.8267311017102608,Positive
So Fabrizio lets start with the investment bank. Of course the kind of the trends have been strong across the industry. Weve heard about it over the last kind of two days. And of course you yourselves Christian at the yearend talked about a strong start to the year. So can I just ask how has the kind of quarter continued And also kind of how do you see the seasonality of the ID ph revenues as the year progresses,DB,0.9968092441558838,0.993618484508088,Positive
Thank you Magdalena. Very happy to be here again the second year in a row with you. We did have some of that language in our Q4 results. Christian did speak about good momentum being carried into 2021 from what was a strong 2020. And I have to say six weeks into  later into the year so towards the end of the first quarter that momentum has continued quite strongly. And in fact quartertodate were seeing revenues being up in the Investment Bank by about 20. And this is across the franchise so in Origination  Advisory as well as in FIC and in particular in Credit Trading. So a good performance across the Investment Bank.,DB,0.9999984502792358,0.9999969005566243,Positive
Fabrizio do you want to kind of take it a little bit kind of further for us Because of course the investment kind of banking revenues are kind of also key to your overall group targets. Do you expect the year to be  of course so far weve seen it very strongly. I mean 20 a very high number. But does  do the comps get  of course the comps get much harder as we go through the year.,DB,0.0940917432308197,-0.8118175934658012,Negative
Yes. Of course. I mean we did describe our 2020 performance as one that had some outperformance related to market circumstances. That were not easy to replicate. And yet we also were very clear in our Investor Day in December that we saw a substantial portion of that outperformance actually being resilient and sustained and sustainable into future years. And I think what were seeing right now is exactly that strategy playing out. So its early to tell how the full 2020 will play out but clearly were very encouraged by this start of the year in the business. Also because we see the performance like I said not focused on one particular business only but distributed across our franchises and thats true for LDCM for the DCM franchise obviously for ECM as well as in FIC.,DB,0.9983153343200684,0.9966306666318576,Positive
I think it speaks to not just the momentum in the Investment Bank but the fact that we have our core businesses really having shown great resilience last year and carrying resilience into this year. And it speaks to a certain amount of positive momentum that the bank is experiencing. And we expect that momentum not to abate due to seasonality but in fact to continue strongly. So notwithstanding the fact that some of our businesses obviously do experience seasonality but the indicators we get the pipelines the activity the volumes of inflows in those businesses in which it matters are actually quite positive. So 2021 its early days but so far things are going quite well. And in fact as I just told you Investment Bank better than well.,DB,0.9948638677597046,0.9897277293966589,Positive
Perfect. Thank you very much. Very very encouraging. Now lets kind of look into the transformation of the bank. Youve kind of  youve mentioned a little bit offered on the Investment Banking side kind of already. But youre in the job for 15 months. So what are your kind of key takeaways kind of so far The greatest challenges particularly last year and particularly at the backdrop of the pandemic.,DB,0.9999486804008484,0.999897360740519,Positive
Yes. I have been in the job for 15 months. And the job was established to actually support the consequent execution of our strategy. We announced a strategy in July 2019. Shortly thereafter the Transformation Office was set up. And the purpose was really to give us that systematic focus on executing on a strategy which was predicated on focusing on businesses in which we wanted to compete to win. The execution clearly has gone to our plan in 2020. And I think it has been the result of a number of ingredients. A lot of effort that has gone into the preparation of the strategy and the Transformation Office there has contributed to creating the structure around it. I spoke bit about it at the investor detail. Weve broken the executional strategy down into 20 initiatives about 70 key deliverables 800 milestones. We monitor 130 risk 130 dependencies between initiatives. Its to create structure and to mitigate the risk of the execution of those longterm strategic building blocks of our execution in any way to go offtrack.,DB,0.1539909243583679,-0.692019159805274,Negative
We also built a lot of mechanisms as part of the Transformation Office to stay on track on shorterterm measures and in a way that would allow us to stay focused on the longterm priorities but also respond tactically to shortterm challenges. Little did we know when we set the office up that way that COVID would really force us into a lot of these shortterm management of difficulty. But things have gone particularly well in 2020 because we have been able to stick to the longterm priorities. As I indicated at the end of the year in our Investor Day over 90 of our milestones were met over 130 of the custom  that we were targeting to reduce as part of the key deliverables of the specific transformation initiatives were achieved. And so the program is clearly delivering its goals. And on the short term more tactical measures weve also been able to support the bank quite proactively in countering the effects of the crisis which clearly did have an impact on our ability to execute.,DB,0.9989781379699708,0.9979562747217865,Positive
And there were some challenges. Think about for example where in the spring we announced that we had to put a restructuring on hold not to plunge our employees into what was at that point in time an untenable uncertainty. And when we did that we had to found countermeasures to stay on track on costs as we did because we did end up closing the years at a 19.5 billion of cost.,DB,0.0072185397148132,-0.9855641040588046,Negative
I have to say a very important aspect of this was really creating and then riding on the positive momentum that was good generated within DB. I think the whole market in 2020 and in 2021 has seen some things that have supported particularly banks with our business model. But what was specific about Deutsche Bank is that that momentum we saw from employees from our clients has really supported us into making these changes. And we see the momentum being stronger now than it was just a year ago. And the measure of that is when we call our employees 90 of our staff stands behind the strategy understands what were trying to do and they are actively supporting it.,DB,0.9989590048789978,0.997918008517032,Positive
And those are the kind of small things that make a difference. This is the difference between two three years ago the effort that was put into these transformation measures and now seeing our clients starting at seven in the morning making those phone calls until late at night supporting us to execute on what we want to do. And an example of that is also in Germany. The standing of the bank the feedback we get from our retail and commercial banks  sorry commercial clients in Germany is at a 10year high on what we are receiving.,DB,0.9823524355888368,0.964704850140125,Positive
And again showing that  the big effort and the heavy lifting that has happened in the past years is starting to pay off in the results that Deutsche Bank is showing. So my job was also to channel a lot of this energy keep us organized come up with new ideas. And we intend to carry that momentum firmly into 2021 and 2022.,DB,0.9780610799789428,0.9561221338046393,Positive
Perfect. At the investment kind of deep dive in December youve also announced a partnership with Google. And could you just elaborate what are the benefits of it And how should we think about it from the perspective of financial impact Is it a net positive kind of on the revenue side Is it net negative on the cost short term because of the I suppose upfront Investment Could you give us a sense of whats happening there,DB,0.968495786190033,0.936991534824094,Positive
Sure. The Google partnership we signed which made us the primary financial partner to Google and is actually designed to actually play right into the spirit of the transformation I outlined. Transformation we always  we often think about it being a cost play when in reality for DB its a revenue growth play a cost play a culture play. And on the cost side I mentioned a few examples. But on the revenue side as well we are really aiming to build momentum around our growth particularly by harvesting more of this crossdivisional capability which are in turn built on deepening and leveraging better our client relationships and the Google partnership plays right there.,DB,0.9119100570678712,0.8238200091242847,Positive
So we have signed this partnership with the three fundamental objectives in mind. The first one is to really change the way we develop technology going forward at Deutsche Bank. And the spirit there Bernd has been quite open about it in his speech in  at investor event in December. The spirit there is to change the way we develop our applications and using better technology that Google can make available to us in the way we architect develop and use technological infrastructure to get to a more flexible better architect and more scalable safer set of technology and application solutions to clients faster.,DB,0.9997681379318236,0.9995362755872459,Positive
The second part is innovation. Because thanks to a joint recruiting of engineers the cocreation of solutions we will be able to develop applications and make them available to clients in ways that were not possible before to us alone. And the third part actually is a cost effectiveness play because we are effectively moving to a much more variable cost base. If you think about it we move from a world in which we would buy and use our infrastructure to actually having thanks to the hyperscale model a model in which we pay for what we use.,DB,0.9890741109848022,0.978148208944922,Positive
And all of this will actually contribute to making us more innovative better client responsive and obviously enhance growth and come up with new products and new ideas that will make revenue solutions to our clients and reaching new clients possible and over time also achieve a higher level of cost efficiency. Were talking about a 10.5 year partnership we have signed. So the time horizon for many of these benefits will distribute over that period of time. And they play right into the spirit of making the strategy of Deutsche Bank a longterm one and making us sustainably profitable and competitive in the longterm.,DB,0.9999943971633912,0.9999887943201033,Positive
Brilliant. Because that actually leads me to a couple of cost questions. And I think before I go into those cost questions I think youll be  youll be pleased to know that our poll has closed and the highest answer to the share price question almost 40 is still continuing cost delivery. So no pressure on the cost questions. So of course youve lowered your 2022 cost target. And what do you see as the contribution of the Transformation Office here,DB,0.9968053698539734,0.9936107358996487,Positive
Well we did see very strong momentum on costs. And we have often spoken about the 12th consecutive quarter of adjusted cost reductions. And again that shows a very thoughtful execution of how we intend to go about the delivery of the efficiency which is one of the core tenets of the Compete To Win strategy we have announced. And we intend to keep driving that into 2021 and 2022.,DB,0.996951699256897,0.9939033948799341,Positive
I think the further reduction of our target from 17 billion to 16.7 billion in 2022 and  obviously reflects the fact that as a team we continue to see opportunities to harvest on investment made to date investments we are continuing to make in 2021. And obviously we are contributing with some of those ideas. And I described some of them. If you think about how the Transformation Office is playing into this we look at adding and catalyzing new ideas building on the cost catalyst initiative that James von Moltke started a few years ago and continuing to drive new thoughts. And some of these are relatively small like a more consistent use of tools and workflow tools to optimize our expenses.,DB,0.9998561143875122,0.9997122286034994,Positive
For example when it comes to our vendor professional service expenses some are mediumsized and larger size. We have been speaking about endtoend process reengineering as a mechanism by which we can 60 million of incremental cost in 2022 by using artificial intelligence technology partners that enable us to much faster engineering of endtoend processes. And some are more fundamental more transformative like  as the shift of attention is focusing from cost reduction in the businesses to infrastructure as much of the heavy lifting in the business has already occurred a much higher focus on endtoend process realignment and the rearchitecting from fronttoback perspective becomes a big enabler of further savings.,DB,0.0499397218227386,-0.9001216889153058,Negative
So if you think about it the big blocks were targeting a 1.4 billion of compensation  so compensation and benefits reductions as we continue to reduce our workforce costs 900 million or so of IT cost reductions that come from a number of measures from application decommissioning to more efficient application development. And there continues to be focus on those professional service costs that we are optimizing in terms of how we relate to our vendors.,DB,0.2160757184028625,-0.5678494977053987,Negative
Our COO Frank Kuhnke has worked hard on optimizing those costs and we expect another 200 million or so of costs. Incrementally were looking at new ideas that cover for example an optimized use of our space and an incremental 100 million or so is being targeted in 2022. And it will be facilitated by a number of measures weve made which include for example the consolidation of campuses in London and New York. Were moving our footprint to new and more efficient buildings which will help us reduce the overall cost target in 2022.,DB,0.9980764389038086,0.9961528755145523,Positive
So overall we remain confident in those. And this is countering also other effects that were seeing. And for example when it comes to single resolution fund based on latest guidance we are getting from the SRB. We are expecting in 2021 at least an increase to the funding of the similar solution fund relative to our assumptions. And so we expect in 2021 the charges to be to be closer to the level they were last year so just under 600 million.,DB,0.0146522223949432,-0.970696729836899,Negative
Perfect. And then Fabrizio you gave us some of the numbers but lets kind of simply come back to some kind of yearly staging of your cost declines. Because of course your cost trajectory kind of looks like a hockey stick. So weve got 1 billion in 2021. Of course at the same time with all necessary investments. Weve got 2 billion cost cuts in 2022. Now can you kind of talk to us about your level of confidence that that 2022 cost target that 16.7 billion is  I mean how difficult is it to achieve Because in real  in absolute numbers these are big saves.,DB,0.9725054502487184,0.9450108677213598,Positive
Yes. Magdalena I would point to one thing which is I wouldnt really see it as a hockey stick in the sense that from 20  end of 2018 to end of 2020 we reduced costs by 3.3 billion on an adjusted basis. And between end of 2000  to end of 2022 is now only 2.8 billion left. So in a way we have already  if anything is an inverse of that weve done the heavy lifting upfront and were now benefiting from the enormous effort that has gone into previous years.,DB,0.004402071237564,-0.991197044370797,Negative
We said very clearly I think James has also provided some transparency on this that in 2021 we decided to accelerate some of the investments that will help us make 2022 and beyond more efficient. For example we transparently show that in 2021 we decided to invest an incremental 300 million on the integration of our German IT platform. And this is an investment that will give us a benefit into 2022 but into 2023 and beyond it will be an even larger investment.,DB,0.9999637007713318,0.9999274014993915,Positive
We decided to invest more through the use of the driver based cost management in the reduction of the stranded cost into our Capital Release Unit which is why our  from the original assumption of approximately 1 billion the Capital Release Unit stranded cost expected at the end of 2022 have now dropped to 800 million. But thanks to the investment were making this year it would also carry momentum into 2023 and beyond. So overall I would say we have a strong conviction obviously into our 2022 targets. The 16.7 billion remains absolutely the number we are committed to. And we see and we have a strong plan on how to achieve that which is predicated on not just the work done so far.,DB,0.0352037549018859,-0.9295936403236631,Negative
The fact that many of the initiatives we have carried out in 2020 and 2021 will run rate into future years and so will help us get there. But also because we continue to replenish the book with new ideas thats what my office is also very heavily involved in which is giving us a comfort that the plan we have we intend to navigate with the same discipline that we have shown for the last three years with kind of the intent to continue the last 12 quarters of meeting or exceeding promises on costs to be maintained for the next three quarters.,DB,0.0004414916038513,-0.9991182083596042,Negative
Fabrizio lets move a little bit forward because of course when we originally spoke about of course the strategy back in 2019. 2022 just seemed very far away. And of course 2022 now its just kind of next year and weve talked about your  the confidence in that 16.7 billion target. When you kind of  when you cast your eye three years further how should we think about a cost base that Deutsche needs to operate with,DB,0.7951918840408325,0.5903835239312196,Positive
Its really important to understand. We start with the transformation and it was healthy for many reasons to attach absolute targets to many aspects of our plan. And so thats why there was an absolute cost target laid out for us for 2020 for 2022 and those are serving a certain purpose. As we normalize the transformation cycle we moved back to being a bank that can deliver and will deliver 8 return on tangible equity which is what our target is as we move back to having the heavy portion of the therapy behind us it will also be important to move back to a more relative measurement of cost efficiency.,DB,0.998165488243103,0.9963309742992963,Positive
So we intend after 2022 our appetite would be to move back to our cost income ratio target. And we see that for 2023 for example a level of 70 would be the level that we would target. And of course improve from there based on a number of metrics that we can see. I mentioned earlier we already see that for 2023 there will be pressure upwards on cost from a number of things but also we have a lot of measures already lined up which will blossom only fully in 2023.,DB,0.9942402839660645,0.9884805610660083,Positive
I mentioned the stranded costs in the CRU the full impact of having a single platform supporting the technology of our private bank in Germany. All of these will continue to generate positive momentum. But again we will have the heavy part of transformation behind us at that point and not giving up any discipline because we will be very focused on sticking to this consequential execution of strategy. We would want to carry this momentum into 2023 and beyond but looking at the right balance between cost and revenues. And the 70 costtoincome ratio is really what we are currently looking at as SR hypotheses.,DB,0.8591547608375549,0.7183093537744007,Positive
Okay. Well thats  so lets  so of course cost to income ratio theres cost theres revenues. Lets go back on to the revenue side. We talked about the strength of IB revenues. But of course this is the kind of the second big discussion on the revenue side is of course the trajectory of net interest income. And you have been quite vocal over the last quarters about a defense of the net interest income by of course loan growth particularly kind of domestically in Germany but also repricing again kind of corporate commercial deposits across Europe. Could you give us a sense of kind of where we are kind of any context you can give to that kind of broad NII trajectory,DB,0.9902485609054564,0.9804971101862847,Positive
Sure. It has remained a very central part of our strategy to counter the negative drag of interest rates with active measures that weve embraced in our businesses. Perhaps lets start with the Corporate Bank. The starting point for the Corporate Bank is already quite strong with 40 of the revenues there are fee income based already. So its a pretty solid starting point. But nonetheless we do have exposure to net interest income and the negative interest rate environment has clearly been a challenge.,DB,0.999688982963562,0.9993779655563626,Positive
In that sense Stefan Hoops and his team have done a formidable job at actually continuing to work on the conversion and the establishment of charged arrangement. And currently we have about 78 billion of our accounts which actually have a charging agreement attached to them which has helped us really increase and enhance revenues relative to where we were at the end of 2019 by about 200 million a year in that business.,DB,0.9717386960983276,0.9434773585065357,Positive
And with momentum that again we expect to carry into 2021 as more of that activity care  is carried out. In the private bank focus has been on rounding out the business and it has been done quite successfully. We have increased volumes in 2020 of loans by about 13 billion of net inflows were approximately 18 billion in 2020 of which 5 billion were actually deposit conversions. So we have achieved a good reduction of deposits enhancement of invested assets which obviously is good for the bank is good for our clients.,DB,0.1078125238418579,-0.7843760158872699,Negative
And if you take into account the fact that we have continued on repricing activities on all of our products we have for example continue to create these new accounts over 100000 are applied on a charge basis. This has generated approximately 100 million of incremental revenues for the Private Bank in 2020 and we expect that same level of incremental revenue to continue into 2021 as these measures continue to be applied.,DB,0.8259027004241943,0.651805193308111,Positive
And so when you look at the growth rates expected in these businesses its actually looking like we are holding for example in the Private Bank in Germany quite steady. But in the interest rate environment we have in Europe steady is actually a strong performance as shown in the performance of our retail bank in 2020 relative to peers. That was actually quite resilient thanks to all these measures that have been put in place.,DB,0.9997450113296508,0.9994900223553311,Positive
Brilliant. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Now lets move on to kind of onto the CRU kind of rundown path because youve mentioned the stranded costs and of course they have been revised. They have been revised down. But also the prime finance transfer to BNP. Is it on track When is this transaction finishing,DB,0.9937458038330078,0.9874916002104284,Positive
So we are very pleased with the progress were making on the CRU. We have halved the RWA exposure since inception we have reduced the leverage exposure by three quarters since inception costs have been halved to 1.8 billion or so. And we actually see really good progress towards those targets we have laid out for 2022. And in fact even improved for example on the cost side numbers further by virtue of us focusing quite systematically on the continued extraction of a number of charges.,DB,0.112537682056427,-0.7749256938253009,Negative
Now the performance of the CRU is predicated on a lot of activities from derisking to a successful execution of the sale of our Prime Finance business to BNP that transaction is fully on track. In fact were really quite pleased of how its playing out. I think its a positive transaction for us for BNP and for our clients. Its actually playing out in the way we had envisaged. And we have continued to offer to our clients those services obviously now after the transaction has closed quite successfully.,DB,0.9767297506332396,0.9534594735261639,Positive
As it relates to the outlook for the CRU we do expect the targets for 2022 of a reduction of RWAs down to approximately 32 billion to stay on track. We have been quite transparent on the composition of those 32 billion. The vast majority will be operational riskweighted assets which well pay down over time approximately 9 million related to credit and market risk. And those are going to have a stickier profile. And so while we do not see a particularly adverse risk profile from those we expect that it will take some time to unwind. Its things like structured repos with sovereigns which obviously are safe positions that will nonetheless take a longer period of time to unwind. And so in that sense we feel that the trajectory of the CRU the liberation of capital strategy has worked well will continue to serve us very well until 2022 and we remain on track on all fronts.,DB,0.8538992404937744,0.7077983068217675,Positive
Perfect. I think maybe one of the kind of last things. Weve  we havent touched upon of course the credit cycle and your outlook on provisions into 2021,DB,0.9890642166137696,0.9781284201910618,Positive
I can say a few words on that. We were quite pleased with how 2020 played out. In fact I remember Magdalena you asked me the question just last year when we were actually still physically on stage at Park Lane Hills at Hilton in Central London. And you asked me about how do we see loan losses At the time I think we had just started to give guidance of the 25 to 45 basis points for 2020. And we were pleased to actually land in a 41 basis points number for the year which was within that guidance.,DB,0.177100658416748,-0.6457996641395476,Negative
And I have to say this was down to a strong risk management framework that Deutsche Bank had embraced and strong discipline in the portfolio. We went into the crisis with and then continued to work with strong discipline to continue to derisk as the year unfolded. If I look at 2021 that strength has continued to show. So for example for Q1 we expect our credit loss provisions to come in at properly around half of the current consensus of 360 million. And we expect overall for 2021 that the overall CLP profile to be materially lower than we had for 2020. And then we expect for 2022 onwards to see a more normalized CLP environment of around 25 to 30 basis points. But for 2021 like I said for Q1 our current outlook is about half of current consensus for DB.,DB,0.2198019921779632,-0.5603969457131301,Negative
Very very encouraging to hear the numbers. All right. Superb. And then  and before we move to questions Fabrizio lets talk about something slightly different. You have been the best performing banking stock in SX7P in 2020. And so how do you continue to build that kind of shareholder value into this year,DB,0.9999643564224244,0.9999287128023584,Positive
Yes. It was a very positive run for Deutsche Bank in 2020. We believe the best thing we can do is to continue to execute on the plan we have laid out. We are very focused on that 8 return on tangible equity in 2022. And were doing this by everything we discussed today. On revenue continuing growth to the level at which we are expecting it. That level by the way if you look at 2020 would imply a 0.4 compounded annual growth rate for 2021 and 2022 which seems to be at reach given the momentum were seeing in fact already in the first few weeks in the year.,DB,0.892444908618927,0.7848896890221173,Positive
And on cost we spoke about it. There is a lot of discipline and a lot of focus on achieving those goals in a very systematic and very disciplined manner. And frankly when we look at revenues being closed and had reached 12 consecutive quarters of cost reductions which we intend to carry forward into the year a robust credit position and framework that is making us comfortable around the plan notwithstanding maintaining a lot of mitigants and maintaining overlays which we had in the second half of last year and carried into 2021 to mitigate for risk.,DB,0.9992407560348512,0.9984815111646126,Positive
We see that that 8 return on tangible equity and the fact that we will be working our way to reach it quite consistently and with the momentum were seeing right now inside the bank around the bank is giving us confidence that the Deutsche Bank share price will continue to rise. At 8 return on tangible equity we would be talking about a 0.8x tangible book or call it 18 to 19 per share if you assume that the price to  the tangible book per share value remains the same.,DB,0.9998984336853028,0.9997968672495292,Positive
And so obviously we are very focused on not disappointing on our target. This is a management team that has really in the last 18 months delivered against everything it promises and the intention will be to maintain that focus. If on top of that you add the fact that we did speak about going back to capital returns from 2022 onwards and we have spoken about the 5 billion capital return strategy that would come on top. And of course we would hope that all of this would be enough to continue to build that momentum on Deutsche Bank.,DB,0.9999601244926452,0.999920248937755,Positive
Perfect. Thanks very much. And lets take a couple of questions from the audience. Lets  the first one is about capital markets performance kind of yeartodate and your view of the phenomenon of SPACs. I suppose you wouldnt have avoided this one.,DB,0.9999837875366212,0.9999675750539156,Positive
Yes. SPACs are performing really well. Its a predominantly in the U.S. Theyre benefiting I think all banks and theyre benefiting DB as well. We are seeing a great momentum in that part of the business ourselves. And it is a kind of product were looking at because we obviously want to build on longterm momentum. And of course these are the kind of products that tend to live more on cycles rather than longterm outlooks.,DB,0.997809648513794,0.9956192944164839,Positive
And so we are looking at quite closely at how we can continue to support clients on the product but we continue to also focus on having a longterm capital strategy  market strategy that builds on all legs of capital markets. And in that sense as I outlined earlier we were actually quite pleased with the fact that our overall performance in capital markets was well balanced across all products and asset classes within it. And it was not just one product.,DB,0.9999911785125732,0.9999823570146305,Positive
And one more question on IB. And I  and its a little bit kind of one sided. So kind of  so bear with me. Youre the second bank this  at this conference which gave actually the kind of the yeartodate Investment Banking revenue growth number. So of course you talked about 20 and Credit Suisse yesterday talked about 50. So the question is is that  do you feel of course its literally  its a comparison oneonone. But do you feel that youre actually kind of losing market share if some of your peers are showing that type of momentum,DB,0.9212591648101808,0.8425182357539154,Positive
We are actually looking at our market shares quite closely. And we have looked at our market share and the momentum on market share we had in the second half of 2020 was actually quite positive as the idiosyncrasies that particularly benefits U.S. banks normalize in the second half of that year DB benefited quite a bit. I think we gained across Investment Banking over  almost 0.5 percentage points of market share. And we see that momentum having continued actually in 2021. Its also worth saying that the number I quoted earlier didnt have any particular oneoff effect in it. So its a fairly consistent comparison yearonyear.,DB,0.9992027282714844,0.9984054555925461,Positive
Okay. Is there any  when you think about the kind of the IB side and of course you have a stated objective of growing share within the IB overall which  I suppose which bits are you hoping to kind of gain share the most,DB,0.8116879463195801,0.6233756681535649,Positive
So we  our strategy was to refocus our franchise. And therefore when you think about how our Investment Bank has developed it was in the context of the broader strategy in which we want our core bank and all of its  and partly to be focused on areas in which we can compete to win. What we are seeing  and 2020 was a good display of that and 2021 is actually very positive in confirming that is that that strategy of refocusing our franchise away from equities and much more into the origination advisory capital markets pieces and within FIC on our financing trading and the macro businesses is actually paying out because those are businesses in which DB has gained market share has strengthened its position in ways that actually play right in the hand of the rest of the bank and in the rest of the franchise where we can truly become more clientcentric and operate in businesses in Investment Bank in which we can continue to support our for example corporate client base into 2021 and beyond.,DB,0.999623477458954,0.9992469544690579,Positive
So the areas in which were seeing momentum are exactly the areas in which we have invested since 2019. And those are the areas of Investment Bank that have been quite systematically performing since  particularly strongly since the beginning of 2020.,DB,0.0472045540809631,-0.9055920276594327,Negative
Perfect. Now theres a couple of kind of NII questions. And I suppose the one which is most  which is kind of asked pretty much to every single bank is how should we think about the steepening of the curve for you in terms of how does it translate broadly into your NII,DB,0.9982835054397584,0.9965670088332947,Positive
Well. We do have  we expect looking into our models that the vast majority of the adverse effect of the drag to revenues caused by the current curve environment will be digested by 2022. And so for us the effort continues to be that of defending our NII through the strategies I outlined earlier on deposit charging on repricing on systematic conversion of deposits into investments focusing on inflows.,DB,0.7945958971977234,0.5891915495345292,Positive
All of these measures are going to contribute to maintaining as resilient and steady revenue outlook in our core bank until we see more of that momentum kicking in later in 2020 hopefully 2021 and into 2022 where we believe that thanks to all this effort combined obviously with the heavy lifting that is happening behind the scenes on costs staying very disciplined on credit risk it will help us to really turn those businesses into strong profitability momentum businesses into 2022 and beyond.,DB,0.2132061123847961,-0.5735887131623705,Negative
Perfect. And a couple of clarification kind of questions coming through. Fabrizio youve talked about the potential for a higher SRF fee Can you just repeat that You thought it could be 600 million And that does not  and that does not impact your cost target. I mean that was the question. Whether the change in that charge impact your target at all,DB,0.9868286848068236,0.9736573539122066,Positive
Sure. I did mention that. So you remember that at the end of last year James described our expectation on the SRF bank levy to be approximately 300 million for 2021. And that was predicated on the assumption of a fund being capped  the overall Single Resolution Fund being capped at approximately 55 billion. With the latest guidance of  from the Single Resolution Board that the fund may be expanded to over 70 billion we are obviously adjusting our obviously adjusting our charges accordingly which we therefore believe will be just under 600 million for 2021.,DB,0.7948881387710571,0.589776033029576,Positive
We obviously do not expect that this is already a decision for 2022 as well and well continue to advocate that given that expansion of the base for the calculation of the levy is also driven by an expansion of deposits across European banks driven by the very strong peculiarities of 2020 and the pandemic that that should be resolved or should be addressed in future calculation that will remain our focus.,DB,0.9984070062637328,0.996814010628468,Positive
But either way we remain committed to the 16.7 billion target. And of course we will do everything to  even in 2021 to counter the effects of that and  of that incremental charge relative to our original plan by basically targeting the same level of profitability we had before.,DB,0.1720898151397705,-0.6558213566668967,Negative
Okay. Perfect. So thank you very much for that clarification. Now theres also a quick question again press topical from the perspective of any impact from Greensill Insolvency.,DB,0.9996795654296876,0.9993591304773872,Positive
Thank you. We do not have as a bank any direct exposure to Greensill or the GFG Alliance. We obviously are a German bank and are large contributor to the German deposit insurance schemes and so there will likely be an impact from that perspective. But those schemes are fully funded and so there is no expectation of any imminent impact deriving from those events. Of course over time there may be the need to replete  to refund those funds certainly on the statutory the voluntary side theres to be decided. So its still unclear and  when and how much this would result into. But we dont see this as being an imminent situation on DB.,DB,0.0303025543689727,-0.9393960472321794,Negative
And the last question is really quite longer term. It kind of asks weve got  were in a period of a very good investment banking performance. Weve talked about it a lot. Of course 2022 and its expectations for kind of 2021. As you look at your kind of revenue diversification going forward so kind of medium term do you think that there is a situation where the other parts of the group are likely to increase their revenue mix So a lot of moving parts but kind of  but longer term how do you see the revenue mix,DB,0.0979617238044738,-0.8040776277051138,Negative
Well our strategy has not changed to what we had announced in 2019. In fact what is happening right now its clearly been more beneficial to the Investment Bank and the environment particularly the adverse interest rates have really made it harder for the rest of our core bank businesses to perform to the level that is their potential. But based on everything were doing and the things I was describing to you earlier actually there is a lot of untapped momentum untapped potential in those businesses which in a normalized interest rates environment as we really think about that reflation wave that may come across will really benefit precisely those businesses that we see as the remaining part of our core strategy.,DB,0.9882906675338744,0.9765813211091285,Positive
So as you look into 2022 2023 and beyond the strategy we laid out to want to compete to win on four businesses obviously the Investment Bank but also the Corporate Bank a wellrounded Private Bank which sits on our pillar in Germany and a pillar internationally and our Asset Management franchise with BWS we believe that all of them will actually behave quite strongly.,DB,0.9984787106513976,0.9969574194892759,Positive
The best thing were doing right now is to ensure that relative to competition those businesses perform well. And already in 2020 in a year in which everybody in our continent in particular suffered quite markedly from the macroeconomic environment around us our franchises in Corporate Bank and in the Retail Bank actually performed quite strongly. So we expect all of that to then pay off all the effort and the confidence that we have as a management team our people our clients to help us navigate exactly the strategy we laid out. So that we can make Deutsche Bank sustainably profitable in the long term.,DB,0.999795138835907,0.9995902774276002,Positive
Well perfect. I couldnt have kind of finished our session on a better summary. So Fabrizio thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Its always a very insightful conversation. And of course thank you to everybody thats joined us on the web.,DB,0.999996304512024,0.9999926090196427,Positive

Thank you Christian. Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Altas fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. On the call with us today are Ryan Greenawalt our Chairman and CEO and Tony Colucci our Chief Financial Officer. For todays call management will first provide a review of the fourth quarter and the full year financial results. And then we will conduct a QA session. We will begin with some prepared remarks before we open the call for your question.,ALTG,1.0,1.0,Positive

Thank you Sinem and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining Alta Equipment Groups fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Our strong performance and solid financial results in the fourth quarter capped off a transformative and very successful 2020 despite the significant impact of the COVID pandemic. We achieved several important accomplishments which Ill briefly touch on before turning the call over to Tony for a financial review of the fourth quarter and full year.,ALTG,0.9972514510154724,0.9945028987544171,Positive
The operating environment for our services continued to improve from the prior quarter as customer demand increased consecutively each month in the fourth quarter. Labor productivity which is the heartbeat of our operations increased to benchmark levels before the end of the year. In response to increased sales activity and demand for labor hours we added to our product support workforce both organically and through acquisitions and ended the year with over 900 skilled technicians an increase of approximately 250 technicians yearoveryear and representing roughly half of our total headcount. Our entire Alta team once again rose to the occasion during these difficult times demonstrating incredible dedication and delivered on our commitment to exceptional service and equipment uptime. A sincere thank you to all of our employees who make Alta the great company it is today.,ALTG,0.9783216714859008,0.9566433171292048,Positive
And touching on our financial highlights fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA came in at 24.6 million on revenue of 280.4 million. We reached a true milestone in delivering over 1 billion in revenue on a pro forma basis with adjusted pro forma EBITDA of 98.7 million for the year. Our liquidity position remains strong and our balance sheet flexible in providing the support needed to execute our organic and acquisition growth strategy. And looking at the full year we overcame many challenges that we faced due to the COVID pandemic and navigated the business through unprecedented shutdowns. We were designated as an essential business and remain fully operational at all of our 54 branches across 11 states. Our variable cost structure and the dexterity of our business model allows management to swiftly implement cost reduction measures to efficiently manage the business and sustain positive adjusted EBITDA and mitigate against margin declines. The revenue decline was less than anticipated and business activity began to pick up from the April trough through the end of the year.,ALTG,0.9417956471443176,0.8835912249035984,Positive
As we move through the recovery in the second half of the year we reduced some of the cost mitigation measures and began calling back skilled technicians who were furloughed as big business activity returned to preCOVID levels. The diversity of both our geographies and our endmarkets enabled us to weather the pandemic storm. Also as a reflection of our business model our product support revenue remained strong during this period and grew 47 in 2020 compared to the prior year when including our required revenues. In 2020 consistent with our acquisition strategy we expanded our geographic footprint established relationships with new OEM partners and further diversified our endmarket reach. In the fourth quarter we completed two accretive acquisitions that increased our scale and strengthened our business profile. We acquired the construction dealership assets of Vantage Equipment which operates three branches in the northern region of New York State. Alta is now the authorized distributor of Volvo products in most of New York State a region that offers significant additional expansion opportunities. Vantage also diversifies our customer base and serves as a great complement to our Lifttech business which serves the New York material handling market. This combination is powerful and allows us to bring our full resources to this large and growing market.,ALTG,0.9997189044952391,0.9994378086553861,Positive
As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call we closed the Howell Tractor and Equipment acquisitions in late October. Howell serves the Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana construction markets with a wide range of construction and crane equipment. Howell enjoys a strong relationship with leading manufacturers such as Sennebogen which is a new addition to Altas product line in the region.,ALTG,0.9777984619140624,0.9555968973618132,Positive
Looking at the full year we completed seven acquisitions which in total contributed approximately 23 million to adjusted EBITDA in 2020 our most active year on the MA front. Alta has become the partner of choice in the fragmented equipment dealer market as we provide manufacturers the benefit of our scale liquidity and reputation to facilitate share growth and customer loyalty. The structural supply demand and balance between buyers and sellers in our industry remains intact and we continue to execute on our growth strategy.,ALTG,0.9290966987609864,0.8581933129986008,Positive
As we noted in todays news release weve rebranded our Industrial Segments and Material Handling. Material Handling is the recognized industry vernacular and better describes the range of our capabilities. The rebranding will have particular significance of messaging to the ecommerce sector which values the integration of Material Handling equipment with the more sophisticated systems offerings. PeakLogix a national material handling systems integrator we acquired in midyear has significantly enhanced our positioning in this area and provides us with a competitive advantage in the fast growing warehousing and logistics market which has only continued to pick up steam as the recovery continuous. Peak offers a complete material management solution and delivers efficiency and increased productivity for its customers. Weve been able to crosssell and promote their services across our entire material handling customer base and integrate them with our other warehouse automation solutions.,ALTG,0.9931689500808716,0.9863378920184922,Positive
We also expanded our full service capabilities in this area more recently with a small but strategic acquisition in ScottTech which provides warehouse control software and systems. It is important to highlight that these new systems integration services are unconstrained by our dealership territories and both acquired businesses have customers throughout the U.S. and internationally.,ALTG,0.8035273551940918,0.6070544761743999,Positive
And looking forward we see a clear path to a full recovery as the recovery takes hold and the year progresses. The investments weve made in technology products and people position us well to continue our strong performance entering 2021. Were encouraged by the positive trends were seeing especially by the strong secular tailwinds that are apparent in our material handling and construction segments. Ecommerce growth is driving higher volumes from large retailers who warehouse their products which increases our opportunity to expand and lean into this area of the business. The demand for automation and more complex systems and technology in warehousing and material handling has never been greater and we believe it is in the early stages. There is clearly upside from potential federal stimulus and pentup demand for capital projects to improve our net  our aging national infrastructure. Altas strong relationships with leading OEMs and our recent geographic market expansion position us to be a great partner for both material handling and construction equipment markets.,ALTG,0.9999685287475586,0.9999370574576005,Positive
This was truly a transformative year by any measure we believe our strong financial results in our first year as a public company demonstrate the outstanding execution of our resilient dealership model and our operational discipline through a difficult and unprecedented time. We are exciting  excited and increasingly confident in our ability to deliver increased financial results and enhanced shareholder value moving forward. Id like to thank our manufacturing partners for their support our dedicated employees for their hard work and our shareholders for their support and confidence in the company.,ALTG,0.9999669790267944,0.9999339580142248,Positive
With that Ill now turn it over to Tony for his financial review.,ALTG,0.2348474860191345,-0.5303059400951506,Negative
Thank you Ryan and good evening everyone. Thank you for your interest in Alta Equipment Group and our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results.,ALTG,0.9987384676933287,0.9974769338827929,Positive
Before I start I first want to congratulate all of my Alta colleagues and all of Altas shareholders on our one year anniversary as a public company. The past year has been equal parts challenging and exciting. Navigating a global pandemic certainly wasnt part of our plan as we entered the public markets 13 months ago but our business and most importantly Altas employees rose to COVIDs challenge and delivered a performance that Ryan and I are extremely grateful for and proud of. Additionally I want to welcome our new team members at Vantage Equipment and ScottTech in upstate New York to the Alta family. The senior leadership team is excited about integrating your talents into our business and into Altas one team culture. We look forward to earning your trust.,ALTG,0.9999704360961914,0.9999408721571399,Positive
My remarks today will focus on four key areas first Ill be presenting our fourth quarter performance which we are pleased with. As the business continues to close in the COVID gap and gain ground yearoveryear on some key metrics. Ill be focusing in on specific departmental revenue figures organic cash flows and rental fleet fluctuations and outperformance on these metrics impacted the balance sheet and our leverage profile in a positive way. Second Ill be discussing our full year 2020 performance and sequential quarteroverquarter trends in two of our key performance indicators. Specifically Ill discuss how those KPI trends correlated to EBITDA performance for the year and how those 2020 trends compared to 2019 a year reflective of a more typical business climate. Third I want to touch on yearend acquisition of Vantage Equipment how we thought about the return profile of our investment when compared to the cost of capital associated with the preferred stock we raised to fund the transaction. I also want to provide some high level financial figures on the ScottTech acquisition that we closed at the beginning of this month. Lastly Ill discuss the balance sheet and in particular our leverage and liquidity position as we entered 2021.,ALTG,0.0045201182365417,-0.9909609502321186,Negative
Real quickly it should be noted that there are some slides in our presentation which was released prior to our call today that presents our fourth quarter and full year numbers in greater detail than what I will discuss today. Id encourage everyone on todays call to review our presentation and our 10K which is available on our Investor Relations website at altaequipment.com.,ALTG,0.9983181357383728,0.9966362694718061,Positive
With the first portion of my prepared remarks fourth quarter performance. First lets talk about the profit and loss statement. For the quarter the company recorded revenue of 280 million which is a record sales number for Alta. Ill get into what drove that figure to such a high level in a moment but the 280 million represents a 60 million sequential increase over Q3 and a 9.4 increase on an organic basis versus Q4 2019. From an EBITDA perspective we realized 24.6 million in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter up from 21.9 million in the third quarter of 2020. Importantly our adjusted pro forma EBITDA for Q4 which assumes we had owned Vantage and Howell for the entire quarter was 26.2 million or 2.7 million less than Q4 of 2019. Ill come back to that 2.7 million EBITDA variance a little later in my comments.,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Next Id like to talk about organic cash flows in the fourth quarter. First I mentioned the 280 million in revenue a moment ago and how that was a record sales number for the business. Just to focus in on that briefly on previous calls I mentioned how the fourth quarter is typically the largest equipment sales quarter of the year for Alta and in particular its historically been our largest rental equipment sales quarter of the year. Really in a bit further new and used equipment sales were 135 million for the quarter a 37 million increase over Q3 another record number. But importantly we recorded an additional 38 million of rental equipment sales for the quarter a number that is two times the amount sold in Q3 2020.,ALTG,0.9782719612121582,0.9565438965224602,Positive
The reason why I focused on the 38 million rental disposal number is because it led to a net decrease of 10.5 million in rental fleet which when coupled with our EBITDA for the quarter led to an organic delivering of approximately 15 million and an unlevered free cash flow conversion on EBITDA factor of over 100 for Q4 2020. We believe this organic delevering to be a powerful indication on the marketability of our rental fleet assets and our ability to generate cash flow and liquidity by optimizing our rental fleet in a short period of time. On an organic basis we believe this to be the story of the quarter.,ALTG,0.9779544472694396,0.9559088682585166,Positive
Few other PL highlights before I move on. And just to jump back to the equipment sales number in Q4 just for a second lets keep in mind our razor and blade business model. The 103 million in equipment sales for the quarter is now customer field population which bodes well for the future of our high margin product support departments. Another encouraging metric from the PL we saw a 2.5 million rental revenue increase over Q3 2020 on an organic basis an indication of continued strengthening in our rental business. And importantly continued yearoveryear organic growth in our parts and service departments in our construction segment.,ALTG,0.9944285154342652,0.9888570242267993,Positive
Moving on to the second key area of my prepared remarks. Id like to focus on some high level pro forma numbers for the full year 2020 and certain quarteroverquarter trends in key performance indicators we observed throughout the year. First for the fiscal year 2020 as Ryan mentioned on a pro forma basis our annual revenue is now slightly above the 1 billion mark. And on an adjusted pro forma basis our EBITDA as of the year  as of yearend was nearly 100 million. A few key points and trends to point out is we do a look back on 2020 and Id like to refer everyone to Slide 19 of our earnings presentation which depicts the data Ill be referring to.,ALTG,0.9999600648880004,0.9999201297283944,Positive
First as weve discussed on previous calls two major drivers of EBITDA cash flows in our business correlate to two key performance indicators we track labor productivity and rental fleet utilization. Of note and discussed on prior calls we saw the bottom in labor productivity in Q2 2020 began to recover on the metric in Q3 and Im happy to report that we were able to achieve preCOVID labor productivity levels in Q4 that trend has continued as we moved into Q1. So for labor productivity a Vshaped recovery to be sure and with positive trends headed into 2021.,ALTG,0.2152348458766937,-0.5695312437601351,Negative
Second rental utilization which I  which as I have mentioned previously has lagged historic levels realized in our business. And as you will note on slide 19 our physical utilization variants versus the prior years followed a similar trend that labor productivity followed in 2020. We began to see the followup towards the end of Q1 the yearonyear variance was most acute in Q2 we started recovering in Q3 and continued to close the gap in Q4. Now unlike labor productivity as of the end of the year we have yet to fully close the gap on rental utilization. Having said that and importantly the early signs in Q1 are encouraging and suggest a continued closing of the gap.,ALTG,0.9776962399482728,0.955392453308376,Positive
So in summary as we looked at these two key KPIs and how they trended throughout 2020 and we correlate them against our EBITDA performance throughout the year we noticed similar trend in terms of the gap versus historic norms. Again referring to slide 19 you will note that our yearonyear EBITDA performance mimics the trends observed in the two KPIs. In summary of the 13.7 million in EBITDA variance for the year approximately 75 was incurred in Q2 and Q3. Importantly as with both the KPIs we continue to narrow the yearonyear EBITDA gap here in Q4 with the gap being 2.7 million on a pro forma basis for the quarter versus a 6.7 million gap in Q3 2020.,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Last item of note in this section of my commentary the turbulence of 2020 disguised a typical seasonality in our business and in particular the seasonality of our EBITDA. In the EBITDA lookback chart on slide 19 you will note that almost 25 of our pro forma 2020 EBITDA more typically and expectedly given our construction Technical Difficulty annual EBITDA Q2 and Q4 delivered 20 and 25 each and Technical Difficulty the macro backdrop Technical Difficulty.,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the third area of my prepared remarks Id like to briefly touch on our recent MA activity in the preferred stock offering we contemplated Technical Difficulty. For the year we completed our acquisition of Vantage at an additional 40 million of revenue. The acquisition further expands our territorial reach with Volvo and provides for natural synergies with Lifttech our material handling operation in upstate New York. At a total enterprise value of about 23 million we believe the deal to be accretive from an EBITDA multiple standpoint as well as in comparison to the cost of capital we sourced to fund the transaction which was the preferred stock offering we completed in concert with the acquisition.,ALTG,0.9960594177246094,0.9921188307516757,Positive
With approximately 30 technicians serving a market territory known to be greater in size in our established Michigan territory where we staff more than 100 technicians we see  we see a tremendous aftermarket opportunity and expect to double the size of that business overtime thereby furthering the accretion over the cost of capital used to fund the deal.,ALTG,0.9913148283958436,0.9826296464381497,Positive
Onto ScottTech on March 1 we completed the acquisition of ScottTech Integrated Solution as a complement to our PeakLogix acquisition completed in the middle of 2020. Specializing a warehouse management software and systems integration we believe the combination of PeakLogix and ScottTech further expands our full solution product offerings and increases our commitment to the emerging technology space. At a purchase price of approximately 2.5 million the acquisition adds approximately 10 million of revenue in close to a 1 million of annual EBITDA to the enterprise.,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the last part of my prepared remarks I want to give a quick update on the balance sheet and our credit profile at the end of Q4. Two key factors here to discuss leverage and liquidity. First leverage. I mentioned early in the call we realized an organic deleveraging in the business by virtue of our big quarter in rental equipment sales. That factor alongside solid EBITDA performance in the quarter and the use of the preferred stock offering to fund advantage acquisition all led to total leverage reducing from about 3.6x EBITDA in Q3 to 3.4x at year end which with senior leverage dropping to 1.8x with both leverage ratios being well inside our leverage covenants.,ALTG,0.9861934185028076,0.9723868205468778,Positive
Touching on liquidity. And we feel really good about our position here. Recall that we closed the IPO with roughly 150 million in cash and revolving liquidity. Since the IPO in midFebruary weve acquired five and now at six strategic business funding growth CapEx in our rental fleets specifically in an emerging market like Florida in service the cash cost of our debt. As of the end of Q4 Im happy to report the business held the same level of liquidity that it had at the IPO or approximately 150 million. We believe holding liquidity at these levels given all the challenges and activity that 2020 presented to be an impressive result a reflection of our cash flow profile and a strong collateral base which we use to fund important strategic investments. This is also a testament to how we thoughtfully positioned our capital structure and how we fund MA.,ALTG,0.9986371994018556,0.9972743971791254,Positive
In closing I want to thank all of my teammates at Alta for your commitment to the business and to each other throughout 2020. To our investors we appreciate the opportunity to be stewards of your capital and appreciate your support as we navigated our first year as a public company. I have great faith in our proven business model our leadership team and our vision for the future and look forward to a successful 2021.,ALTG,0.9999939203262328,0.9999878406452181,Positive

QuestionandAnswer Session,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions The first question is from Alex Rygiel from B. Riley. Your line is open.,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Ryan and Tony. Very nice quarter and strong year. Congratulations.,ALTG,0.9999958276748656,0.9999916553447574,Positive
Thank you Al.,ALTG,0.9314355850219728,0.8628710883087449,Positive
Thanks Alex.,ALTG,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
A couple of quick questions. Your adjusted EBITDA margins today are around 10. Can you talk about some of the drivers to margin expansion in 2021 and beyond,ALTG,0.9477987289428712,0.895597395656941,Positive
Sure Alex. When we look back at the fourth quarter there Ive made special note in my comments about the large amount of rental equipment sales. And so for the quarter its going to feel like its going to look like that our EBITDA margins were depressed but it really was a function of all of the equipment sales and to refer back to the razor and the blades concept thats inherent in our business model. As you know razors dont have as good of margin as the blades and so that that mix got thrown out of whack there in the fourth quarter. As we drive forward here obviously the business model is to continue to grow feel the ph population build the product support business which is higher margin in the future. So we would think that the mix as we continue to move along wont be the same as it was in the fourth quarter and shift more kind of appropriately back toward a more regular mix of parts and service thereby kind of driving that EBITDA margin a little bit further north in the future. When we think about rental EBITDA margins on rental are very high as well. We had some positive news there and it continue to trend in the appropriate direction. So so long as rental continues to trend that will also drive the EBITDA margin higher.,ALTG,0.999998152256012,0.9999963045098212,Positive
And then could you maybe talk a little bit about which customer categories are rebounding the quickest postCOVID here And which ones are rebounding slower and maybe add some thoughts on whether or not those slower customer categories could catch up,ALTG,0.982216477394104,0.9644329335885844,Positive
Sure Alex. This is Ryan. So a couple areas that are rebounding faster at our home turf is the automotive industry in our home state of Michigan. And then throughout our material handling dealership footprint anything related to the warehousing market has remained steady and is accelerating. Also with supply constraints anything related to steel the scrap industry is hot right now. Thats a component of our business scrap demolition in the steel industry on the construction side.,ALTG,0.99884831905365,0.9976966367343885,Positive
And then lastly on MA. Can you talk a little bit about your MA pipeline both within sort of your core business lines as well as thoughts about adding a third leg,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure. We think about the first leg being territorial expansion with our two most significant OEM partners. And those opportunities were always watching for but there has to be a catalyst some kind of succession planning issue or a catalyst a reason for one of the ownership groups to be looking for an exit. What we have a lot of is infill opportunities which there were several examples of that last year. As we as we look to some of these markets where were less mature or the new entrants and taking over territories where we can grow share well be looking to build the product portfolio and there could certainly be an MA component of that talking in smaller dealerships in our existing footprint. And in terms of the third segment as we mentioned on the last call were very focused on kind of watching the evolution of transportation the electrification of the over the road fleet. Over the road the truck segment is something that wed like to be in long term. And as the business evolves we think that were really wellpositioned with our experience in both electric on the battery side and the fuel cell side from our material handling business. So those are conversations that were open to. Its sort of very active time. A lot of new companies coming to market and that we do envision something long term in that sector.,ALTG,0.9999504685401917,0.9999009370213372,Positive
Very helpful. Thank you.,ALTG,0.9971423149108888,0.9942846264151495,Positive
Your next question is from Michael Shlisky from Colliers Securities. Your line is open.,ALTG,0.9194797277450562,0.8389593595024105,Positive
Good afternoon guys. Can we can we just get back to the indiscernible I may have missed it. Can you repeat back with the organic growth was in the quarter And of the various revenue categories that you have in your release in your 10K which ones were the biggest drivers of that while the other things are going to be up for sure,ALTG,0.9923246502876282,0.9846492914255209,Positive
Mike Ill take the first half of that. I think your question was the organic growth for the quarter. I think the number was 9.4 as an enterprise. Yes 9.4. What was the second half of your question Mike,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I was just curious as to which categories of revenue drove the organic growth the most,ALTG,0.7513117790222168,0.5026232615847954,Positive
Oh yes by in large Mike it was the equipment sales as I mentioned. Rental equipment sales. As customers we get toward year end customers have capital budgets that maybe theyre looking to get rid of for the year if you will. We also have customers that have historically looked to take advantage of bonus depreciation from a tax perspective. And so the fourth quarter is usually overweight equipment sales and it was again this year probably more than we expected. But that equipment sales number is whats driving a lot of the organic growth. We did have organic growth as we mentioned in the rental line in parts and service and construction as well. Which all kind of bodes well when you kind of peel the layers back here.,ALTG,0.9992893934249878,0.9985787860028661,Positive
Got it. I also wanted to ask about your rental fleet here in 2021. Ill have little ph spent some time during the downturn kind of pairing assets making sure they had ph  it was the best performers and the best outlook. Did you allow that during Q2 to Q4 And of course you have a better performance ahead for the rental fleet from a margin perspective in 2021,ALTG,0.9850003719329834,0.9700007259850061,Positive
Yes Mike this is Tony. Ill take that one. So when we think about rental were thinking always about utilization and cash flows off of it. Not necessarily gross margin because theres so much depreciation in there. But as we move through Q2 and Q3 we had already kind of committed to making some investments down in Florida with the Flagler acquisition and adding rental fleet down there. We think long term that its still the right thing to do. And what we did here in the fourth quarter was kind of optimize a little bit. I mentioned the reduction of about 10 million in organic kind of acquisition costs here. As we left the year end as youll see in our numbers we got roughly a 400 million fleet headed into 2021. We feel good about that fleet level. It may ebb and flow. If we have a 400 million fleet youll see in our numbers we turned over almost a quarter of that fleet in the year which is part of our business model is that renttosell ph with the heavy equipment to get it out in the field population. So at any rate the fleet may ebb and flow a little bit but by in large the expectation here is that were going to keep the fleet kind of in that same level let the market kind of decide demand to see if were going to expand or if we have to pair back some more. But we dont at this point have expectation of growing the fleet in any material way.,ALTG,0.9933912754058838,0.9867825429335493,Positive
Great. And then one last one from me. The EBITDA that we saw in Q4 and the exit rate for the year is that a good sort of baseline minimum for the full year adding in perhaps maybe 9 million to 10 million for the last two deals a bit in the fourth quarter And from there do you have any sense as to what you might get from close ph perspective in 2021,ALTG,0.9997951984405518,0.9995903966369608,Positive
Yes. Good question Mike. The number that I would refer you to in the fourth quarter as kind of a good metric to maybe build off as we move along here is the 26.2 million of pro forma EBITDA for the fourth quarter. I made special mention of kind of the seasonality here as we as we go along and how that seasonality kind of gets flipped around a little bit in 2020. But I think that fourth quarter numbers are a good one to build off of. Relative to organic growth we have the coming off of 2020 we would we would expect some. Were impacted by COVID so we certainly think well be jumping off of 2020 levels. How much It kind of remains to be seen and Im not sure were prepared to give a number at this point.,ALTG,1.0,1.0,Positive

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions here. Just trying to get a gauge of how supply channels are looking right now. Have you had any issues I guess sourcing parts or equipment quick lease ph Or are you seeing some delays here,ALTG,0.8567342162132263,0.7134682616402279,Positive
Were definitely seeing delays in areas. So equipment lead times are starting to stretch in certain product categories the constraints on steel and other materials are definitely being felt. We always try to remind that we can withstand shortterm variability and things like that. We use our rental fleet to fill in for our customer needs and the flip side of that is we see firming up of pricing and utilization on both rental rates and time utilization but also on the used side things that are definitely appreciating today.,ALTG,0.9773120880126952,0.9546241489792755,Positive
Okay. Thanks Ryan. And then if we look at the technician edition are you able to break out the organic growth and the acquisition growth Just trying to get a gauge of the recruiting landscape out there.,ALTG,0.999940037727356,0.9998800753832313,Positive
This is Tony Brian. Thanks for joining. The one metric that I think we could  we dont have the number top of mind in terms of how many organic hires we add if you will throughout the year. And it gets a little foggy with given COVID and the furloughs and so on and so forth. The one metric that we are kind of pointing to is weve talked a lot about the aftermarket opportunity we saw down at Flagler in Florida. When we took that dealership over they had 63 technicians. I think we closed the year with 83 technicians on staff down there. So growing in all the right areas where theres a lot of opportunity. Now that same 50 increase or whatever the number is there  30 maybe  we would not have realized that in other areas. It would have been more muted than that. But the Florida kind of experience stands out.,ALTG,0.999651312828064,0.9993026252404602,Positive
That is helpful. Thats it for me. Thanks.,ALTG,0.9991625547409058,0.9983251084834983,Positive

Your next question is from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson.,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks. A couple questions. First you just mentioned that youre seeing pricing firming on the rental utilization in the used side of things. With that then when would you expect the rental utilization gap to be fully closed at this point Or maybe youre already seeing that in early 2021 So maybe talk about that a little bit,ALTG,0.9991289377212524,0.9982578744041171,Positive
Matt thanks for joining. This is Tony. Good question. As Ive mentioned in my prepared remarks in Q1 were off to a good start in terms of continued closing of the gap if you will. Will we get there in Q1 I think it still remains to be seen. I like to say by the end of Q1 we would see that utilization gap close. I think the comment that I would make is if we continue to see trends of what we see here in Q1 that utilization gap will get closed here hopefully by the middle of the year or in Q2 at some point. But were gaining on it every day.,ALTG,0.9998904466629028,0.9997808931952079,Positive
Then with respect to the actual utilization rate can you give us a sense as to where they are currently Maybe versus where they were just preCOVID And maybe where they trough during COVID Just to kind of frame that up a little better and more specifically,ALTG,0.7997562885284424,0.5995123383476366,Positive
Yes. I think the way that I would answer that Matt is if had 100 of rental fleet kind of on the hand acquisition costs in a more normal situation we might have 60 or 65 of that out on rent. The variance that we saw and the shocks that we saw was something like take 10 off of that figure. So the 60 becomes 54 if you will and then you can kind of extrapolate that into our business. You can kind of see what happens to EBITDA so on and so forth thereafter. But again rough math thats kind of what we saw. And it was in the pockets of the fleet. Our material handling fleet didnt see as big of a shock that our construction fleet did in Q2 and Q3. So the 10 figures that I gave you is kind of the mix and the most acute that we saw when you kind of fully mix the entire fleet together.,ALTG,0.0507548451423645,-0.8984914413043507,Negative
Got it. And then just two more quick ones. We can do the algebra later but just to save the time can you provide us what the organic revenue number was for material handling And then can you also comment from an MA perspective I would imagine the assets that are serving the material handling side of warehousing logistics ecommerce they were starting to see some multiple inflation there. So are those transactions  do you have anything sort of in the pipeline serving that market Or is that something that youre happy with the asset base to have in the organic opportunity in front of you that maybe youre not looking at organically now there Thank you.,ALTG,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
Im going to take the second part of that question while Tony does the math on the first part of the question. So for the kind of nonmobile equipment the warehouse solutions and the more systemsoriented businesses that we acquired last year and then earlier this year we are looking for opportunities. We would be opportunistic if we saw something but we think that we have the platform that we need. This is a business that we acquired intellectual property and now you could think of it as weve taken a group that had half a dozen salespeople on the stream today. They have over 100 material handling sales professionals out looking mining for opportunities. We think that theyll be very busy for the foreseeable future off of the platform we already have. But that said were always looking for interesting assets.,ALTG,0.9920779466629028,0.9841558838819766,Positive
Matt just to play off that  Im not sure weve seen an expansion in multiples or deal multiples because of the kind of the demand in the ecommerce space and the kind of activity in that space. We havent necessarily seen that play out. And Matt Im going to have to  actually hang on one second.,ALTG,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Good morning. Im pleased to be here for my first J.Jill Earnings call. I know that Im joining in an interesting time in the retail industry as we continue to face an uncertain macro environment with some lingering questions around when customers will feel more comfortable going out and shopping in stores. That said I truly believe in the great opportunity we have here at J.Jill. Its what brought me back to the brand after previously serving as Chief Marketing Officer almost 10 years ago. So while Im less than 1 month into my new role here I am well indiscernible in what makes J.Jill such a special brand and understand the incredible assets we have to leverage including our brand equity our strong omnichannel business model and our incredibly loyal customer base.,JILL,1.0,1.0,Positive
As we move forward well build on the work the team initiated in 2020 and continue to improve and strengthen our operating model driving efficiency and effectiveness while also providing our customers with exciting new product and the experience she deserves wherever and whenever she chooses to shop with us.,JILL,0.999835968017578,0.9996719358396144,Positive
As Mark will review the team has taken decisive action over the past year to position us to enter 2021 with enhanced financial stability a more nimble cost structure and cleaner inventory balances. While theres still much work to be done to continue to drive efficiencies within our operating model Im excited to work with our team to realize the potential of the J.Jill brand and business. I will now turn the call over to Mark to review our financial results. Mark,JILL,0.9801035523414612,0.9602070809644943,Positive
Thank you Claire. I look forward to our partnership as we position J.Jill for longterm profitable growth. Fiscal year 2020 was a challenging year and I would like to start today by expressing gratitude to the entire J.Jill team all of our employees in stores the distribution center and head offices for the resiliency and tenacity they demonstrated during a time of such great uncertainty. Not only were we focused on navigating the challenging COVID environment we also took actions to enhance the financial stability of the business operate more efficiently and position J.Jill for future growth.,JILL,0.9999560117721558,0.9999120234918735,Positive
In 2020 we strengthened the balance sheet by extending the maturity on almost 98 of term loan debt by 2 years to 2024 by amending debt covenants with lenders implementing a minimum liquidity covenant and obtaining a leverage covenant holiday through Q4 of 2021 amongst other changes and issuing a new subordinated term loan. We took initial steps to improve the operating model which we will continue to refine by focusing the product assortment and streamlining the number of product flows and adjusting the marketing mix and spend to maximize returns.,JILL,0.0592888593673706,-0.8814234026809947,Negative
And finally to best position ourselves for fiscal 2021 we took decisive actions including a comprehensive review of the store fleet in light of the uncleared time line to recovery of store traffic due to the COVID pandemic and made the decision to close 20 stores. And we executed on our commitment to aggressively manage inventories in fiscal 2020 to provide a clean start to 2021. Looking at the fourth quarter we continue to see signs of progress. Top line sales of 120 million improved sequentially compared to the third quarter and each month within the quarter improved sequentially as well. While store traffic continued to trend meaningfully below prior year in the fourth quarter with enclosed mall stores trailing lifestyle centers customers that did cross the threshold converted better and responded well to fullpriced product.,JILL,0.9997705221176147,0.9995410439616703,Positive
Direct sales were 65 of total driven in part by lower store sales but also by positive customer response to new full price collections online. Gross margin of 57.0 includes 590 basis points related to aggressive action taken in the quarter to liquidate liable markdown products through third parties. Excluding the impact of these liquidations gross margin was 62.9 up compared to last year driven by the strength in full price selling. We continue to focus on operating the business more efficiently. SGA expenses were down 15 million compared to last year driven by reductions in storerelated selling costs and lower marketing spend.,JILL,0.1639578938484192,-0.6720852089436107,Negative
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with inventories down 20 compared to last year. Total liquidity as defined in our covenant terms measured as ending cash balance plus check float and ABL availability was 37.3 million as of the end of the fourth quarter down compared to third quarter due to the normal cadence of cash usage this time of the year. Regarding tax the CARES Act passed in March of 2020 permits tax losses to be carried back to recover taxes paid in prior years. We are currently preparing the required filings to obtain refunds by carrying back our current year tax loss and expect to receive a tax refund in excess of 25 million. Consistent with our debt agreements we expect to apply these 25 million of this refund to pay down the priming term loan by August 30 2021.,JILL,9.059906005859377e-06,-0.9999830722707941,Negative
Looking at fiscal 2021 we continue to focus on strengthening the foundation of the business. With visibility still low given the ongoing pandemic we are not providing guidance at this time. We do however expect revenues to continue to recover in the first half as we anniversary temporary store closures related to the COVID19 shutdowns in 2020. We continue to focus on driving gross margin improvement supported by reduced inventory levels and better full price selling. Capital investment will increase to approximately 10 million driven by a return to normalized capital maintenance levels and select investments in customer experience enhancing initiatives. And though we believe the store channel is a very important channel for J.Jill we will continue to evaluate store performance postpandemic and expect to close about 20 stores in 2021.,JILL,0.8096455931663513,0.6192909594124314,Positive
In summary fiscal 2020 was a challenging year. And while macro uncertainties still exists we believe the actions we have taken set us up well for continued improvement in 2021 and profitable future growth. With that I will now turn the call back over to Claire.,JILL,0.995383620262146,0.9907672350211352,Positive
Thank you Mark and thank you all for joining us this morning. I also want to thank our teams for all of their hard work throughout this year and for their dedication to J. Jill.

They also worked diligently to clear the backlog caused by the recent severe winter weather in the U.S. a 50year event. They worked night and day to move the backlog quickly and as safely as possible. This includes the many team members who typically perform other duties and volunteered their time to help. Were sincerely grateful to them and to our customers for their understanding as we navigated the effects of these massive winter storms.,FDX,0.987201988697052,0.9744039621376765,Positive

Findings will be published and shared so that businesses industries and governments globally can benefit from this work.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Thank you Fred and good afternoon everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter of growth for FedEx. Despite challenging circumstances the team performed exceptionally well through the biggest peak season in our companys history. This included delivering nearly 0.5 billion holiday packages transporting the first shipment of COVID19 vaccines here in the US and increasing collaboration across operating companies.,FDX,0.9882879257202148,0.9765758374785409,Positive
Our results speak for themselves. In December we achieved the highest monthly totals in our companys history in both revenue and operating profit. Results in December were different than previous years. We better maximized our available capacity and as Brie will cover in a moment better aligned prices to incremental costs. Peak 2020 was unlike any peak experience before and sets a new standard for future peak seasons.,FDX,0.9764981269836426,0.9529962259508526,Positive
As Fred mentioned our operations were impacted by last months severe winter weather throughout the United States. Mike will expand more on the scope and unique nature of these storms.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And Im sure many of you have seen reports in the last couple of days which illustrate the impact these storms had on the overall US economy including retail sales and manufacturing output. We implemented numerous contingencies to mitigate the impact including adding sorts line haul and collaborating across our network to assist in the recovery. Im very proud of the team for managing through this very challenging situation.,FDX,0.0499032139778137,-0.9001947046486763,Negative
Now speaking of the team we announced that Henry Maier will retire this summer and named John Smith former President and CEO of FedEx Freight his successor. Lance Moll former SVP of Operations at FedEx Freight has been promoted to CEO and were pleased to have all these three gentlemen on the call today.,FDX,0.9301477670669556,0.8602954508635108,Positive
Now turning to FedEx Ground. The outstanding margin improvement for Ground in Q3 highlights the success of our ongoing strategic initiatives and investments to improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with the last mile even amid record residential volume levels. These investments continue to pay off. Let me share three examples.,FDX,0.9953009486198424,0.9906018916379757,Positive
Number one we saw a meaningful improvement in last mile efficiency as service providers improve their stops per hour 21 yearoveryear in Q3. Number two the average cost per stop decreased by 12 yearoveryear. And number three we maximized our assets expanding to sevenday operations and integrating Ground economy or formerly FedEx SmartPost reduced our fixed cost per package by 4 yearoveryear. We remain very optimistic for continued profitable growth at Ground.,FDX,0.8671473264694214,0.7342944945660201,Positive
Collaboration between operating companies continue at an unprecedented rate in Q3. This month marks the one year anniversary of the launch of last mile optimization which allows us to flex our networks to increase delivery density for residential rural and deferred packages.,FDX,0.2290734946727752,-0.5418539296710073,Negative
LMO will expand to six more markets effective May the 1st increasing to 63 markets in total and covering twothirds of the U.S. GDP. Additionally FedEx Freight has delivered more than 1.75 million shipments for Ground so far this fiscal year. This time last year Freight had yet to deliver a single Ground shipment as increased support for Ground kicked off in May of 2020.,FDX,0.039021223783493,-0.9219586980096687,Negative
Finally turning to FedEx Express. Our global network is moving COVID19 vaccines ingredients and supplies as we speak. It has been a coordinated orchestration of our physical and digital capabilities. At FedEx Express we expect elevated pricing for at least the next 12 months. We know however that these prices are not sustainable in the longer term and we will flex our networks appropriately as commercial capacity returns into the market.,FDX,0.9453949928283693,0.8907899205624585,Positive
In addition we will continue to improve our efficiency by executing last mile optimization and transforming our European business. In Europe momentum continues with the physical integration of the TNT network. We recently announced our Europe restructuring program and we are progressing with local consultations as planned and in accordance with local market regulations. April will be a big month as we prepare to roll out a set of new service capabilities for our customers which Brie will provide more detail very shortly here.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Well complete their integration in spring 2022 which will bring the physical network integration to a close. Our Paris Hub will be our main Express hub in Europe with Liege serving as Indi does in the U.S. thats our second largest European air hub. We remain focused on optimizing the network and strengthening our capabilities to drive upside in Europe for years to come.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In closing FedEx remains committed to delivering longterm profitable growth. We have the network the strategy and the right team in place as we build upon the exceptional results we have seen so far in fiscal year 2021.,FDX,0.9911643266677856,0.9823286428026217,Positive
With that let me turn it over to Brie.,FDX,0.8602713346481323,0.7205425027266161,Positive
Thank you Raj. Good afternoon everyone. In the United States we are seeing strong growth and momentum. The U.S. domestic parcel market is expected to grow to 101 million packages a day by calendar year 2022 with ecommerce contributing 86 of total U.S. market growth.,FDX,0.9996848106384276,0.99936962090112,Positive
Ecommerce as a percentage of U.S. retail sales was approximately 21 in Q4 of calendar 2020 significantly above the prepandemic level.,FDX,0.2460811734199524,-0.5078385519019079,Negative
We remain excited about the diversification and evolution of the ecommerce market. Some of our largest retail customers reported ecommerce growth rates in the high double and even tripledigits through 2020.,FDX,0.8248244524002075,0.6496486959747647,Positive
As the US reopens we recognize the potential for a shortterm deceleration in ecommerce shopping. However we are very confident that ecommerce as a percentage of retail has a long growth runway.,FDX,0.9702495336532592,0.9404990318411777,Positive
Turning now to peak. It certainly was the ship upon we predicted a peak upon a peak. We had tremendous growth with almost 500 million packages delivered and 19 yearoveryear ADV growth. To the global sales and marketing teams I could not be more proud of your execution and the momentum you have created.,FDX,0.99952232837677,0.9990446561841106,Positive
FY 2021 parcel volume growth remains strong supported by a portfolio of ecommerce solutions growing at doubledigits. Of particular note our FedEx Ground sevenday a week residential delivery service is one of the fastestgrowing services in ecommerce with 70 volume growth in Q3. Overall yeartodate average daily volume growth remains strong for all customer segments. However our US small and medium segment grew 35 through the end of February.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

In FY 2021 Q3 we increased FedEx Ground economy yield by 35 and overall US domestic residential yields by 15 yearoveryear. Its important to note FedEx Ground is formally FedEx SmartPost. While ecommerce is the key driver of the overall growth in January our US enterprise B2B volume was at preCOVID levels.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to our US revenue quality strategy. We continue to actively pursue yield management product and customer mix strategies. Our primary focus is ensuring large customer pricing aligns to their volume distribution. We continue to manage capacity at FedEx Ground prioritizing our highest yielding SAM segment as well as our premium home delivery product. As we plan for peak of fiscal year 2022 our peak surcharges will continue to play a critical role.,FDX,0.9945855140686036,0.9891710216826333,Positive
Turning now to international. Global air cargo capacity remains down 20 yearoveryear as of January. And we expect air cargo capacity to remain constrained through the end of calendar year 2021. We expect passenger capacity to recover between 55 and 75 of its preCOVID level by the end of calendar year 2021 with a full recovery not anticipated until 2023 or 2024.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
From a demand perspective APAC outbound has recovered to preCOVID while Europe outbound is expecting a partial recovery by the end of 2021 and a full recovery sometime in 2023. With these projections demand trends will continue to favor freighters and integrators. We are confident in our ability to maintain elevated yields for at least 12 months. With ecommerce driving significant growth internationally we will increasingly utilize peak surcharges in our international business.,FDX,0.8867290019989014,0.7734578689681704,Positive
Finally we are executing commercial strategies to maintain and grow our incremental volume as capacity recovers. Intercontinental performance continues to be very strong. Our total international express yield per pound has again seen impressive doubledigit yearoveryear improvements in all key markets. Our B2B volumes are recovering to preCOVID levels in Europe and are fully recovered in Asia while our overall growth is fueled by significant B2C volumes.,FDX,0.9976904392242432,0.9953808756952738,Positive
During our fourth quarter we will dramatically enhance our European portfolio. As stated on previous calls with the completion of the road integration last May our European road value proposition already gained significant improvements. Our customers have been accessing the unparalleled TNT European road network.,FDX,0.0351320803165435,-0.9297369895797907,Negative

We will be rolling out these new service capabilities to our customers over the coming months.,FDX,0.9858992099761964,0.9717984031429312,Positive
We will also launch FedEx International Connect Plus from Europe to the United States to Asia and within Europe providing the service across more than 200 lanes. FedEx International Connect Plus or FICP has been designed with features of service targeted to reduce the cost to serve while delivering an outstanding customer experience and is specifically targeted to support our ecommerce customers.,FDX,0.998633861541748,0.9972677214549313,Positive
The new European transportation portfolio is brought to market through a refreshed and modern online shipping application that has already rolled out in Europe and across 143 countries globally. In summary we have great momentum coming out of Q3.,FDX,0.8993299007415771,0.7986596814749727,Positive
And with that Ill turn it over to Mike for his comments.,FDX,0.8964908123016357,0.7929815012106307,Positive

FedEx delivered significantly improved financial results during the quarter as we met the challenges of rising demand and limited capacity during our peak season and overcame severe winter weather in February.,FDX,0.9555123448371888,0.9110246366409285,Positive
Adjusted operating profit increased 120 and adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points primarily due to strong volume growth in U.S. domestic residential package a 41 increase in FedEx international priority package volume led by Asia and Europe and solid execution of our revenue management strategies in the face of increasing demand across all our transportation segments.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
These gains were partially offset by four noteworthy factors. First higher variable incentive compensation expense of 485 million including a 125 million special bonus for global frontline team members at FedEx Express second lower revenues and higher costs due to significant weather events that reduced operating income by an estimated 350 million third the estimated impact of having one fewer operating week day which was approximately 150 million and lastly consolidated direct COVID19related cost of approximately 60 million which does not capture the many accommodations we continue to make across all our operations for the safety of our employees and to comply with various regulations and guidelines.,FDX,0.144716203212738,-0.7105686131528695,Negative
Given its significance I want to add further context around the adverse weather impact. First we always anticipate and have contingencies for demand and operational impacts during our fiscal third quarter which spans the most active winter weather months.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The mid to late February events in particular impacted many parts of the country but were historic throughout the South Central Corridor of the US.,FDX,0.0476736724376678,-0.9046537903867904,Negative
The snow amounts in Memphis had not been seen in over 50 years prior to the founding of FedEx and when coupled with a record time nine consecutive days below freezing had a significant impact on our operations as Fred and Raj mentioned. Our Indianapolis and North Texas Express hubs were impacted as well. Demand was deferred as significant portions of the US population were impacted by the various weather events.,FDX,0.0122893154621124,-0.9754225465193669,Negative
Of the 350 million estimated impact 240 million was at Express 85 million at Ground and 25 million at Freight. Despite that the Express segment reported adjusted operating profit of 514 million with an adjusted operating margin of 4.8 up 260 basis points driven by significant volume growth in both international export and US domestic package as well as higher international priority yields.,FDX,0.975339412689209,0.9506787959806895,Positive
In the quarter Express absorbed 340 million higher variable incentive compensation expense and was on pace to deliver record third quarter operating profit prior to the February weather.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
FedEx Ground had an exceptional peak and third quarter growing operating margin 270 basis points over the prior year to 8.8. Operating income of 702 million was the highest third quarter in FedEx Grounds history. Yield grew 11 while volumes were up 25 resulting in 37 growth in revenues which more than offset headwinds including increased payments to our independent service providers higher labor rates and higher variable incentive compensation of 70 million.,FDX,0.9885895252227784,0.9771790368432027,Positive
As Raj and Brie highlighted our commercial and operational initiatives are yielding and will continue to yield profitable growth at Ground as we capitalize on the ecommerce opportunity.,FDX,0.8455202579498291,0.6910403317453455,Positive
Turning to FedEx Freight operating income increased 5 despite the impact of increased variable compensation and the weather. Freight continues to post excellent results with their focus on revenue quality aligning their cost structure with current business levels and improving operational efficiencies. Freight also provided critical peak season operational support to both Ground and Express.,FDX,0.9422234892845154,0.8844469096940217,Positive
Our effective tax rate was 15 for the quarter due to tax benefits of 108 million resulting from a tax rate increase in the Netherlands applied to a deferred tax balances and associated with a 300 million voluntary contribution to our qualified US pension plans.,FDX,0.0365460813045501,-0.926908985918156,Negative
Now turning to whats ahead. While there remains a degree of uncertainty as we begin to see progress in combating the pandemic we are projecting full year adjusted earnings per share of 17.60 to 18.20 compared to 9.50 adjusted EPS in FY 2020. We expect our effective tax rate prior to the year end marktomarket adjustment to be between 21 and 22 for the full year fiscal 2021.,FDX,0.0239060223102569,-0.9521891189748759,Negative
We expect higher revenue operating income and operating margins on a yearoveryear basis at all our transportation segments in the fourth quarter which does include one additional operating week day.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
These forecasts assume continued recovery in US industrial production and global trade no additional COVID19related business restrictions and current fuel price expectations. With this forecast we expect higher variable incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter as we plan to reward our employees for their achievements this year. The yearoveryear increase is expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter excluding the 125 million special bonus I mentioned previously.,FDX,0.9954664707183838,0.9909329360323762,Positive
Earlier Fred mentioned our sustainability initiatives and we will record our 100 million pledge to Yale University in our fourth quarter results. For Express in the fourth quarter there will be no benefit from the reduction in the aviation excise tax and the CARES Act which expired on December 31st.,FDX,0.9819268584251404,0.9638536953054042,Positive
In addition Express maintenance costs will be higher yearoveryear in the fourth quarter as we execute on our flexible air fleet strategy. Just over a year ago we shared with you plans to temporarily park the equivalent of seven MD11s. Given the increased demand we are efficiently adding needed capacity for our customers by investing in maintenance expense to utilize aircraft from temporary storage. As of now we plan to have no temporarily parked MD11s prior to next peak season. This illustrates our ability to flex capacity up or down in a financially efficient manner in response to changes in the market.,FDX,0.965418577194214,0.9308371131641349,Positive
Our capital spending focus remains on strategic investments that will reduce our cost structure improve our efficiency and increase our capacity to profitably meet market growth demands.,FDX,0.9426568150520324,0.8853135617456207,Positive
Our FY 2021 CapEx forecast is now 5.7 billion due to changes in the timing of aircraft payments as well as the acceleration of FedEx Ground capacity initiatives. That projects to roughly 6.9 of expected revenue which is the lowest level in over 10 years. While we have not finalized our FY 2022 plans capital spending will increase as we invest in capacity and proceed with investments in replacement capital previously deferred. That said I anticipate CapEx as a percentage of revenue will be 8 or less which remains less than our historical capital intensity. Well provide more specifics in June.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Looking at liquidity on the balance sheet we ended the third quarter with 8.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and on Tuesday renewed our 2 billion fiveyear credit agreement and 1.5 billion 364day credit agreement. The key aspect of our capital allocation strategy moving forward will be strengthening our balance sheet and repayment of outstanding debt. Given our strong cash flows and liquidity position we are evaluating potential transactions to reduce and refinance existing debt. The timing of any transaction will be based on market conditions and we would incur costs related to these transactions which may be material.,FDX,0.9020761251449584,0.8041521335554918,Positive
Ill close by reiterating I have great confidence in our ability to build on the successes we have had this year as we execute our plans to generate sustainable longterm growth in earnings and cash flow.,FDX,0.9616817235946656,0.9233634015103589,Positive
And with that we can move to the questionandanswer session.,FDX,0.8891158103942871,0.7782314886042407,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. Operator Instructions And first well go to Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is open.,FDX,0.9988864660263062,0.9977729307251755,Positive
Yeah. Hey thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe I want to start on the Ground side and understand I guess first around Ground pricing so significant progress has been made so far. But I wanted to get a sense of where do you think you are in the process of repricing this product up for the service that youre offering and ultimately the demand in the market right now,FDX,0.9997157454490662,0.9994314905592743,Positive
And then maybe as we think about hows that and mix may impact margins as we move forward say into fiscal 2022 clearly weve moved  are very heavily overweight towards B2C over the course of the last 12 months. But as B2B grows it maybe even takes a little bit of market share. How should that play through your ground margins,FDX,0.9161273241043092,0.8322545482245378,Positive
Thanks for the question Chris. Its Brie speaking. You know from a yield strategy perspective we still believe we have opportunity from a mix perspective. As you saw this quarter was probably the most dramatic or not probably was the most dramatic movement weve been able to make from a product perspective. Youre going to see that shift throughout this year as capacity  we anticipate capacity throughout this calendar year will be constrained.,FDX,0.99821937084198,0.9964387395612833,Positive
And as a result as I mentioned weve got to prioritize our SAM growth. You heard 35. Its the best segment performance weve got from a small perspective. So were going to prioritize that. It will continue to work our yields up. In addition to that the FedEx economy product is something that we are very focused on and it will add dramatic yield upside from here out. Henry,FDX,0.9999815225601196,0.9999630450982124,Positive
Hi Chris. Let me take the margin question. First of all in Q4 we expect teens  margins to be in the teens. But let me speak to how we see the business beyond that. First we believe theres considerable operating leverage still to be realized in this business.,FDX,0.994620442390442,0.9892408783679478,Positive
Strategic initiatives will help ensure the right packages are on the right sort on the right day for ontime delivery. They also ensure that overnight sorts are reserved for nextday volume enabling the right balance of sort capacity in the network. These are critical capabilities for a sevenday network operation.,FDX,0.982893705368042,0.9657873903437795,Positive
Were also implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort staffing headcount more closely to volumes thereby improving dock productivity and our dock expense. And were rolling out capabilities for certain upstream volume in the network to bypass station sortation and transfer directly to delivery vehicles freeing up valuable station capacity.,FDX,0.9986497163772584,0.9972994311448524,Positive
None of these initiatives require brickandmortar. Theyre possible through industry leading technology AI and machine learning and are developed using a safe agile framework and tools. So with all of that in my view as we continue to transform the FedEx Ground business FedEx Grounds best days are still ahead of them.,FDX,0.9907070398330688,0.9814140685880592,Positive
Thanks for the time.,FDX,0.9445977210998536,0.8891953761550049,Positive

Great. Good afternoon. Let me switch over to Express. And I guess if you exclude the weather impacts the 4.8 goes up to maybe upper singledigits in terms of margin. Maybe you could talk about the  Brie the return of B2B on the Express side same thing that you were just talking on Ground. Maybe you were talking about pricing starting to disappear in 12 months. So how do you look at this business Do you see it transitioning back to doubledigit margins or is there some structural change that keeps that at the singledigit levels,FDX,0.9999494552612304,0.9998989104622067,Positive
Hi Ken. Its Brie. Ill start with the pricing and the yield element and then turn it back over to Don and Mike. From a yield perspective and from a B2B as we mentioned as of January here in the United States our B2B volume was back to preCOVID level. The mix within the B2B wasnt what historically we have seen. It was obviously heavy healthcare heavy retail heavy tech. We have not seen it fully come back in automotive and industrial. So we think that theres some upside there.,FDX,0.9977759122848512,0.9955518219183817,Positive
When you look at the B2B volume outside of the United States at a whole holistic level were back but Europe is not. So we see there still opportunity intraEurope and intercontinental outbound from Europe. The European team has done a phenomenal job of shoring up volume but it is B2C volume that theyve shored up that gap with. So I still think that there is some B2B upside coming out of Europe still.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
From a yield perspective were feeling pretty confident in our yields throughout this calendar year from an International Express as well as a Domestic Express. There is pressure on the yield from a weight perspective because the ecommerce mix will continue to increase outside of the United States at Express. So overall were quite comfortable from a yield growth and opportunity perspective for the next 12 months and Ill turn it over to Mike,FDX,0.9999349117279052,0.9998698233782191,Positive
Yes. Chris as I said this is Mike. Certainly in the fourth quarter well see margin gains at all three of the transportation segments. You cant get to the guidance that we put out there without that falling into place as well as the other context I gave you.,FDX,0.1122446656227111,-0.7755117270420356,Negative
And were highly confident we can build on the momentum here with the strategies and the plans that have been outlined but were not going to be given forward margin expectations. Well have more to say about our outlook for 2022 in June. Don,FDX,0.9129030704498292,0.8258060370719655,Positive
Yes Mike and Brie just to add a few things to your comments. One is I think Raj had mentioned in his prepared remarks about the strength of the quarter. And it was a strong quarter for us highlighted by the best December weve had in the companys history and on track to provide that same level of performance for the quarter until the weather hit.,FDX,0.9197582602500916,0.8395164248445182,Positive
Now this is not a comment about would have should have could have but it really is one to highlight the strong fundamentals that exist in the Express business right now. Were extremely confident of the fundamentals that well continue to deliver into the fourth quarter as evidence of what weve seen.,FDX,0.9935647249221802,0.98712944217291,Positive
We had 1.9 billion of revenue growth in that quarter. I thank our excellent sales team around the globe and a wonderful job that the Express operating unit did in terms of monetizing and turning that into a strong performance.,FDX,0.9975382685661316,0.9950765341976489,Positive
As it relates to what were seeing from a yield perspective. I agree obviously with Bries assessment. Were seeing some fundamentals in our international business that are quite clear to us in the short medium and maybe in the longer term.,FDX,0.9651752710342408,0.930350500554145,Positive
When inventory levels remain low supply is soft and demand is very strong. And we think that demand is going to even increase as the stimulus checks come into the marketplace.,FDX,0.0580010414123535,-0.8839990401262284,Negative
So we think if you look at it in terms of trifactor those fundamental economic issues that we have should continue to benefit us especially in our international business going forward.,FDX,0.1696409881114959,-0.660719013642677,Negative
Thanks Don. Mike Brie appreciate it.,FDX,0.9985607862472534,0.9971215707788292,Positive
And next well go to Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.,FDX,0.9901829957962036,0.9803659798896194,Positive
So thanks. Good afternoon. Sorry I was on mute. Just digging a little bit more in terms of the Ground revenue per piece and specifically on Q3 Brie or Henry could you maybe talk about or break out the contribution to the yield equivalent that came from base price versus the peak surcharges and then mix I guess what Im trying to think through is how to best think about the sequential yield change in Q4. Normally I think its up about 4. But obviously maybe the peak surcharges fall off you have some incremental surcharges in place. So just looking for a little bit of context in terms of breaking out the contribution of the different pieces there. Thank you.,FDX,0.999975860118866,0.999951720208955,Positive
Hi Allison. From a pricing strategy perspective obviously the vast majority of our volume is on highly complex contractual agreements. And so its quite difficult to streamline and break that out for you right now. But what I will tell you is from a Q3 perspective you saw really us very much focused on our FedEx Ground economy product. We know the spread between the FedEx Ground economy and our FedEx Ground home delivery product that yield spread historically has been too wide.,FDX,0.9999994039535522,0.999998807906394,Positive
So we are very focused on prioritizing capacity at the higheryielding home delivery product. And so youre going to see two things happen. Youre going to see us give more capacity to home delivery at the higher yield and youre going to see us increase the yield throughout this calendar year both through peak surcharges as well as through GRI strategies and quite frankly just contractual discussion. So thats really our focus is closing that gap prioritizing capacity for home delivery and making sure weve got capacity for our small and medium customers.,FDX,0.999987006187439,0.9999740123593881,Positive
Okay. And just any color on what sort of the peak surcharge impact was in Q3 from a dollar perspective or a percentage perspective,FDX,0.8691737055778503,0.7383472551985115,Positive
Were not going to give that out at this time Allison.,FDX,0.0538010597229003,-0.8923990085119061,Negative
Okay. Thank you guys.,FDX,0.9791457653045654,0.958291505748931,Positive
And next well go to Jack Atkins from Stephens. Your line is open.,FDX,0.9901829957962036,0.9803659798896194,Positive
Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. So Mike I guess maybe this one is for you. When I think about the fourth quarter implied guidance historically you see a fairly significant ramp in earnings from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And when you normalize for the weather and the lower tax rate your guidance  implied guidance is for maybe a 17 increase in earnings from third quarter to fourth quarter yypically its 50 to 60.,FDX,0.9999343752861024,0.9998687504939741,Positive
So Im just curious if maybe if you can walk us through some of the puts and takes there Is it a factor of just the broader economy Is some uncertainty there Just some conservatism in general. Just can you help us think through the implied fourth quarter guidance and why you wouldnt see more of a normal seasonal ramp there Thank you.,FDX,0.9959326982498168,0.9918653916510292,Positive
Jack Im not going to get into decomping all of the puts and takes that come into seasonality. I guess I would refer back to when I mentioned an effective tax rate for the year of 21 to 22 that implies a higher tax rate in Q4 than our  typically you can rule a thumb for a full year.,FDX,0.9718543887138368,0.9437087438754703,Positive
The statutory federal rate is 21 3 or 4 for state and other. So 25 on a kind of normalized basis. But as weve mentioned on the call we have had about 300 million of discrete events through yeartodate in Q1 to Q3.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So I think when you kind of normalize for that and look at our underlying operating performance there it is a very strong Q4 and Ill leave it at that. I talked about some of the other elements that will play into Q4 earlier so I wont rehash those. But I think when you are able to piece it all together it will be a very solid operating Q4.,FDX,0.01648810505867,-0.9670249623209014,Negative
Okay. Thank you.,FDX,0.9836810827255248,0.9673621459973727,Positive
And next well go to Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.,FDX,0.9901829957962036,0.9803659798896194,Positive
Yeah. Hi afternoon. Question when you think beyond the fiscal fourth quarter of this year and into the next fiscal year you start getting to some difference in tougher volume comps especially in the Ground. Is your expectation though that with ecommerce continuing even at a decelerating pace that you could still grow the overall volume levels yearoveryear Thanks.,FDX,0.9566904902458192,0.9133809288626487,Positive
I guess the short answer is yes. Were anticipating that the market growth 90 of the market growth is going to come through ecommerce. Weve got a longterm outlook at more than 10 CAGR from an ecommerce perspective. So the short answer is yes.,FDX,0.9940611124038696,0.9881222177280293,Positive
And Mike Im sure would like to add something.,FDX,0.9889140129089355,0.9778280126023369,Positive
Yeah. Jordan just  we threw a lot of numbers at you. But as Brie mentioned we went from 62 to 70 residential mix and FedEx Grounds margins were up 270 basis points. So I think that speaks to how we plan to execute on the continued growth of ecommerce.,FDX,0.0160636007785797,-0.9678739713871308,Negative
And of course we will be giving an FY 2022 earnings forecast in June. That has been something thats not been available during the pandemic from a lot of companies. But with the forecast that Mike just gave you for the fourth quarter you can anticipate a full year FY 2022 range at our June call.,FDX,0.9749194979667664,0.9498389660352267,Positive

Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Mike can you talk to the outlook within CapEx is going to be below 8 of revenue and when you look forward on these projects because I think you mentioned accelerating some of the Ground investments there,FDX,0.9999581575393676,0.999916315028855,Positive
Brandon you broke up a little bit but if I understand asking about one of the CapEx references. So as we said volume grew 25 at Ground. And so as we came through December evaluating and looking at whats ahead and the opportunity there we see that as opportunity. Also if you look at our  when you get the chance to look at the stat book in terms of the maintenance CapEx you can see that our facilities and vehicles we deferred a lot of that this year. So there will be some amount of those that  going forward as well. So well be  well certainly give you more specifics on that when it comes to June.,FDX,0.9996526837348938,0.9993053670557541,Positive
Yeah Mike I guess I was asking like in the longer term context what are the type of return Technical Difficulty these projects,FDX,0.8124665021896362,0.6249327808217888,Positive
I think the question is about returns. You broke up again. I will say with very absolute confidence that all of these investments were making will generate a solid return on investment just as the investments weve made in the last few years are showing results today.,FDX,0.8296394348144531,0.6592786665431658,Positive

Thanks operator. Hi everybody. Henry I was hoping I could ask you about Ground margins if thats okay I think the key question and discussion point weve all had is the longterm outlook for Ground margins given the secular shift to B2C and the density challenges that obviously come with that. I mean you guys have made incredible progress on pricing and operations.,FDX,0.9999653100967408,0.9999306201521281,Positive
Im just wondering if you can update us  you gave a little bit of it last quarter but hoping you can update us on what you think the sustainable margins for Ground  the Ground business are on an annual basis And when do you think you can get there And just related to that you guys called out 350 million of weather. I was hoping you could talk about what the attribution to Ground business was from that number. Thank you.,FDX,0.9893453121185304,0.9786906115356755,Positive
Amit this is Mike. As I said in my remarks 85 million of the weather was Ground. Again weve said weve given you fourth quarter guidance. Well have more to say about future outlook in  for FY 2022 in June. But were very confident of our ability to build on the momentum of generating increased returns and profitability at ground.,FDX,0.9953796863555908,0.9907593672033352,Positive
Can I ask it another way then since its the same question And the spread between pricing costs in Ground was in excess of 300 basis points per package. As B2C recovers is there any reason why the spread between price and cost per package should moderate over the next four to five six quarters,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Well I think the last two quarters weve given you some guidance on what weve seen unit costs do as we move through the pandemic and we move through the shift in the mix of our business. Obviously were going to lap some of those results but weve had significant reductions in our unit costs as weve gone through the last year as a result of many of the strategic initiatives weve outlined here and were in frankly in Rajs comments. We continue to see considerable operating leverage in the business and we would expect margins to improve over time.,FDX,0.7883755564689636,0.5767508606617813,Positive
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.,FDX,0.9967825412750244,0.9935650787145369,Positive
And next well go to Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open.,FDX,0.991300106048584,0.98260020172608,Positive
Yes good afternoon. Lets see. I wanted to  I think one of the questions that seems to come up is concern about potential to have some of that strength in international rates thats beneficial for Express that eventually some of that profitability is going to go back as past devicebased comes back. And presumably thats out very quickly and that you retain a portion of it. I wanted to see if you could give us a sense of the potential offset from your cost initiatives.,FDX,0.9868888854980468,0.9737777553664178,Positive
Those numbers if you look at a couple of years are they potentially in the same magnitude And Im thinking in particular of integration of some of the B2C shipments for Express and Ground but thats helpful on the cost side and potentially TNT and maybe you have other things in mind. Thank you.,FDX,0.991395890712738,0.9827917711685723,Positive
So Tom this is Raj. Ill address it overall. Obviously its not possible to give out the numbers by the individual items that you just talked about. However we  let me address it broadly by first saying that the capacity and the commercial carrier  passenger carriers we dont expect it to come back in the next 12 months maybe more and we expect the premium to remain for that period of time.,FDX,0.1264971494674682,-0.7470067423622266,Negative
Even if it does come back we have the opportunity to flex it flex our networks. We can  and that is  we have demonstrated the capability to flex up. And we will be able to flex it down as needed and they become our partner networks to move deferred traffic.,FDX,0.0234343111515045,-0.9531325418547045,Negative
Thirdly theres a lot of activity thats going on to continue to improve margins in FedEx Express. Our transformation in Europe was one of  expansion of lastmile optimization is another and very solid activity. So we feel very confident about our future of our Express around the world. I dont know Don if you want to add anything more to that,FDX,0.9909889698028564,0.9819779288637214,Positive
I think you hit it Raj. But clearly we have a playbook on margin  improving margin expansion in both our domestic and international business. I think you touched upon and I did in my earlier comments about why were confident over the medium term that the supply and demand curve works in our favor.,FDX,0.9961156249046326,0.9922312451787265,Positive
Capacity is light and we think it will continue to remain that way until people start traveling again on an intercontinental basis. We dont think that happens for the next 12 to 18 months because of the various levels of quarantine restrictions that are in all parts of the globe.,FDX,0.117930382490158,-0.7641402865292352,Negative
Were working one of the things that I would want to highlight that you didnt talk to is our lastmile optimization plans and the impact that that has on our margin. I think our Chairman says density is our destiny. And as we can continue to improve the density in the either of our networks its very much margin accretive.,FDX,0.8624355792999268,0.7248709946101872,Positive
Were celebrating the oneyear anniversary coming up on lastmile optimization working very closely with Henry and his team. And were driving a significant amount of volume through the Ground network. And that those numbers are accelerating on a sequential weekoverweek monthovermonth basis.,FDX,0.9777674674987792,0.9555349084942986,Positive
So theres a lot of leverage that we can pull in our business the European transformation the domestic transformation. But we have multiple playbooks in play as we speak to continue with our margin improvement and expansion.,FDX,0.9856637120246888,0.9713274069591804,Positive
Let me add something to that. The LMO initiative benefits in two ways. One it takes loweryielding residential packages and deferred packages and rural packages out of the Express network allowing the Express system to concentrate on the high priority B2B and the verticals particularly those that require ancillary services like SenseAware ID which is on every single box of vaccines that were now delivering. I mean its almost been flawless the execution of that. And you can count on your hand the number of issues with the number of vaccines weve delivered in the millions.,FDX,0.9978432059288024,0.9956864092865043,Positive
And so Express is able to be more Express in the B2C and the less dense areas are more cost effectively served. So its not just one side. It helps on both sides which is what Don mentioned about the density because as we get more residential packages that are not Express in nature time definite or something that somebody needs in a residence that Express has to deliver it helps Grounds density its cost its asset utilization.,FDX,0.9964494705200196,0.9928989368074759,Positive
And I think one of the things that I listen to these calls the last call we had 13 questions on Ground margins. I dont know. Were not going to have 13 this time but weve probably got half a dozen so far wouldnt that be close,FDX,0.0023071765899658,-0.995386836163304,Negative
So one of the things thats hard for us to communicate to this group Henry has mentioned is the fantastic effect of this technology that weve been rolling out. We dont advertise it all the time but Rob and his team and some of the fantastic work we have going on in other ways thats why the confidence level is so high that we can achieve these things in the future.,FDX,0.9522689580917358,0.9045378592836018,Positive
So what you all want us to do is to give it to you in a quarterly forecast and so forth but some of the numbers that Raj laid out there for you I mean theyre stunning in the productivity improvements. So I think its important to look a bit at the bigger picture of some of these things.,FDX,0.9861031174659728,0.9722062183655609,Positive
And finally Ill say we have a plan to improve Express margins with a lot of passenger capacity in the marketplace and a plan to improve it without a lot of passenger in the market. Its not an eitheror situation.,FDX,0.9429128170013428,0.8858255659494196,Positive
And so those are the two recurring questions that come up in these calls. The ecommerce are going to go back because everybody  the pandemic is over and your margins arent going to get better and youre not going to do well in Express because the passenger is coming back.,FDX,0.0001251995563507,-0.999750792831655,Negative
Those are inherent in most of the questions these last two calls. Both of those are wrong. So I felt I had to step in finally. Ive tried not to answer any questions but youre going down the wrong rabbit hole on both of those areas.,FDX,0.0078994929790496,-0.9842021967185718,Negative
I think if I can just offer one more thought. I think its just like the magnitude it seems like theyre pretty big programs and pretty favorable. So I think my question was just trying to understand if youre going to give us a sense of the magnitude at some point. But they may  I mean what youre doing at makes a ton of sense and seems to be a big factor in the results. So anyway just  thanks for all the good perspective on it.,FDX,0.9999774694442748,0.9999549388616911,Positive
And next well go to Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.,FDX,0.9939581155776978,0.9879162239529038,Positive
Hey I guess that rules out asking seven more Ground questions. Just a couple for me how much of that 350 million is cost versus volume pushed out into this quarter,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Well I will tell you most of the 350 million was revenue related. We did have incremental costs at Express for of course beyond normal expectations for deicing and snow removal additional labor costs.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then I think a couple of you have noted that we had a significant event with one of our facilities in the Netherlands there as well with the roof collapse so that is a cost that was in the number as well. But principally it is revenue from that. And Ill let Brie talk about the overall evolution of where we are now.,FDX,0.9056934118270874,0.811386711231894,Positive
Yes I guess the best way to think about March is the fundamentals are back. So were very confident. If we take February out our fundamentals look a lot like they did in January B2B is strong SMB is back Ground is in good shape. So it was February revenue but we feel very confident about the fundamentals in March.,FDX,0.99960857629776,0.9992171521289064,Positive
Thank you. And then just a quick highlevel on vaccine distribution. I wonder if you could talk about any surprises versus your initial expectations either the level of activity youve seen or which segment is being utilized And thanks for taking the questions.,FDX,0.9999881982803344,0.9999763965466,Positive
Yes. Thanks and it gives me an opportunity to brag on the team a little bit. So I guess if there is any surprised me and it shouldnt have is how amazing the team is it that provided this exemplary service. Richard Smith and his organization have done Yeomans work to make sure that these vaccines move through our network. As Fred said an extremely high level of efficiency a handful if that shipments that did not need service.,FDX,0.9751876592636108,0.950375288948589,Positive
I think whats important to note though when we talk about the vaccines is really not the raw in absolute numbers that move in our network. In the grand scheme of things when you look at almost 20 million packages a day moving through our network this represents a very small portion of that. But what is important to note is a profound impact that these shipments have when they get to destination. And it really just validates our purpose and its one we take very very seriously.,FDX,0.959196925163269,0.9183938016854534,Positive
The amount of lives that we potentially save the amount of people we put back to work amount of small businesses that reopen the borders that can reopen back to normal levels. Thats really the story on that vaccines and thats what were most proud about. So I guess the surprise that really shouldnt have been is the amazing work that our team has done to galvanize and be energized around this purpose. And they take that purpose very personally. Get up every morning thinking about the mission that we have to get these vaccines to market so we can get them in folks on. So I couldnt be more proud of the team in the way that brought these vaccines to market globally. So thanks for asking that question.,FDX,0.9999974370002748,0.9999948739974942,Positive
Yes let me also jump in on that. I couldnt wait to  this is one of the most important work that we have done. And to do the work to be honest we need a network. And by that I mean youll be able to pick it up in any one part of the world and deposit in any other part of the world in a couple of days. That requires a network. And only a couple of people can actually do  a couple of companies can actually do that and we do that very well.,FDX,0.9999770522117616,0.9999541043961673,Positive
But you also tied to it the technology component the SenseAware ID that Fred talked about thats we rolled that out last year. I mean it was perfectly timed for the vaccines to provide unprecedented visibility. And we also launched FedEx Surround last year which provides the AI and ML predictive capability of what is going to happen. You put it all together we have the best service possible and as the Chairman pointed out extremely low level of failures. So again we are very proud of this work and continue to do our part in ending this pandemic.,FDX,0.8499727249145508,0.6999452709825462,Positive
And next well go to Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.,FDX,0.9901829957962036,0.9803659798896194,Positive
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back on the new service capabilities that you talked about within international. Is there a way to help us understand or quantify the market hole youre expecting to sell what drove the development of those products And any thought on mix Im assuming it would be a better mix business for you longer term. Any thoughts there,FDX,0.9976545572280884,0.9953091116601893,Positive
Sure. So I think when you think about what were going  what we have going on in the fourth quarter we really actually have three expansions from a service perspective. We will have actually we do have the fastest intraEuropean ground network as we completed the TNT ground network integration. That will provide growth both from a B2B perspective as well as a B2C perspective. So we are absolutely looking to take share intraEurope and we see that with the fastest network in Europe. Were confident we can do that.,FDX,0.9999992847442628,0.999998569487673,Positive
When you think about the intercontinental we actually today have the leading value proposition from Europe to the United States and were going to double that. So we are going to have a dramatic advantage over both UPS and DHL. Were adding nine origin countries. So its going to allow us to really expand both our B2B share as well as our B2C share outside of the major markets in Europe.,FDX,0.963021159172058,0.9260422742618764,Positive
And then third as were talking about FICP the same story outside of the United States is playing out everywhere in the world with more than 85 of our parcel growth opportunity coming in in ecommerce. And we did not have an international product that really had the right features of service for serving this massive growth opportunity. And we are underpenetrated.,FDX,0.9245810508728028,0.8491620118391587,Positive
Full disclosure we are behind both DHL and UPS in this market today so we see there only upside. When you think about FICP its features of service are different from our core B2B products in a couple of ways. Number one weve changed the clearance capabilities. So we now have lowvalue clearance capabilities or what we call type 86 which makes it a lower cost entry for the customer. We are automating our clearance capabilities which reduces the cost to serve. We are changing the terms and conditions on the number of attempts that we will make at the last mile.,FDX,0.9603302478790284,0.920660448467999,Positive
And of course were rolling out retail access points in Europe as well so that we can provide that access directly to retail again lowering the cost to serve. So in all three of these segments we believe weve got market share upside but probably most specifically on the overnight service to the United States its a B2B play. On FICP its a rapidly growing opportunity for ecommerce. I hope that helps clarify.,FDX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thats great. Thank you.,FDX,0.9984360933303832,0.9968721847964432,Positive
And next well go to Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.,FDX,0.9901829957962036,0.9803659798896194,Positive
Hey thanks afternoon guys. So Mike I just had a few questions for you. Youve been highlighting incentive comp the last few quarters. If we have more of a normal earnings growth year next year is more of a normal incentive comp headwind is that  thats my question. Then the corporate elimination volume has grown to like a run rate of about 1 billion a year. I think theres been a bunch of COVID losses in there. Is that something that should start to normalize to be less of a loss in the future,FDX,0.9879681468009948,0.9759362792588941,Positive
Well Scott one thing that I would mention in the corporate unallocated line as weve mentioned previously FedEx office results are in there and the printrelated revenue while ADV is up spectacularly at FedEx office the printrelated revenue is significantly impacted by the pandemic. So as we start to come through that we would anticipate well see some improvement there. On the variable comp I guess what I would say to you in that is we wouldnt anticipate that to be a headwind looking at FY 2022. I hope that helps.,FDX,0.99683678150177,0.9936735592326875,Positive
Thank you.,FDX,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive

Hi this is Yu Huali from UBS. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask questions. I actually have two questions. The first one is we can see that Jupais bottom line improved and turned profitable in the fourth quarter of 2020. May I ask what the factors contribute to the performance of Jupais in the first quarter,JP,0.999987006187439,0.9999740123593881,Positive

Thanks for your question. In the fourth quarter we saw further recovery in Chinas overall economy benefiting from the highly effective COVID19 control measures and resumption of production and business. Chinas GDP for the first time exceeded RMB 100 trillion in 2020 with an overall annual growth of 2.3 and an increase of 6.5 in the fourth quarter on a yearoveryear basis.,JP,0.8421028256416321,0.6842054630550523,Positive

Okay. Thank you Yu Huali. I will answer the second question. The global and Chinese economic outlook in 2021 is expected to continue to improve with the approval and the promotion of COVID19 vaccines. However there are still uncertainties due to the pandemic situation overseas. Jupai real focus on a few key strategies in 2021 for further development. We will work on improving customer experience continue to develop the companys product system and continue to focus on the secondary market.,JP,0.999001145362854,0.9980022895349798,Positive

Foreign Language,JP,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
First the companys frontline employees will focus on improving customer experience with help and support from our frontline health mid and back staff. Improving customer experience is a new strategic goal for the companys development in 2021 building upon our asset transparency system strategy. In 2020 Jupai has launched VIP exclusive events and invited key customers to communicate with our management. At the same time we will focus on the strategic value of financial technology empowerment optimize user experience and create an accurate user profile or more personalized marketing solutions in the future.,JP,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive

Secondly in terms of product offering Jupai will continue to develop the companys product systems including deepening our portfolio of real estate projects and broadening our equity overseas market and secondary market horizontally in order to provide highquality products and services to customers. To be more specific we will continue to leverage our traditional advantages in the real estate industry to select better opportunities under the guidance of the national strategy of Homes for living not for speculation and the stability control and we realize industry deadlines.,JP,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Jupais secondary market products saw rapid growth in 2020 and the future investment potential of the secondary market is very high. Our secondary market products as a proportion of the equity value of wealth management product distributed increased to RMB 1.17 billion in 2020 compared to RMB 290 million in 2019. In 2021 we will continue to focus on the secondary market and select highquality partners to offer better options for investors.

In 2020 we have faced the challenges grow by the pandemic to Jupai and Chinas wealth management industry. Jupai has worked to realize its potential actively adapt to market changes and create stable and highquality products for investors. In 2021 we will continue to work hard to make Jupai one of the top wealth management and asset management brands for high net worth individuals in China.,JP,0.9944220781326294,0.9888441496158538,Positive

Let me turn it over to you for some Safe Harbor and then we can kick it off with Ed Bastian CEO and Glen Hauenstein the President. Over to Delta.,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks Jamie. And Im incredibly fortunate to pass the baton to the amazing Julie Stewart whos sitting right here next to me.,DAL,0.9997352361679076,0.9994704720201919,Positive
Quick Safe Harbor statement before we move to the stuff everybody really wants to hear about. Ed and Glens comments contain forwardlooking statements that represent our beliefs or expectations about future events. All forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ.,DAL,0.9999001026153564,0.9998002051116259,Positive
Some of the factors that may cause these differences are described in our SEC filings. And Glen may also discuss nonGAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of any of those nonGAAP measures on our Investor Relations page at ir.delta.com.,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And with that I guess for the last time Ill turn it over to Ed.,DAL,0.0502503216266632,-0.8995004889371925,Negative
Well thank you Jill and we are really going to miss you. Youve done a wonderful job over an extended period of time. And I can tell you that while Julie is going to do a great job shes got big shoes to fill. And we look forward to staying in touch but thank you for everything over a very long and illustrious and a memorable career.,DAL,0.965692400932312,0.9313847609667545,Positive
Well its hard to believe that is about a year ago this week that we were last at the JPM Conference at the very start of the pandemic wondering what in the world we were going to be looking to  into the year and it was a very troubling time it was unsettling very very nervous.,DAL,0.0103040933609008,-0.9793929930883606,Negative
But I can tell you that while this has been the most difficult crisis of our history and our industry as well as Delta as a company I could not be more proud of our people. The great work theyve done the resilience theyve shown the focus about taking care of our customers and our operations our cash and so protecting our future to be able to talk to where were going to be going is remarkable.,DAL,0.9972180128097534,0.9944360223031177,Positive
And I think that over the course of the last year weve got into this point that we can start to have real  substantial discussions of the path forward and not only the path forward but how were going to emerge from this as a stronger airline as a more resilient airline and the things that weve learned over the course of the last year has really really been phenomenal.,DAL,0.9958168268203736,0.9916336486540134,Positive
So its because of that focus around all of our stakeholders focus on our people the focus on our customers taking good care of them the focus on ensuring our shareholders are kept apprised and done the best we could for our owners during this period of time as well as our community partners.,DAL,0.9073222875595092,0.8146444646385098,Positive
That holistic focus weve taken on the recovery is what gives me optimism as we start to see demand coming back in meaningful levels. And we start to see a  what I consider real glimmers of hope. And weve seen some glimmers of hope over the course of the last year but theyve been false hope I think  in most regards but this seems like its real it seems substantive. And weve got a long ways to go yet. Were in a much much better place than weve been in quite a period of time.,DAL,0.0022993683815002,-0.9954024525895433,Negative
As we updated our earnings today with a  with guidance materials the March quarter has started slower than we were anticipating but really accelerated the pace of recovery over the course of the quarter and while the numbers are going to be another large loss we expect because January and February travel demand was really low really suppressed by the spread of the virus the infections at peak levels the warnings from all authorities not just here in the US but around the world to stayathome orders and all the work that was needed to do to contain the virus.,DAL,5.260109901428223e-05,-0.9998959898328721,Negative
The real story for the quarter kicked in about five or six weeks ago when we started to see bookings pickup. And that coincided clearly with confidence in the marketplace. People are starting to book their spring and summer plans and Glens going to be giving you an update on the commercial front in terms of what that means for us.,DAL,0.9652880430221558,0.9305760446644096,Positive
When we look within our quarter it looks to us that for the month of March we expect our top line revenues to be about 40 higher than what we saw in the month of February which is a big stepup.,DAL,0.9800875186920166,0.9601750136464915,Positive
Of course you always expect a meaningful stepup from February to March. And so its good to see some traditional seasonality starting to come out. Historically that seasonality has been in the lowtomid 30 range. So to get to 40 stepup from February to March is nice.,DAL,0.999131679534912,0.9982633580347047,Positive
And I think our teams done a good job on cost as well as weve gotten ready for the recovery. But fuels the other thing that conspired to keep our losses high within the March quarter as fuels at the levels we havent seen in quite a period of time.,DAL,0.2416746914386749,-0.5166515211174019,Negative
Cash burn for us is coming in pretty close to the midpoint of what we forecasted. We forecasted at the start of the quarter a cash burn on a daily basis of between 10 million and 15 million a day looks like its going to come in between 12 million and 14 million a day.,DAL,0.0053145289421081,-0.9893721278739739,Negative
But the thing that weve noticed in cash burn and probably for me one of the big takeaways for our conference today is at Delta we expect in the month of March to be at or pretty darn close to breakeven for the month of March cash burn.,DAL,0.0083338320255279,-0.9833335181078424,Negative
So cash burn for the month of March because of the booking improvements that weve seen over the course of the last few weeks it is going to come in pretty close to zero.,DAL,0.0094506442546844,-0.9810998923181846,Negative
And that gives us good exit velocity as we leave the quarter and as we look to the spring weve mentioned in the past that our goal is to get to a breakeven cash performance for the spring which to us was the second quarter.,DAL,0.9854675531387328,0.9709350889534285,Positive
And I continue to be cautiously optimistic that we will see the traction where were seeing here were going to hold it. And then as the recovery continues to take shape gain strength into the summer with the return to profitability for Delta hopefully in the third quarter.,DAL,0.9499418139457704,0.8998835682174973,Positive
Now of course those forecasts are expectation that the vaccines will continue to rollout that herd immunity will probably be achieved in our country probably hopefully at some point in the latter part of the second quarter the late spring or early summer. And that gives confidence back to domestic travel coming back out in a robust way.,DAL,0.0882910192012786,-0.8234190484398893,Negative
Im speaking to you today from Park City Utah. And I was mentioning to Jamie before the call that you wouldnt even know theres a pandemic going on. Its  everybodys out. And people are really looking to get their life back. People are wanting to travel domestically.,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Of course business travel is going to be delayed and Glen will talk about that. But business travel we see starting to pickup a bit as well. And international will be somewhere between six months to 12 months behind that.,DAL,0.1232930421829223,-0.7534149607509142,Negative
So with that Im going to turn it over to Glen to give a quick update on the commercial front. Ill come back to talk a little bit more about where were ending up in cash. And then well open it up to QA. Glen,DAL,0.995890498161316,0.9917809914237212,Positive
Great. Thanks Ed. And before I start Id just like to also echo your comments. It truly is the end of an era here with Jill retiring its going to be quite a different experience at all of our investor conferences moving forward.,DAL,0.9892247915267944,0.9784495702085318,Positive
And I just want to add my thanks because weve traveled all over the world together the last 15 years and its been quite a great experience. So thank you for all your leadership Jill and youll be sorely missed. And Julie I know youre going do a fantastic job. So welcome.,DAL,0.9999471306800842,0.9998942612971433,Positive
As Ed said weve made some great progress here at the end of March really for the last five or six weeks weve seen a very different trajectory in terms of forward bookings. As the US case counts came down from their late January peak and vaccinations continued to run out in the marketplace. So weve seen what we would consider to be a lot of pentup demand for primarily domestic and shorthaul international leisure travel.,DAL,0.0497249662876129,-0.9005512002415659,Negative
This past week digital shopping for  as a forward looking marker were 70 restored to our 2019 levels and thats up nearly 15 points from December. And of course our looktobook ratios are continuing to strengthen. So weve seen across all AP windows some very good strength. And thats really to talk a little bit about that thats very different from anywhere else that weve been in the pandemic with  the further out bookings now starting to come in.,DAL,0.0500305294990539,-0.899940073454424,Negative
The one thing that was consistent throughout the entire pandemic was the compression of the booking window were inside of 14 and inside of six days where most of your bookings resided. And really in the past six weeks weve seen that move out so that bookings that are beyond 60 days are almost flat to 2019 levels just down a few points. And thats a very different situation from where weve been in the last year so very encouraging signs there.,DAL,0.2351540327072143,-0.5296928463535586,Negative
Corporate as Ed mentioned is still slowly but steadily building back. Were in highteens to low 20s in terms of corporate. And those are major corporations SMEs are slightly ahead of that and theyve been accelerating at a slightly higher pace than the true large corporate travel.,DAL,0.2128188014030456,-0.5743633355875825,Negative
But we do expect that from all the surveys that weve seen out in the marketplace that that will continue to accelerate with many people returning to the office late in 2Q or early in 3Q. So setting up well as we go through the historic leisure period of the summer to have significant increase in bookings for business as we turn into the fall as looking forward.,DAL,0.0550694465637207,-0.8898622333182296,Negative
We have of course not yet released our middle seat. Our middle seat block is still in place. And that is going to be an incredibly powerful tool. If you think that we were able to get to cash breakeven in the month of March with over 30 of our inventory thats out flying not being sold as demand continues to return. And as we release those seats into the future thats going to be an incredibly strong lever for us with very minimal cost open those seats up.,DAL,0.8253093361854553,0.6506184641232873,Positive
So I think where were sitting right now is a very different place than where we were sitting last we spoke and one that were very encouraged with and one that we see signs across the board. I would say the one thing thats still the wild card is the longhaul international and when that will open up and weve been working very hard as you know we have several corridors open for quarantine pretravel to Europe which are doing quite well.,DAL,0.997721552848816,0.9954431029815098,Positive
But while were doing very well in the US right now with case counts continuing to decline and vaccinations continuing to accelerate thats not the case all over the world yet. So we think thats going to be a spotty return. And hopefully we can get towards late summer a reopening of the Transatlantic which would be the next thing we really need to achieve here. So lots of encouraging signs but lots of room to grow and lots of room to continue to improve as we move through spring.,DAL,0.0436065196990966,-0.9127881007123595,Negative
With that I guess Ill turn it back over to Ed.,DAL,0.2141807675361633,-0.571639401697756,Negative
Well thank you Glen. That is encouraging. We expect to end the March quarter with 16.5 billion of liquidity and that includes the 2.9 billion of PSP 2 funds that we received during the March quarter does not include any of the PSP 3 funds in that estimate which we expect to receive a similar amount to the 2.9 billion of the PSP 2.,DAL,0.9815789461135864,0.9631578702675523,Positive
Since the beginning of the pandemic one of the things that has really enabled the U.S. airline industry to emerge from this crisis as relatively strong bruised but relatively strong is weve been able to get out compared to the airline industry in any other part of the world really has been the support of congress the administration or elected officials both previous administration the current Biden administration we do really appreciate the support that weve received from them.,DAL,0.970431923866272,0.9408638124846294,Positive
That liquidity guide that I gave of 16.5 is lower than what we guided back in January largely due to the decision that we made to repay the 1.5 billion of slots gates and routes term loan that we took out in the March quarter a year ago. This brings our total debt repayments to over 7 billion since October includes the revolver the 364day term loan as well as the slots gates and routes term loan that I mentioned.,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And in the June quarter we expect to  it isnt ph a normal amortization of debt which includes the 600 million of unsecurity maturity thats due in April. We plan on acquiring aircraft with cash and accelerating up to 1 billion or potentially even a bit more of voluntary contributions into our pension plans.,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So as you can see the balance sheet recovery is back in full earnest at Delta. We know the strength of our balance sheet is one of the things that enabled us to manage through the worst crisis in our industry without having to dilute our shareholders. Its something that has set us apart within the industry and were already starting down the path to recover the balance sheet. We look forward to getting those investment grade ratings back here over the next couple of years.,DAL,0.0385023057460784,-0.9229965347030967,Negative
So while the last year has been incredibly difficult for everyone in our industry probably has been one of the poster childs for that degree of difficulty Ive said many times through this crises that crisis reveals character and could not be more proud of the character of the people of Delta Airlines the values that we show in terms of taking care of our people and our customers and positioning us well for what I consider year two of the pandemic which is for us year one of the recovery which starts in earnest this month.,DAL,0.0204903483390808,-0.9590204709890312,Negative
With that Jamie well turn it back to you and Mark and pleased to take any questions. Thank you.,DAL,0.9975190162658693,0.9950380295741736,Positive
By the way I do  before I do that one other thing I want to mention that in addition to Jills retirement and Julie Abley taking on Jills shoes weve also made the announcement to promote Ken Morge as Senior Vice President Finance and Treasurer. Ken has been a stalwart through this  for many years but particularly through this last year. He was probably the most important person at Delta indiscernible for many many days within the last year at Delta and really appreciate all the good work that Ken has done. So thank you Ken for your work and great to see you get a well deserved promotion.,DAL,0.9999988079071044,0.9999976158127877,Positive

Q  Jamie Baker,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Alright thats great. Thank you gentlemen. First question for Glen. Your good friend Paul Jacobson in the past spoke about a profitable cohabitation with ultra low cost carriers but these airlines are undoubtedly emboldened by the downturn. Weve got some startups in the wings. Theyre the tip of the recovery sphere because they are all leisure they dont have corporate or international networks to worry about. How does the pandemic change the domestic interplay between operating models And why shouldnt we assume that discounters emerge with more share and Delta with less,DAL,0.9776618480682372,0.9553236695073064,Positive
Well you know I think that were not playing a share game. Were playing a profit game. And were very very secure in our offerings. And I think when you think about what our objective has been through the pandemic it has continued to offer bestinclass no matter what your travel needs are. And Id say one of the things that we all will work on as we continue to release the seats or as we look to release the seats towards the summer is that we will have more seats in the lower fare categories.,DAL,0.9953880310058594,0.99077605651382,Positive
And I think when you look at what some of our objectives were going through the pandemic was to make sure we came out stronger and that in the places that we chose to compete that we did not see share. And I think when you look at how weve done even with this seat block in all of our core hubs we have maintained the share levels at prepandemic levels. And we think that will serve as well as we continue to move towards the back end of this and  and are able to put the full level of inventory back in play here.,DAL,0.0067592561244964,-0.9864826717869473,Negative
So I do see that a lot of them think that they had a great opportunity there. But the other thing that weve been working on through the pandemic is improving our fleet mix. And you know that peaceful cohabitation that Paul described was when we are able to put our large stage equipment up against them some of our highest margins are directly against your LCC in LCC market. So thats another piece that weve accelerated in the pandemic. So I think were going to come through as I mentioned earlier stronger than ever.,DAL,0.9893240332603456,0.9786480537939395,Positive
Okay. Well lets bring Ed into that conversation because the initial market view several months ago was that Delta and the industry would not return to prior margin levels given due to corporate demand higher debt levels and so forth. Obviously the markets view is far more optimistic today. But what level of confidence do you have that Delta cannot only return to but exceed your prior margins and what are the primary drivers there,DAL,0.9802381992340088,0.9604763749101013,Positive
Well Jimmy I agree. I  our goal is to not just get back to the margins of our business but to exceed them. I think weve got a real  a real good path to do that. When you think about three of the core ingredients to that first of all the strength of our customer interactions the strength of our brand arguably has never been stronger. As weve gone through the pandemic weve seen a full 20 point increase in Net Promoter Scores. Our Net Promoter Scores are in the 70 range.,DAL,0.9863780736923218,0.9727561311460322,Positive
And that was one of the reasons and  and thats despite the fact that we were blocking those seats or maybe because in some cases but you saw the premium that we were also receiving on the revenue front through that crisis. I think we  over the course of the last  the last couple of quarters weve generated more passenger revenue compared to our main competitors despite the fact that we had significantly fewer seats available for sale that really strengthens the proposition of the Delta brand.,DAL,0.0048864483833312,-0.9902282895018398,Negative
I cant tell you every single day I get notes from customers thanking us for how we treat them. And by the way its not just the middle seat block thats been a part of it. But its really been the great work our team has done throughout that. So I think were entering through this with a stronger brand and more differentiated brand.,DAL,0.998971164226532,0.9979423272265955,Positive
Were going to come through this with a streamlined cost structure. Weve retired 200 of our oldest planes weve got another 200 planes that were going to be accelerating the retirement of that those efficiencies that were going to  were going to garner from that weve looked at  our staffing were down about 20 in overall headcount because of the early retirement arrangements. And weve had to be pretty creative than how weve managed our cost. Our costs have been down close to 50 throughout the pandemic and theres a lot that weve gained from that. The one thing that I  its going to take a little bit of time to repair is that  is that balance sheet strength.,DAL,0.9946686625480652,0.9893373187406771,Positive
So the higher debt load but were going to come through it in pretty pretty good state. The investments were making in our pension as I talked about theyre going to help us in that regard also improve improve the reduction of debt and the improved performance of the pension assets.,DAL,0.9600045680999756,0.9200090885216525,Positive
But I think the one area that is maybe more important than any of that is international performance. When we think about how were coming through this. Were arguably as an industry the US industry coming through this on an international basis in a much stronger way than any country I can think of around the world.,DAL,0.9702762961387634,0.9405525568440896,Positive
The landscape is different. The strength of our partnerships are going to be the  even more important to us. And I think the area Delta had the greatest opportunity to improve prepandemic was in our international margins. And I see no reason why our international margins cant go viable our domestic margins as we come through this over the next couple of years.,DAL,0.8460946083068848,0.6921890331441363,Positive
And a quick followup on that before cutting over to Mark. First what is that or what was that margin lag going into the downturn We have that number from United. Please refresh my memory for Delta.,DAL,0.9762080907821656,0.9524161532021485,Positive
And then Ed you also  you speak about the brand. Was there anything about the brand that emerged differently during the downturn than what you expected and any disappointment relative to your thoughts on the brand,DAL,0.7688591480255127,0.5377180205094936,Positive
Ill take the second question first. No I dont think so. One of the things that Ive been really impressed with the brand not only in terms of customers behavior and commitment to the brand and again a lot of the customers that were traveling were not our primary most are loyal customers. So that to me was the most important thing.,DAL,0.0743883252143859,-0.8512244529869875,Negative
So this was not a strongly loyal Delta base travelers. Its a business travelers or premium travelers. This was largely a price seekers that were  thatd have been out in the market for the last year and yet our brand still stood strong through that period.,DAL,0.2216622531414032,-0.556676421568645,Negative
One of the areas we also look as our cobrands spend with American Express. Our cobrands spend is held in total up really well as with Steve Squeri a few days ago. And I think on a yearoveryear basis were down less than 10 on a yearoveryear basis in terms of what Amex is seeing in terms of total cobrand spend on the Delta Card largely because of TE being down in such a material way.,DAL,0.21803018450737,-0.5639405631664771,Negative
If you look at the nonTE categories our cobrand spend is actually up. So as consumers are spending more theyre continuing to invest in the Delta brand using Amex. So I think holistically theres nothing about the brand Id say  as I stand back and say was disappointed.,DAL,0.0036481320858001,-0.9927049235730909,Negative
On the margins Gary is in the room. He can comment on the margins. Relative to the US margins Europe is closest. I think the US and the European margins or Europes not too far behind where we are in the US. Both Latin America and Asia were probably five to 10 points lower than domestic margins. Gary you can correct me if I misspoken that.,DAL,0.0638414025306701,-0.8723183109273381,Negative
No. You got it.,DAL,0.7716180682182312,0.5432358641838217,Positive
And as a followup on that well get to you eventually Mark I promise. But and this is probably for Glen on that international point. How should we think about future Latin American profitability post bankruptcy for LatAm and Aeromxico What does that mean for the JV and Deltas results in that region,DAL,0.9998449087142944,0.9996898172437056,Positive
Look it is not only in Latin America but all over the world. As Ed said earlier our international partners have not received the support from their respective governments the U.S. carriers have received from there. And that has led to a rash of bankruptcies and consolidations across the map.,DAL,0.8921884298324585,0.7843767311434335,Positive
And I think how we look at this is that our partners will emerge stronger and our ability to connect with our partners will  across the globe will allow us to have higher returns moving forward. And so what you seen is the weakest of the week have either restructured or gone away depending on the entity and will not be coming back with the amount of capacity or with the ferocious appetite for growth that they had in the past.,DAL,0.9030051231384276,0.8060101306498828,Positive
So I think whether youre looking at Latin or whether youre looking at TransAtlantic or even in the TransPacific were emerging from this in a very different position than we were going in. And as Ed said when you combine that with our fleet improvements internationally with the fleet renewal that weve been working on through the pandemic I think you can easily see where we can make significant improvements in every region with our partners and with our new fleet as we emerge from this. So very exciting time for us.,DAL,0.8081172704696655,0.6162343121971561,Positive
And picking up on that Glen you said the magic words fleet and as you touched on it a little bit too it was 11 months ago on the April call where Delta and the airline industry was at DEFCON 0 you sent a very strong message to Airbus and to investors that you werent taking any aircraft. And by the end of the year you were back talking about the great partnership that you have with Airbus on the fleet renewal and so forth.,DAL,0.9948403239250184,0.9896806416992199,Positive
So Im wondering that if we can do just a little postmortem on sort of the cadence if you will the thought process there on the fleet renewal versus where we were a year ago versus where we are now. How youre thinking about that and how youre thinking about ESG which I think is post pandemic obviously one of the biggest issues that were all facing as stakeholders here in the airline industry,DAL,0.9675337076187134,0.9350673765345672,Positive
Like I said not only Airbus but Boeing have been great partners over the course of this past year. And youre right in the throes of the virus I was looking at some numbers the other day that on April 4  now that our TSA count as an industry are back over 1 million a day and rising April 14 or so was about the low point which I think is when we had that earnings call in the first quarter. I think the TSA count for the industry was 87000 people its just stunning. So yes in the throes of that we suspended not just deliveries and payments of aircraft but just about everything that we could find.,DAL,0.9984135627746582,0.9968271236581348,Positive
But as weve worked through the course of the year we did a very good job of being able to retain our positions with Airbus we slid the book to the right by a couple of years as I think youre aware and maintain the commitments but thats what partners do. And weve worked creatively.,DAL,0.9969780445098876,0.9939560854173213,Positive
We continue to be taking the narrowbody aircraft fleet. We took over the  in the latter part of the year last year the 220300 launched a new fleet for us its doing well in the mix. And as we look forward a big big part of our recovery is they continue to upgauge with more domestic network which is going to be predicated on the Airbus 321s that we will continue to take as we eliminated many many of our  large number the 200 aircraft I talked about that retired over the last year were small domestic narrowbody smaller gauged aircraft.,DAL,0.7868152856826782,0.5736303172292216,Positive
So we continue to look opportunistically as to where there may be opportunities and some may be out there as orders have shifted from other carriers as well. When people ask me if were talking Airbus and Boeing we talked to those guys every single day. Good times and bad by the way.,DAL,0.9377987384796144,0.8755974028095026,Positive
And when we think about the carbon agenda and how you think about the environment. How does that fit in with fleet right now and have you  I mean prepandemic weve had some conversations about the old Delta the Old Northwest certainly right would run planes into the ground running forever and so forth. And there seem definitely to be a shift towards renewing the fleet even before we were in the pandemic. Obviously Im just sort of wondering right now on the carbon side how the fleet renewal fits in with that,DAL,0.9060283899307252,0.8120566678384948,Positive
Well it does. One of the silver linings of the pandemic was that we were able to retire many of those old airplanes that you that you referred to. In 2020 on a per seat basis our total fuel burn was down 6 on a yearoveryear basis over 2019. So thats a big number. And thats a number that we see entering 2021 because a lot of that burn was we received over the course of the latter parts of 2020.,DAL,0.2489038705825805,-0.5021931542117324,Negative
So historically weve been running about a 1.5 to 2 efficiency on a yearoveryear basis. We tripled that in 2020 and thats not due to lower volume thats just due to the actual seats that we were flying. And I see in 2021 us continuing to make good progress. I can see when we get towards the end of 2021 versus 2019 that number could be as high as 10 that we are  weve improved our fuel efficiency over this period of time.,DAL,0.2135314047336578,-0.5729381280768682,Negative
So those opportunities are real every plane that we take on the domestic narrowbody side whether its the 220s the 321s are coming in about 25 more fuel efficient than the plane that were retiring.,DAL,0.9075465202331544,0.8150929302531067,Positive
And just to clarify while youre right about 2020 as a whole if you look in the fourth quarter where the fleet restructuring had a more complete impact our fuel efficiency entre at some basis is up 11. We expect numbers like that to continue in the first and second quarter. So its having a big impact. Huge progress.,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Can we get a follow up,DAL,0.7761310338973999,0.5522618009220368,Positive
Yeah. So on the corporate demand question which is probably the biggest overhang at the moment I think it was on the fourth quarter call that you disclosed that half of your customers expect to get back to normal. I think it was 7 expect to never get back to normal and then something around level  the rest 43 sort of falling into that undecided category.,DAL,0.0179467499256134,-0.9641076708481734,Negative
Im curious what J.P. Morgans answer was to that question though I dont expect you to know it. Any updates to those numbers or how you think those numbers might be changing since the vaccine news was still sort of in its infancy when that poll was disclosed to The Street,DAL,0.8142478466033936,0.6284954717728328,Positive
Yes. We are updating that poll Jamie. So as we come out in midApril with our first quarter results about 30 days from now well give you the most recent guide. So were in the market talking to all of our big corporate customers.,DAL,0.9973230361938475,0.9946460691965036,Positive
What I think were going to say is that the intensive travel is continuing to move forward. Weve seen since the start of the year intensive travelers up about 10 points on the backs of the improvement in the containment of the virus vaccinations continue to move the fact that the country become more people vaccinated than actually have having actually had positive diagnosis of the virus is an important data point.,DAL,0.978195309638977,0.9563905932847221,Positive
And companies are starting to see their signs for is how theyre reopening their businesses and starting to get back to whatever the new  the next normal is as we look forward to. I think the numbers will be better than that. That 43 will have more insight. And certainly all the indications were seeing and not just the big businesses certainly the small businesses were starting to see real growth and the share that weve garnered during this last year were holding.,DAL,0.9700329303741456,0.9400658250247391,Positive
Q  Jamie Baker,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And were approaching our hard stop but we can run a minute or two over given the difficulties we had at the beginning of the session gentlemen again apologies on behalf of JPMorgan for that.,DAL,0.1294423639774322,-0.7411163098313271,Negative
Ed weve discussed  youve discussed at our event in the past develop the various modes that exists around your business have any new modes emerged have any existing modes grown less shallow more deep Or should we just think about no change in that regard So when do you think the narrative shifts back to Delta as a high quality industrial transport,DAL,0.766929566860199,0.5338588558786248,Positive
Well I think the most will have proven their strength and their durability the resilience over the course pandemic as we get old get a little bit further ahead of this as we get into the spring and summer and see what the recovery actually materializes and how it looks. But we know the strength of our hub network is powerful. And were seeing that already play out. We know the strength of our brand we talk about is powerful. We know the strength of our people has been powerful.,DAL,0.9999399185180664,0.9998798369645101,Positive
Generally one of the things that we talked a lot about in those modes is culture. The culture of our company the culture of our people and while our net promoter scores and our brand scores are at all time highs for various reasons I think that the most important reason is the great work our team has done taking care of people pulling anxiety as they get through the travel experience smiling with your eyes through a mask. I mean its the experiences is really unique about Delta and has never been better.,DAL,0.9999984502792358,0.9999969005566243,Positive
And were going to do our best to hold on to that as we proceed through the course of this one quick stat indeed the hiring company that is known for rating employers by anonymous employees surveys rated Delta just recently the seventh best employer in the country amongst the large employers as rated by our own employees.,DAL,0.9892368316650392,0.9784736504993743,Positive
So we talked about strength and culture and brand health and employee health is amazing going through a pandemic and were rated the seventh best employer amongst large employers. So real proud of that. Probably the only part of the multi indiscernible is the balance sheet. But the fact that we were able to get through this crisis without diluting our shareholders uniquely again I think is a real mode and theres something that were going to reclaim.,DAL,0.9771161079406738,0.9542321886016063,Positive
Q  Jamie Baker,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
On the workforce do you think the downturn has altered the collective view towards profit sharing given that Delta was somewhat of an outlier on that input or output I suppose,DAL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
No I think its reinforced the drive by the team. They missed those jets back last month and the focus upon getting this company back on its feet is so powerful. Its so strong. So no I think its going to play out even stronger as we go forward.,DAL,0.0753287672996521,-0.84934356769536,Negative
All right thats excellent. Just checking nobody has pinged me with any additional questions. So ladies and gentlemen thats the oneonones enjoy the rest of the day. Thanks for the session. And I think I can promise that we will be getting together for this event next year and hopefully a lot sooner than that. But thanks for putting up with the clunky format. We really appreciate it.,DAL,0.9999991059303284,0.9999982118595909,Positive
Thank you Jamie. Mark we look forward to being in person.,DAL,0.9728900194168092,0.9457800065159838,Positive
Thank you. Take care.,DAL,0.9956488609313964,0.9912977166758277,Positive

I will now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe.,NKE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Andy and hello to everyone on todays call. First and foremost like all companies around the world were pleased by the recent positive news of the vaccine rollout. We remain optimistic though were prepared to operate through continued volatility until the virus is fully contained. Our teams have proven their agility to operate through uncertainty while also staying focused on the long term and we once again demonstrated that agility in Q3. Its why I wouldnt trade our position with anyone. The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Throughout the pandemic we have stayed focused on our unique advantages and weve been resolute in fueling innovation and our brand is as strong as ever.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
I am proud of our results this quarter. Q3 saw us continue to deliver consumers new products new campaigns the energy from our roster of athletes and more. Our strategy puts the member at the center and keeps us in the lead and we will continue to drive even further competitive separation. And still we push our own expectations of ourselves. Last week we released our 2020 Impact Report and announced our new 2025 Purpose Targets. Our new 5year purpose targets offer a road map to 2025 outlining clear goals action plans and accountability. And for the first time that accountability now includes linking executive compensation to our Purpose Goals.,NKE,0.999996781349182,0.9999935626945271,Positive
Our 2025 targets will keep us focused on accelerating our efforts against a wide range of priorities from sustainability to representation to investing in the future of sport in communities around the world. I encourage everyone to take a look at the report at purpose.nike.com. Ultimately this isnt just the right thing to do it makes great business sense. Setting purpose targets for ourselves creates longterm value raises the bar for our industry and redefines our own potential for a positive impact in the world. Our commitment to constant improvement is why I continue to be so amazed by this team. I have never been more confident in our leadership and teams around the world as we stay on the offense accelerating our longterm strategy. And as I said this continues to be a dynamic external environment but I am proud how adaptable NIKE is. No matter what happens COVID spikes forced enclosed  store closures port congestion on the West Coast and more this team responds with solutions. We adjust and we win.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
Our brand continues to deeply connect all over the world. We remain consumers number one favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in both mens and womens businesses. Were also seeing particularly strong connections in Greater China where our strong portfolio of brands including Jordan and Converse is helping to extend our leadership position. All over the world the relationships we have with consumers cannot easily be replicated. Our brand differentiates us driven by the unique competitive advantages that we enjoy.,NKE,0.9993786811828612,0.9987573616250522,Positive
First NIKEs connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. Our roster of athletes is the greatest in the world. Naomi Osaka continues to emerge as a truly global sport icon having won 4 Grand Slam titles at only 23 years old. Kylian Mbapp became the youngest footballer ever to score 25 Champions League goals leading Paris SaintGermain into the quarterfinals. The NBA AllStar Game has proved yet again of our dominance in basketball with Lebrons team taking on KDs Giannis winning MVP and a young core of Jordan Brand superstars led by Zion and Luka. And the energy of March Madness tips off today with Jordan and NIKE schools making up 10 of the top 16 womens teams and 15 of the top 16 mens teams. No brand connects with consumers with the power and culture of sport like NIKE and we pride ourselves on our leadership role to drive hope and inspiration all over the world.,NKE,0.99757182598114,0.9951436490676693,Positive
Second our brand is powered by our global scale. This is particularly critical advantage as we continue to fuel our digital transformation. Weve had tremendous success in digital quickly pivoting to serve consumers as they shift to digital channels. But even as this consumer shift is felt across industries NIKEs digital transformation remains a unique advantage. Scale matters. The strength of our brand allows us to stay personal at scale with consumers in all of our geographies. And more than ever the portfolio effect of being a truly global brand is powerful.,NKE,0.9978280067443848,0.9956560108995502,Positive
Third we stay at the front of the pack thanks to our compelling consumer experiences. Last quarter we announced the launch of SNKRS Live our first product drop via live streaming. In Q3 we doubled the number of countries with live streaming adding Japan Germany and Italy. Were seeing phenomenal engagement for this live interaction with average viewing duration doubling to over 15 minutes I wish it were 15 years well above the industry norms. Were also creating content to connect members to the sport and sneaker community content that drives the highest engagement on sneakers. So whether its through the SNKRS App our Activity apps platforms like TikTok and more we continue to find compelling ways to deliver an authentic NIKE experience in digital.,NKE,0.999915599822998,0.9998311995453832,Positive
And fourth the Jordan Brand had a very strong quarter growing double digits in Q3. This growth was broadbased led by our biggest growth opportunities digital international apparel and womens. In fact Jordans womens business was up nearly triple digits a strong statement of how the brand continues to serve a broader set of consumers. Q3 also saw the launch of the Air Jordan 11 Jubilee one of the largest and most successful footwear launches ever with more than 175 million in revenue. We are incredibly confident about the continued growth opportunity for the Jordan Brand moving forward.,NKE,0.9852396249771118,0.970479232358475,Positive
As always our brand is propelled by our unmatched innovation investment and pipeline. Innovations at our core reflecting not just our foundational values but the values we share with consumers. We dont just innovate for the elite athlete we use innovation and design to solve problems for all consumers no matter their sport or style of play. And we consistently bring fresh new product to market supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. At the core of our innovation engine is our edge in performance. And we continue to use this edge to evolve some of the most popular products for everyday runners.,NKE,0.9999322891235352,0.9998645781663527,Positive
This quarter we focused on a key problem for runners with new footwear that continues our mission to unlock injury prevention. The ZoomX Invincible Run offers a brandnew look for Nike Running with increased foam in the midsole. This creates a soft ride that makes running feel easy with incredible energy return and is designed to help reduce runningrelated injuries. We also just launched the React Escape a shoe specifically designed for the female runner. The React Escapes silhouette materials and design details are all aimed at new runners and its seeing great sellthrough as it encourages more women to pick up the sport.,NKE,0.9998594522476196,0.9997189043276933,Positive
We are also driving our sustainability agenda through strong product innovation. Weve set ambitious goals around the use of sustainable materials throughout our line and well continue to invest in new materials and methods of make to maintain our leadership position here. Last month we launched Cosmic Unity our first performance shoe under Our Move to Zero initiative. This initiative which moves us towards zero waste and zero carbon embraces circular design as a guiding principle. Cosmic Unity which has also been already been worn on court by some of the NBAs best including Anthony Davis is NIKEs first performance shoe made out of at least 25 recycled content by weight and offers just a hint of our future with sustainable product. We are also resolute in our pursuit of making sport a daily habit for all athletes. A great example of this work is the Nike Go FlyEase. Its easyon easyoff design solves for an ambitious North Star the creation of a truly handsfree shoe. This is a shoe for everyone from elite athletes to parents with their hands full. Were initially launching Nike Go FlyEase first for our most engaged members with broader consumer availability coming later this year. And we continue to push our industry in creating product through better consumer insights.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
This quarter we acquired Datalogue a data integration platform that will help us process analyze and act on the data we enjoy thanks to our scale advantage. This lets us harness the full power of our data turning it into more actionable insights and enabling greater speed. As part of our recent organizational realignment we also put our data teams alongside the creative teams to unlock this opportunity. NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation and the move towards deeper and more dynamic insights along with our talent and investments in data science and machine learning creates a capacity that no other brand has.,NKE,0.9761701226234436,0.9523402168394428,Positive
Lets quickly talk about the Tokyo Olympics and Para Olympics. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding the games we look forward to leveraging that world stage to showcase our innovation and purpose commitments. Our pipeline and cadence has continued its pace including some new innovations and the scaling of a few of our recent innovation platforms. This summer in Tokyo we look forward to sharing the nextgeneration of FlyEase and its mission of inclusive innovation as well as delivering some new and exciting womenspecific innovations.,NKE,0.9999977350234984,0.9999954700442968,Positive
The last thing Id like to discuss is digital. Were taking even greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as we create the future of retail. We know that our consumers want a consistent seamless and premium experience. And so alongside our strategic partners we continue to consolidate the marketplace to give our consumers that premium experience. Our owned digital business is thriving with growth of 54 on a currencyneutral basis during the quarter. This growth was led by North America which had its firstever quarter with 1 billion in digital revenue.,NKE,0.999961256980896,0.9999225139156067,Positive
As you know we set a bold vision for digital across owned and operated and partnered being 50 of our business in the long term. We have made significant progress to date increasing the digital mix of our business by more than 10 points in Q3 versus the prior year. NIKEs ability to sustainably grow digital for the longterm is rooted in our member connections and compelling experiences that only NIKE can offer. And our members are more engaged than ever with an over 60 increase in monthly engaged users for the quarter led by our SNKRS App where were seeing 4x the engagement in monthly active users versus last year. This heightened engagement is translating into buying. Were seeing continued member growth outpace total digital growth as buying members increased 80 versus the prior year. And these connections extend beyond digital. In our own stores member demand penetration rates are seeing meaningful increases enabled by robust store training programs memberspecific promotions and enhanced account linking capabilities. This is critical as we strategically focus on better serving and driving repeat engagement with active highvalue members across all of our channels.,NKE,0.99998539686203,0.9999707937066518,Positive
In the end NIKE is staying on offense and we are focused on extending our leadership position. We have a proven playbook led by digital and everything weve seen makes us more confident in our future. Our focus is on the longterm and we are not slowing down.,NKE,0.9993298649787904,0.9986597291587171,Positive
And with that I will turn the call over to Matt.,NKE,0.8319525718688965,0.6639049434095283,Positive
Thank you John and hello to everyone on the call. As we have entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemicrelated challenges our focus has not wavered. We continue to position NIKE to win today and over the long term. We are now 1 year into managing through these dynamics and we have met every hurdle with leadership and decisive action. While we are optimistic about the pace of vaccine distribution and how this will enable safe reopening of the global economy in the near future the effects of the virus continue to create shortterm volatility in our business performance. For example in Q3 disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages transportation delays and port congestion has interrupted the flow of inventory supply. The result has been supply shortages relative to continued strong marketplace demand.,NKE,0.9776958227157592,0.9553916188428513,Positive
In North America specifically inventory supply was delayed by more than 3 weeks impacting the timing of wholesale shipments and growth in the quarter. In EMEA additional COVIDrelated lockdowns caused a higher number of physical retail stores to be closed andor operate on reduced hours versus the prior quarter. But our operating priorities remain unchanged and were focused on what we can control optimize marketplace supply and demand with speed and agility accelerate the pace of direct connections with consumers and exert our financial strength to move faster towards our longterm strategic vision of the consumer direct acceleration. I am proud of how our teams continue to respond demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. And our results reflect our teams unwavering commitment to serving our consumers. John couldnt have said it any better we adjust and we win. This is the mentality that will propel us forward as we focus on the future.,NKE,0.9998731017112732,0.9997462032712718,Positive
Now as I reflect on the third quarter I want to highlight two important points. First NIKEs brand momentum is as strong as ever and we are driving focused growth in our largest opportunities. Our innovation and product franchises are resonating with consumers. This translated into doubledigit retail sales growth over the holiday season. We drove a higher proportion of fullprice sales with lower markdown activity and this retail momentum has continued into the spring season.,NKE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
At our core NIKE is a growth company. And we delivered another strong quarter of performance against our largest longterm growth opportunities. Greater China set the pace for our geographies growing revenue 42 on a currencyneutral basis. We set another record for Chinese New Year with digital demand doubling versus fiscal 19. NIKE Digital grew 54 led by strong growth across our mobile app ecosystem. Demand on the NIKE App grew 90 versus the prior year. Womens drove overindexing revenue growth for the quarter including nearly 90 growth in NIKE Digital. And with high doubledigit retail sales growth across the marketplace we are increasing NIKEs market share across our key markets. And last the Jordan Brand grew 15 delivering its third consecutive quarter of doubledigit growth with incredible brand momentum and a clear formula of growth for the future. We are exceeding prepandemic levels of business and our brand momentum is clear. From our relentless flow of new product and storytelling to our deep consumer connections our extensive portfolio of athletes and teams and the scale of our digital platforms NIKE is positioned to drive highquality sustainable and profitable growth across our portfolio.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
Second this quarter demonstrated how a more direct digitally enabled NIKE will fuel longterm strategic and financial value. Our consumer direct acceleration strategy is driving a meaningful and broader marketplace shift and it is transforming our financial model. Our own digital business has grown more than 70 yeartodate and our mix of owned and partner digital now exceeds 35 of our total business. This quarter we increased member buying frequency and grew retained buying members versus the prior year and the prior quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal 22 and beyond we expect digital to continue to be our fastestgrowing marketplace channel with digital mix increasing towards our 50 vision.,NKE,0.2184363007545471,-0.5631283301879944,Negative
NIKE physical stores are another key enabler to drive our consumer direct acceleration. And our monobrand store expansion strategy creates an incremental market opportunity for NIKE. New retail concepts such as Live Rise and Unite will create distinctive authentic and premium NIKE consumer experiences in the marketplace. They will accelerate NIKE member acquisition at scale while unlocking higher retail productivity. They will recapture displaced consumer demand as we restructure the wholesale marketplace with our strategic partners. And most importantly they will accelerate NIKE Digital growth by scaling online to offline capabilities as our physical presence reaches a greater number of consumers. A great example of this are the 2 new Nike Live concepts we opened in Greater China this quarter where member checkout rates reached 90 paving the way for connected member journeys and memberled digital growth. We look forward to scaling these new retail concepts into fiscal 22.,NKE,0.9988410472869872,0.9976820931923942,Positive
As Ive said before this strategic shift to increasingly direct and personalized connections with consumers unlock strategic and financial opportunity for NIKE. This quarter NIKE Direct gross margins contributed to our overall gross margin expansion of 130 basis points being fueled by a higher mix of digital which carries a higher gross margin rate as well as optimization of new pricing capabilities using advanced analytics in North America. We are also continuing to test and learn within our full funnel digital marketing activities and our pace of learning is accelerating with so much opportunity ahead.,NKE,0.9918298721313475,0.9836597345231379,Positive
During Q3 in North America we leveraged data to identify consumer cohorts and feature personalized product recommendations to members to both activate members who have never purchased and increase repeat purchasing. We expect Datalogue to amplify our speed in analyzing consumer data and inform product marketing and service recommendations ultimately increasing member buying frequency basket size and member retention rates. It is clear that our shift to a more direct membercentric business is beginning to drive strategic and financial value for NIKE and we are confident we are making the right investments in the areas that matter most.,NKE,0.9953655004501344,0.9907309953755115,Positive
Now lets turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE Inc. revenue grew 3 in Q3 declining 1 on a currencyneutral basis as NIKE Direct grew 16 led by strong NIKE Digital growth offset by declines in our wholesale business due to the timing of wholesale shipments caused by global supply chain challenges in North America and mandatory store closures in EMEA. Gross margin increased 130 basis points versus the prior year resulting from higher full price product margins due in part to geography mix and favorable NIKE Digital mix partially offset by lower NIKE Direct rate as we continue to manage inventory levels due to COVID19 as well as foreign exchange headwinds.,NKE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
SGA declined 7 in the quarter as we shifted certain demand creation initiatives to better align our investments with product delivery time lines and market conditions along with lower operating overhead due primarily to lower wage related costs versus the prior year and continued expense management. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.4 compared to 3.9 for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items and a shift in earnings mix in part due to the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was 0.90 up 70 versus the prior year. As a reminder prior year EPS included a 0.25 noncash FXrelated charge associated with the planned transition to a strategic distributor model in South America.,NKE,0.9396549463272096,0.8793098207174666,Positive
With that lets turn to our operating segments. In North America Q3 revenue declined 11 on a currencyneutral basis and EBIT increased 4 on a reported basis. We saw strong retail sales growth over the holiday season and drove clean marketplace inventory due to our first half supply and demand management actions. However starting in late December container shortages and West Coast port congestion began to increase the transit times of inventory supply by more than 3 weeks. The result was a lack of available supply delayed shipments to wholesale partners and lowerthanexpected quarterly revenue growth. We expect to capture this delayed revenue in the fourth quarter. NIKE Direct however grew 15 on a currencyneutral basis led by NIKE Digital growth of more than 50 and we have seen this momentum continue into March.,NKE,0.0480007827281951,-0.9039995694157896,Negative
This quarter we accelerated analytics capabilities to dynamically adjust pricing and fulfillment alternatives as we balance consumer demand inventory availability and profitability. We also prioritized available product supply to NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. Inventory in North America grew 31 versus the prior year. We had extraordinarily high levels of intransit inventory due to increased transit times. Inventory units in our distribution centers declined nearly 20. With strong consumer demand continuing through the spring season and marketplace inventory down high double digits versus the prior year we expect continued full price momentum despite the shortterm supply disruption and elevated levels of intransit inventory related to ongoing global supply chain dynamics.,NKE,0.860053300857544,0.7201064348855226,Positive
In EMEA Q3 revenue declined 9 on a currencyneutral basis and EBIT declined 7 on a reported basis. Across most countries in Western Europe government restrictions caused an acceleration of store closures with approximately 45 of our NIKEowned stores closed over the last 2 months of the quarter. We have leveraged our supply and demand playbook and specifically Express Lane to recalibrate marketplace inventory. Excess inventory in EMEA is manageable and lower than during the first wave of lockdowns. Assuming lockdown restrictions begin to ease by midApril we expect EMEA inventory to be normalized in the first quarter of fiscal 22.,NKE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
As of today approximately 35 of our NIKEowned stores are closed and this situation continues to be dynamic. But in markets where our stores have reopened we are seeing strong consumer response and continued brand momentum with higher conversion rates and strong comp sales growth yearoveryear complementing strong digital growth. With NIKEowned and partner stores mostly closed we leveraged the strength of our NIKE Digital business which grew 60 on a currencyneutral basis led by the NIKE App which grew triple digits in the quarter and NIKE Digital demand has continued to grow triple digits in March.,NKE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
With that lets turn to Greater China which achieved its second consecutive 2 billion quarter and grew 42 on a currencyneutral basis with EBIT growth of 75 on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 52 versus the prior year with more than 40 growth in digital and nearly 60 growth in NIKEowned stores as the retail market largely returned to normal including strong doubledigit growth in partner retail stores widening our market lead as the favorite brand with consumers. As I mentioned earlier Chinese New Year was a key highlight and through our Express Lane offense we created and delivered hyperlocal products to celebrate the moment including the Dunk Low and the womens Dunk Disrupt which both instantly sold out. Our womens business grew more than 60 versus the prior year and our 2 new Nike Live stores are resonating deeply with her since opening. In digital we focused on engaging and serving members across multiple platforms including live stream and social media. During Chinese New Year we doubled our number of highvalue members. We also  while also increasing member retention. Were excited by the opportunity we see ahead and so we are accelerating investment in Greater China including in the local consumer digital experience new retail concepts and omnichannel integration with our owned and partner stores.,NKE,0.9984453320503236,0.9968906622473375,Positive
Finally in our APLA geography Q3 revenue declined 8 on a currencyneutral basis and was temporarily impacted by the transition of our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model partially offset by continued strength in South Korea and Pacific. And Q3 EBIT grew 5 versus the prior year on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew nearly 70 on a currencyneutral basis and we focused on member engagement and the scaling of consumer services like member days. In Japan we drove record weeks of member buying launched our interactive live streaming on SNKRS and activated new O2O capabilities. In Mexico we more than doubled our digital growth and we plan to launch the NIKE mobile app in the first half of fiscal 22.,NKE,0.8569085001945496,0.7138168298106371,Positive
I will now turn to our financial outlook. This past year has been one of the most dynamic operating environments in our history and Q3 was no exception. Despite these continued challenges we remain focused on serving the consumer while making clear operating decisions with speed and agility. We can see the nearterm operating environment with increasing clarity yet we remain focused on whats required to win for the long term. With that in mind we are now more confident in our full year outlook for revenue and expect low to midteens growth versus the prior year.,NKE,0.9949909448623656,0.9899818837534686,Positive
Specifically for Q4 in our least comparable quarter of the fiscal year we expect revenue growth of roughly 75 versus the prior year. This reflects governmentmandated restrictions in Europe starting to ease in April and inventory transit times slowly improving in North America. We now expect gross margin to expand up to 75 basis points versus the prior year reflecting the continued shifts weve seen to our more profitable NIKE Direct business partially offset by higher logistics and freight costs and higher markdowns to liquidate excess inventory in EMEA. Foreign exchange is now estimated to be a roughly 35 basis point headwind on the full year.,NKE,0.0385988652706146,-0.9228034155389163,Negative
We expect SGA dollars will be slightly up versus the prior year as we rebuild investment levels and demand creation towards prepandemic levels and continue to invest to accelerate the pace of our digital transformation. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to midteens for the full year. And finally we will resume moderate levels of share repurchase beginning in the fourth quarter. We are confident in our outlook for strong free cash flow growth which enables us to accelerate capital returns while making the necessary investments to enable our consumer direct acceleration.,NKE,0.9915811419487,0.983162273861333,Positive
Looking ahead to fiscal 22 as I said earlier we are already exceeding our prepandemic levels of business. And I expect the momentum we are seeing to translate into continued strong revenue growth. I will provide more specific guidance for fiscal 22 on our next earnings call. As a growth company our offense is working. NIKEs brand momentum is as strong as ever. Our product is resonating the pipeline is strong and our brands are more deeply connected to consumers than ever before. The pace of our digital transformation is also accelerating and we are investing against the large market opportunity we see. We are converting more consumers into members and connecting more deeply more frequently and more meaningfully via our digital platforms and ultimately also through our One Nike Marketplace strategic partners. My optimism for NIKEs longterm potential has never been higher.,NKE,0.9977803230285645,0.9955606434110662,Positive

I guess I was wondering on the inventory I think the delayed flow of inventory you talked about your confidence in essentially just moving everything into the fourth quarter. Just  can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of  will that be largely into the wholesale where you sort of missed some of the sales Are you going to move it to more the apps or the online the SNKRS App or Nike.com app Just could you give us a little more color around the plans to move that inventory in the fourth quarter Thanks.,NKE,0.0094661116600036,-0.9810689574891077,Negative
Sure. Well as I mentioned we saw an extension of transit times of inventory by up to 3 weeks. And what that means is that across the marketplace we were anticipating to have more available supply in the third quarter than ultimately what we were able to have to satisfy demand across both the direct side of the business and across our wholesale partners. Weve now effectively absorbed the longer lead times through our third quarter. And so we do expect a more consistent flow of inventory in the fourth quarter recognizing that transit times are elevated versus the prior year but we expect a more consistent flow of inventory from here. I mentioned Bob in my prepared remarks that we continue to see strong demand across the marketplace. And were seeing stronger demand. We continue to see stronger demand in differentiated retail which is our strategic partners than were seeing an undifferentiated retail. And so we will continue to prioritize inventory for our strategic partners and for NIKE Direct. And when we look at where marketplace inventory is today its down high double digits versus where it was a year ago. And so there is strong demand for that inventory across our strategic partners and NIKE Direct and we continue to  we intend to continue to fulfill that demand in both of those locations.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
Great great. And if I could just ask a followup question the  so I recently had a chance to rewatch The Last Dance. And I think the original budget for the Jordans in  was that what 4 million or 3 million in year 4 they did 126 million in year 1. I was wondering if you could tell us who was responsible for the budget that year And maybe if you could just give us a little bit more flavor on how different your forecasting is these days I think that might be of interest.,NKE,0.9998425245285034,0.9996850488692812,Positive

Hey guys. Thanks for taking our questions and Matt I wanted to ask you I think you just said that you raised the revenue growth rate for the year. Obviously that helps add a lot of confidence to your ability to unlock some of that inventory. But I think you previously described that the SGA for the year at up low singles and now youre saying up slightly while youre raising revenue growth. But you did say there was some reinvestment in demand creation there too. So Im trying to put the  just at a high level the picture together. It seems like there is either much more efficient demand creation going on that we can think about as the model kind of builds back post COVID longer term or better leverage on the operating overhead expense line. Maybe you could just help us think about why the SGA is able to stay at a fairly manageable level there while you keep raising the revenue line,NKE,0.999976634979248,0.9999532699306428,Positive
Sure. Well I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look yearoveryear. The comparisons arent going to be linear as compared to where weve been in prior quarters nor will they be intuitive. But when I talk about investment levels I need to start with the core principle which is NIKE is a growth company. And so as we continue to see the market opportunity in front of us we are poised and in this position of strength to be able to accelerate investment against the things that are most critical in order to enable and drive our consumer direct acceleration strategy. Now in the middle of COVID we got extremely focused on what matters most. And we reallocated resources and tightly  and from a disciplined perspective managed our expenses so that we could continue investing against the things that matter most to our strategy like our tech  endtoend tech transformation digitizing our supply chain and ultimately investing in the marketplace. And so weve continued to do that while weve been able to manage other expenses more tightly as a result of the environment were in.,NKE,0.9901372790336608,0.9802745463100349,Positive
As we start to look at coming out of the pandemic we dont intend to just add it back in okay Every dollar were putting back in we know is going to create or we have a plan to create a return on it. And so were taking advantage of the moment to be able to do that and we will continue to accelerate investment against those levels. But to your point historically prior to COVID we were at about 33 of revenue in terms of our SGA levels and weve been able to manage through the last  the first three quarters of this year closer to 29. And demand creation has been a source of leverage over this period the reduction in sport activity in the first half of this year as well as some work that we did to sharpen certain areas of historical marketing investment. And as a result of that demand creation investment was driving some leverage for us. Prior to COVID we were at something like 9 or 10 of revenue and it fell to about 7 in the first half. But what I mentioned on the last earnings call is that we dont think these are sustainable levels for demand creation as we look forward. And so given the speed of our recovery in the first half our plan was to start accelerating investment back towards prepandemic levels. We wont get there in one quarter. We will get there over a period of time but we believe that thats the right thing to do from a position of strength and given the size and scale of our brand and our recovery.,NKE,0.0224304497241973,-0.9551402659060158,Negative
So we had planned to spend more in the third quarter. But when we started to see the supply chain shifts occurring we decided to shift some of that marketing investment into the fourth quarter in order to be able to balance and have those marketing investments occur at the time that the product was available in the marketplace. Were going to be accelerating investment in Q4 against our biggest growth opportunities. Womens were going to continue to be investing internationally as I mentioned against  were going to be investing behind Jordan. And we are going to continue to invest against digital. But we do believe longer term Michael that digital will be a source of leverage for us as we drive a greater return on ad spend and see more effectiveness in our full funnel marketing. And so that will be a source of leverage over time.,NKE,0.9888321161270142,0.9776642189408653,Positive
Okay. Thanks for that. And then John if I could ask one followup you speak about the physical store strategy globally. It sounds like there is a lot of new interesting concepts. And I guess in North America a market that grew up long ago is more of a wholesale model and youve made the biggest effort to transform the marketplace there. If the  Im curious how you see the segmentation effort as a lot of undifferentiated retailers come out of your business but you still do have strategic partners through  with stores through the U.S. In the past weve seen you segment by House of Hoops Track Club the big installations at Dicks Sporting Goods those kinds of things. How do you think about the next round of segmenting the market when if youre going to be bringing more NIKE brand stores into the market now in a backdrop that has some of those wholesale partners still out there that are generating good business,NKE,0.9999610781669616,0.9999221562875247,Positive
Well Michael we start with the consumer we start in every case with the consumer and the consumer is really clear that they want to get what they want when they want it how they want it. And they want a seamless premium digital and physical experience. In fact in many cases they dont see a difference between digital and physical whether they bought it on digitally and had it delivered at home or whether they bought it digitally and picked it up in store whether it was one of our stores or one of our strategic partner stores. And so we do see a need and a really important role for strategic physical presence both ours and our partners. And the way well go forward is we are driving starting with our own digital and our own stores the seamless premium experience thats centered on the member where we know who the member is. That member expects us to know who they are whether they are in our stores or our partner stores. And so well work with a smaller number of strategic partners that see the same future we do and that want to and are willing to share membership data so that we can together deliver a very seamless experience a very personalized experience for consumers. And the whole One Nike Marketplace will allow us to help consumers to get what they want when they want it how they want it. And so as we segment its  were leaning in with those partners that see the world the same way we do. And those are the ones and the good news is they do. And the good news is those are the partners that have the most robust business with our shared consumers today. So the consolidation will continue. And again I think youll see even more movement from undifferentiated retail into a smaller number of  a smaller number of partners and our own stores that provide that seamless premium experience.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive

Great thanks. Good afternoon. John for you I was hoping you could speak a little bit more about the strength youve seen in China maybe a little bit on the consumer behavior as well as the product trends as that economy has picked up. Is there anything that youre looking or that you can learn from what youre seeing there for the rest of the world as we all open up And then Matt just for you a clarification would you be able to quantify kind of what you think the port miss was on North American segment in the quarter Thank you.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
Well Erinn on China its just really clear and its sort of interesting. Im on my I guess 14 month but I so distinctly remember and fondly recall my first week at NIKE was in China as you recall on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing seeing the incredible connection that the Chinese consumer has with the NIKE Jordan and Converse brands and frankly seeing really highquality physical retail to my prior  to the prior question prior answer. The merchandising  these are all monobrand stores as you know with us our direct ones and our partners. And when you see what a outstanding physical merchandise experience can be and link that to a seamless digital experience its quite powerful. And were probably furthest along in the world on that in China. And I will say that our Chinese team has just done a fabulous job in the past year of not just building a great business but showing the way for other parts of the company. They obviously have done that through the pandemic being constantly 3 to 6 months ahead. Including today being back at work sidebyside and the energy that comes with that including today having physical retail open and seeing traffic getting close to historical levels. But they are also leading on that seamless experience. An example Ill highlight is just the one I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks on our new doors there they are getting 70 80 90 of consumers in physical doors to either identify themselves as members or sign up and become members. And that allows that seamless experience for a consumer. So they are not  they are completely indifferent about whether they buy it have it shipped to home buy it online and pick it up in the store whether within the store and they buy it and have it shipped home. And so I think that strong connection we have with consumers brandwise but also that when we talk about the consistent premium seamless experience online to offline that deliver consumers were furthest along. Were furthest along in China and I give that team huge credit and were rapidly following that in our other geographies and regions.,NKE,0.9999998807907104,0.9999997615812788,Positive
Id maybe just jump in and say on the China piece that we continue to scale the Express Lane in China. And I referenced a couple of examples in the quarter related to Chinese New Year specific product. But we doubled the Express Lane in the quarter and it continues to have significant impact not only on localizing product but also  localizing product but also speed and agility in the marketplace through our fulfillment models. And then Erinn maybe one other indication visvis China being ahead of other places as the world has opened up sport is returning. And so just the energy that were seeing with sport returning were seeing our Performance business continue to grow significantly as well as our Kids business in that market and it gives us a lot of optimism as were looking ahead to reopening occurring in North America Europe and other places. Specifically on your question about North America what I would just say is we were on track to deliver our internal plans and we were seeing momentum that was consistent with the type of momentum that weve been seeing yeartodate as we are shifting creating the marketplace shifts and continuing to lead with NIKE Direct and our strategic partners.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
Our next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.,NKE,0.9214060306549072,0.842811967618446,Positive
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hey John I wanted to followup on an interesting comment you made about merging art and science. And when you were talking about putting the data people alongside the creative people maybe you could dive into that a little bit more. What your vision is and what areas are you applying data Is it just customer analytics or is it in design and marketing and other areas Wed be really curious to see how youre doing that. And then my followup question is around womens. It kind of seems like a recurring theme. You guys are doing really well in a lot of areas in the womens business. What are the key drivers Whats the difference from the past NIKE has been focused on womens a long time but it seems to be inflecting. And maybe if you could update us on where womens is in the mix and how big that maybe that could be over time Thanks.,NKE,0.99998676776886,0.9999735355219459,Positive
Great Omar. And Matt why dont I take a cut of these and you can fill in. On  Omar on data data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain. Now the most obvious place is at the consumerfacing front right So even in this quarter we saw use of data to deliver more targeted communications to consumers and more personalized experience. And I would say relative to whats possible were just scratching the surface there. So on that sort of consumerfacing side data played a really  has played an important role and will continue to play an important role. The second area it plays an important role is one part of the consumer experience was getting the right product in the right place at the right time. And so this is where our select acquisition has allowed us to fairly impressively pivot to a more directtoconsumer supply chain. And I again give our supply chain team enormous credit for what they have done over the last year as we have pivoted toward digital. But what thats all about is knowing what inventory to have resident in local regional warehouses so that you can get delivered more rapidly and often through ground transportation. By the way both of those are scale games. The more data you have if youre the leader and you have more scale it allows you to deliver better experiences and have better efficiency. And as you described data will ultimately also be able to help us do better design and create better products. Some of the people that are most excited in the company about what data and technology can do are John Hoke our  who runs design and Phil McCartney and Aaron Heiser who run footwear and apparel. They are like with the data that we now have from our digital sites and that we can get from our consumer insights group it just means that we can design footwear and apparel thats even more focused and more targeted on what the consumer wants.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
And so Id say were into our data journey but there is so much more opportunity to come. And I think the entire company sees it and is excited about it. With respect to womens the womens business is having a great momentum. It was the  I think eighth straight quarter where womens growth out indexed overall growth. And thats across both NIKE and Jordan Brand. And that had 86 growth in NIKE Digital. And physical retail marketplace retail grew to high double digits and were gaining share in womens both on footwear and apparel. And while were seeing success in womens to date this move toward the consumer construct that weve described with a real dedicated and focused womens team means that we can increase our investment. So weve doubled our investment in womens innovation over the past year and that extends endtoend. And so a wonderful example of what that can produce is what I referred to earlier this React Escape. Because we launched it this quarter this running shoe takes into account the physiological differences between male and female bodies. And so its silhouette its materials its design details are all aimed at the new female runner. And we think its just a wonderful example of how we can take sharper insights and a greater focus endtoend across our organization to really continue to turbocharge our womens business.,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
I would just add that some of the comments John made earlier as well just about our store strategy the Nike Live concept is a is a concept thats intended to unlock significant growth in the womens marketplace. And we just  it would be hard Omar to size the opportunity because the womens market is so large. And we see the opportunity relative to where our business is penetrated today. And so while we continue to take share those definitions are within the refinement of the way people define the market from an athletic footwear and athletic apparel in this. But what were also seeing is athletic taking share of the broader womens marketplace. And so those are going to be fuel for growth for us as we continue to invest behind this exciting opportunity.,NKE,0.9999997615814208,0.9999995231625574,Positive
Operator we have time for one more question.,NKE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our last question comes from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open.,NKE,0.9051555395126344,0.8103109659617937,Positive
Thanks so much. John I think weve talked on several calls about the investment in data and even on this one. And so I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Datalogue acquisition And then I think Matt on prior calls has talked about the margin advantage of digital. But it seems to me that there is some real PL benefits from the scaling of data. So if you kind of had to dream the dream what do you think the opportunity is there Thank you.,NKE,0.999971091747284,0.9999421834601068,Positive
Well Matt maybe Ill dream the dream around the consumer and you can dream the dream around our income statement. I think they are very linked. Jamie its  I had to say were just scratching the surface. I mean so yes Datalogue is our fourth data and analytics acquisition over the past couple of years. And they use machine learning to help automate translating raw data into critical and actionable insights and doing it realtime at enterprise scale. And so as I said earlier youre beginning to see whether its improved and personalized search results whether youre seeing more personalized recommendations of what if you bought this you should buy this if its anticipating timing of when youre due for potentially some new footwear or some new apparel. Data just allows us to have a more personalized experience with consumers and its what consumers want and expect from a brand like NIKE There are an awful lot of brands out there or platforms where they dont want people they dont want people to know them well. NIKE is a brand and Jordan where consumers want us to know them well and offer that even better experience. And then as you said and as I said a minute ago almost across every step of our value chain data enables us to one deliver the right product right place right time to that consumer. As I described earlier and two it drives efficiency and productivity. But our focus will be on the consumer. And thats one of the things that I think has always been a hallmark of NIKE is the consumer is absolutely at the center. And so were going to prioritize that and continue to invest heavily in technology enablement and data. And as you said scale matters. Scale matters because you get the most actionable data. This is  its true in the technology industry. Its also true I think in our industry and so well have a scale advantage in data. And it will drive both better consumer experience and efficiency. Matt do you want to comment add to that,NKE,1.0,1.0,Positive
Yes. So Ill dream the dream on the financial side of it. We think that as Ive said for several quarters in a row and Andy said before me that the financial value of data and technology are significant for us. And were already starting to see some of it Jamie in our current performance but the opportunity in front of us is significant. Its being right more of the time. And where youll see it drive financial value through our PL is making better pricing and merchandising decisions where we place our inventory how we choose to fulfill demand. All of those things will result in and we see how a much more scientific and datadriven and machine learning approach to this is taking  is using human judgment with great analytics to enable us to make those decisions. And then I think more broadly as an enterprise as we continue to automate the way we work and leverage technology endtoend there is going to be productivity in the manual processes and work that we do as a company today. And so I think youll also see productivity in SGA over time as a result of us being able to leverage this type of capacity versus working in a more legacy type of fashion. And so were investing heavily towards all of those opportunities.,NKE,0.9999732375144958,0.9999464749970883,Positive
And Matt Im going to just maybe add one final comment before we wrap up because I do want to  weve had two three data questions in a row but as you said Jamie art and science. The science the science of what we are doing its been done its doable. But the thing that makes this company remarkable is the art. Its the creativity of our apparel designers of our footwear designers. Its the creativity of our brand teams and the storytelling they do and so data doesnt displace art. Its both. Its data and technology help enhance it and supplement it. But this  the core of this the heart and soul of this company is an amazing wellspring of creativity and innovation and the mindset in everything we do. And so I just  this is going to make it a little bit more directtoconsumer and make it a little bit more efficient. But we will never lose sight of the art of what NIKE Jordan and Converse do. So with that Andy time to wrap up.,NKE,0.999923825263977,0.9998476504371467,Positive
Yes. Thank you Jamie and thank you everyone. We appreciate you joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. So take care.,NKE,0.9999953508377076,0.999990701669873,Positive

Thanks Jean and hello everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We delivered another recordbreaking quarter to finish fiscal 2020 capping off the best full year results in our 38year history. This year we surpassed 1.8 billion in top line sales and increase adjusted EBITDA by over 56 to 300 million. These results were achieved in a year of unprecedented challenges and demonstrates the strength of our business model and the extraordinary execution of our team.

Comp store sales increased 8.8. As you may recall our comp trends are running in the lowsingle digits early in the quarter and we saw momentum build as we progressed through the holiday season and into January. We continued to benefit from spending trends that worked in our favor with a shift in demand for merchandise that appealed to a stayathome lifestyle. In January we believe the second round of government stimulus also fueled some of the comp sales growth.,OLLI,0.9879459142684937,0.9758918141673887,Positive

We have a proven ability to handle large deals from our suppliers and an exceptionally strong liquidity position. We are pleased with our current inventory position ending the quarter with inventories up 5.5 compared to last year. Our continued sales velocity has us chasing the business a little but as I mentioned deal flow remains as strong as ever. As you heard me say before our approach to maintaining dry powder and our opentobuy gives us the flexibility to ramp up receipts and opportunistic purchases.,OLLI,0.9521900415420532,0.9043800260901607,Positive

New stores once again delivered sales above our expectations with our recent store classes across new states and new markets outperforming our model. We opened a total of 46 new stores in 2020 and I am very proud of the teams ability to execute these projects despite the added complexities of operating and opening during the pandemic. New stores remain the primary driver of our growth.

Ollies Army continued to be a significant sales driver in the fourth quarter and membership keeps growing. We ended the period with over 11.6 million active members a 13.6 increase over the prior year with growth in the membership levels outpacing store growth. Army members shop our stores more often and drive a substantially larger basket.

Great deal flow productive new stores and strong comps drove this increase.

We ended the quarter with 388 stores in 25 States a 12.5 yearoveryear increase in store count with a total of 46 new stores for the year.

Gross profit increased 23.6 to 204.7 million and gross margin increased 50 basis points to 39.7. The increase in margin was due to improvement in the merchandise margin and leveraging of supply chain costs. SGA expenses excluding insurance gains in both the current and prior year increased 20 to 114.4 million primarily due to additional selling expenses from our new stores higher store payroll to support the increase in sales and increased incentive compensation. SGA as a percentage of net sales excluding the insurance gains decreased 40 basis points to 22.2. The decrease was driven by leveraging occupancy and many other costs due to our strong sales performance and continued tight expense control.,OLLI,0.0002223551273345,-0.9995564815738689,Negative

While we are optimistic about the momentum of our business there remains uncertainty related to COVID19 and its potential impacts on the economy the consumer and our 2021 results. For these reasons we will not be providing specific guidance at this time but I will share some highlevel thoughts on fiscal 2021. As John indicated were off to a good start with comps tracking in the highsingle digits. We continue to operate in an uncertain environment including the timing and duration of stimulus spending inflation and evolving consumer behavior as we emerge from the pandemic.,OLLI,0.0562221705913543,-0.8875567838888073,Negative
As you know were up against exceptionally strong numbers and strong comps in 2020 with the initial COVID related sales surge beginning in midApril. The second quarter will certainly be our most difficult comparison both from a sales and net income standpoint given our incredible performance in 2020. The third and fourth quarter comparisons will be challenging as well as we continue to perform at unprecedented levels and saw topline benefits from economic stimulus. Under normal circumstances we would not expect to comp these numbers.,OLLI,0.8891462087631226,0.7782922853781493,Positive
We are anticipating some headwinds in gross margin due to ongoing supply chain pressures impacting all retailers such as increased important trucking costs. We expect a headwind of approximately 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the year taking us from our typical target of 40 gross margin to 39.7 to 39.8 for the year. In addition to these increased costs we are currently seeing increased port congestion which could create delays in certain imported product categories. However as always disruption of this nature may lead to opportunities down the road.,OLLI,0.9041420221328736,0.8082839299940647,Positive
Finally SGA as you know we have and always will keep a tight rein on our expenses however even with the continued prudent approach to expense management we are facing very challenging comparisons given the leverage we achieved in 2020. We expect to return to more historical norms in our SGA expense rate for 2021. Our current plans include the following the opening of 50 stores including three to four relocations. Were planning a split of approximately 5050 in openings between the first and second halves of the year. We feel confident that we can achieve our target but we will be dependent on local market conditions to stay on schedule.,OLLI,0.9994440078735352,0.9988880150842756,Positive
We expect capital expenditures of 40 million to 45 million primarily for new stores IT projects and store level initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense in the range of 26 million to 27 million excluding  including approximately 6 million that runs through cost of goods sold. And effective tax rate of 25.2 which excludes the tax benefits related to stockbased compensation and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 66.6 million before any impact from stock buybacks. While challenges remain in 2021 opportunities also exist. The strength of our model in both strong and weak economic cycles our very strong financial position and our confidence in our ability to deliver on our longterm growth algorithm have us excited as ever for the future.,OLLI,0.9637540578842164,0.927508072559877,Positive

Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your question please.,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Great thanks. John maybe to kick off could you just elaborate on customer behavior that youre seeing quartertodate Maybe any early takeaways from this round of stimulus versus the round a year ago And when its all said and done I mean do you believe this pandemic will ultimately prove additives to Ollies brand awareness or market share Just kind of trying to think about the model on the other side as we approach the end hopefully of this pandemic,OLLI,0.9998315572738647,0.9996631143469299,Positive
Sure Matt. I would say from what we can see obviously its very very early on and what I would call the third stimulus package that just came out starting Friday Saturday of this past week but the behaviors are really resembling what we saw on the stimulus one and two relative to the immediate response to our  at least our model were seeing some some pretty nice benefits from what people are doing.,OLLI,0.9999254941940308,0.9998509882992437,Positive
I do believe that we will see some continued benefits all the way through probably midpart of April until we go up against the first stimulus that was introduced last year. So well have some headwinds at that point in time but I think we have some pretty good runway from now until the middle of ph April.,OLLI,0.9996998310089112,0.9993996616599929,Positive
In terms of longterm I think that no different than we saw in 2008 2009 I think people who try us like us and they like the discounts they like the brand names and like the closeout that we offer and the value we present. So I think that we will have some stickiness with those folks and that should be a benefit for us on a longterm basis.,OLLI,0.9977031350135804,0.9954062672890829,Positive
Right. And then maybe just to follow up what does the overall product availability picture look like right now in the marketplace for you today Im curious how your  my guess is youre probably chasing inventory now but then as we think about going up against some of these tougher compares just how are you planning inventory between nearterm and back half of the year And last just on that point as we think about your backend model from a merchandise margin opportunity on the buying front does this provide you some level of insulation as we think about the freight headwind that I know youre facing as well,OLLI,0.976598024368286,0.9531960208392265,Positive
Yes. Matt I would tell you we are having no problems whatsoever securing product in great brands and great names at great prices. Its actually been better than I would have expected at this point in time. And its very broad based its not one category or two categories were seeing in every single category which is a little earlier than I wouldve expected. Our merchants are appropriately bought up and theyre in great shape from an opentobuy perspective. But we are not in any way shape or form having problems getting inventory purchased from our manufacturers and our relationships. So from that perspective Im very excited.,OLLI,0.975823163986206,0.9516462991513606,Positive
And I think its only going to get better in the remainder part of the year. I think as some of the retailers and manufacturers lap some numbers from last year theyre going to probably overproduce and were going to have more opportunity as well as we continue to go forward.,OLLI,0.891456127166748,0.7829121249390394,Positive
I think you had one other question Matt that I might not have answered.,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes it was more just merchandise with the plentiful availability out there how best to think about the merchandise margin opportunity that historically youre able to offset some of these headwinds that are more transitory could that be an opportunity if things come in better,OLLI,0.9924793839454652,0.9849587589256521,Positive
Yes. I would tell you the answer on that is we always are going to get back to the consumer where we can and try to maintain our 40point gross margin. As Jay said were probably shooting for a 37 to 38 today with what were seeing in the marketplace.,OLLI,0.2428306639194488,-0.5143395747778267,Negative
39.7.,OLLI,0.7641775012016296,0.5283547212807662,Positive
Sorry 39.7 39.8 from where were at today. If we can get more and theres more availability on the price well take it. But more likely than not if we can give back to the consumer maintain the 40 points thats what we would shoot for.,OLLI,0.9296459555625916,0.8592918272565766,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Your question please.,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. John you had mentioned some digital initiatives for 2021. I was hoping you could tease that out a little bit more and maybe on that note wondering if theres any consideration to your goto market strategy with advertising which has been heavily print dominant in the past. I need to ask about this a lot but with consumer behavior shifting online while you dont have a website perhaps some of your advertising could also be shifting to be more digital,OLLI,0.996648907661438,0.9932978113280602,Positive
Yes. Peter were in the initial stages and weve talked about it a few times were definitely planning to move some of our dollars from print to what I call mass media or digital. Were working on that. Were working on that for 2021 as well and I think thats just another means to attract new consumer and speak to people in different fashions. But were definitely working on that and the marketing team is very focused on doing more card linked offers working through Facebook Instagram we just hired Sasha as a firm out there to help us with Google and really looking at that.,OLLI,0.9944820404052734,0.9889640742326224,Positive
Were not going to go 100 digital ever but the print will be augmented with our digital campaigns. So well move some of that dollars around but I think were not going to become an ecom business but were looking to refine our website and looking to refine all the digital means that are out there and continue to augment what we have. So I think were well positioned to do that this year and going forward.,OLLI,0.9624450206756592,0.9248899965822677,Positive
And Peter this is Jay just to tack on a little bit to that. I mean obviously the consumer has shifted a little bit and because we cant advertise we really cant do our closeout business online but given the strength in the numbers and the trends that weve seen its almost reinforced the fact that this  there is room for brick and mortar especially when theres a value and theres a treasure hunt. And so that still resonates with the consumer. And we have got a lot of white space and a lot of growth ahead of us. So obviously thats our focus.,OLLI,0.9333816766738892,0.8667632739325011,Positive
Okay. Thats sounds interesting. And maybe Jay to follow up with you on a financial question you talked about the strong comps you saw back in the 2008 2009 recession. I think 2009 you comped at 8 and then 2010 was a flat to your stack of plus 8 is that maybe some type of framework we could think about for this year or do you just see too many differences with whats going on now versus back then,OLLI,0.9510140419006348,0.902028025405422,Positive
Yes Peter I mean were not giving guidance. But yes weve talked about that framework before and thats a reasonable way to look at it from a kind of a base plan and base case modeling right. We obviously had a heck of a last year so we wouldnt expect the comp at negative 8 as a rational way to think about it. The other way from a framework standpoint how we think about it a little bit as if we look at 2019 our normal top line growth rate is call it 14 to 15. So if we have two years of that from 2019 grow top line 30 and that might get you in the ballpark but again were not giving guidance but trying to just give a framework for a kind of a base model.,OLLI,0.9997051954269408,0.999410390502447,Positive
Okay. All right. Thanks so much. And good luck.,OLLI,0.9997599124908448,0.9995198246954828,Positive
Thanks Peter.,OLLI,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thanks Peter.,OLLI,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Chandni Luthra from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.,OLLI,0.8899539709091187,0.7799078106330697,Positive
Hi thank you for taking my question. Hope everybodys well. I want you to talk about the larger number of new signups that you guys have seen very impressive stat. Perhaps you could give us some sense of how the new members within your Ollies Army are looking versus traditional members. How are the demographics What are they looking to buy and how has that buying shifts as you know now that a lot of these members are six months into the program perhaps Thank you.,OLLI,0.9993076920509338,0.9986153832765718,Positive
Sure. We dont necessarily have the demographic profile of the customers as they onboard. So Im not able to answer that question to you right now. But I can tell you we have had nice signup and nice activity within the overall new membership for 2020. Were excited with what were seeing there their behaviors are not much different than the overall Ollies Army membership that weve had. I can tell you the overall spend in the Army theyre averaging about 40 per basket versus non Ollies Army member of about 30 so theyre spending about 37 more per average basket which is much larger than it used to be.,OLLI,0.8646864891052246,0.7293728169040781,Positive
So were getting a nice traction with the customer base that were seeing in the stores. Definitely have seen some additional velocity from the folks that have signed up during Q2 of 2020 and what their purchasing habits were in Q4 compared to the prior year. So we did see some nice increase in spend and additional new members that signed up and came in the store. So I think we attracted some new individuals and saw them come back to our store multiple times. So were excited with what were seeing there and we hope to continue to see that trend as we go forward.,OLLI,0.9999297261238098,0.9998594521638466,Positive
Great. And if I could quickly follow that up with the highsingle digit counts that you are seeing quartertodate. I know you dont have a lot of stores in Texas but I just wanted to quickly check. Was there any negative impact that you saw from that region generally from the cold snap that we saw in the Country in February or perhaps any aftermath of that resulted in increased demand in certain products. Thank you.,OLLI,0.9946230053901672,0.9892460043704536,Positive
Yes. We definitely saw a direct impact to not only Texas it impacted Louisiana and went up through Tennessee and to Kentucky. So it was more widespread than just Texas. Texas got the brunt of it. And as you know one of our distribution centers is right outside of Dallas and that was impacted in shutdown for an entire week. So we definitely had some impacts on the business. But  and to your point I believe all it was timing wise. I think we got that back and well get that back.,OLLI,0.9120155572891236,0.8240310096925556,Positive
But it definitely caused some headwinds in the first month. But I think that came back to us with additional purchases and people buying more stuff they need for the home but as you know thats not a big part of our overall comp base but it definitely had an impact in February I think were getting that back.,OLLI,0.1657929718494415,-0.6684150507539814,Negative
Great.,OLLI,0.969902276992798,0.9398045181062928,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital. Your question please.,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey good afternoon John and Jay.,OLLI,0.9948093295097352,0.9896186528317052,Positive
Hi Brad.,OLLI,0.7536945343017578,0.5073887749843449,Positive
Hi Brad.,OLLI,0.7536945343017578,0.5073887749843449,Positive
My first question is if you could give us  thanks. My first question was around trends in traffic and ticket. And if youd just give us a little more color about how those trended in the quarter and how youre thinking about those for 2021,OLLI,0.906935214996338,0.8138703190507408,Positive
Yes Brad this is Jay. In the quarter the transactions were down lowsingle digits and then the average basket was up in double digits to get to the comp that we had of an 8.8. So not inconsistent with what weve seen during this pandemic fewer shopping trips but people are buying more when theyre here. And the average basket was really driven by the units per transaction versus any change in the quarter at least on AUR.,OLLI,0.8385281562805176,0.6770561200714826,Positive
And then looking forward we are in the closeout business so we dont really plan the business around those metrics. We dont know if a deal is going to drive traffic or drive the basket. But we know were going to react. And like John said our deal flow is strong and we expect to have good deals. I mean obviously with the stimulus we  most recently weve seen very strong trends tying to that. So well see how that goes. Its going to be different. I think the stimulus flow this year versus last year but well just do what we do best which is react to the business and get what the customer wants.,OLLI,0.999114453792572,0.99822890652949,Positive
Great. And Jay in your prepared remarks you referenced the current port congestion and how it could lead to some opportunities of course as weve seen in years past when youve gotten port issues. But just to be clear are there any issues on the negative side that you all are seeing right now in the port issues,OLLI,0.0515245497226715,-0.8969520312261767,Negative
Sure. Brad this is John. With regards to the port issues the only issues that we see is theres twofold theres a lot of congestion coming out of Asia. And a lot of lack of containers. And then obviously the cost of moving containers is much higher than it was previously. But getting into the overall marketplace Long Beach is definitely a challenge. But we definitely have some delays that were working through but we believe were going to be in good shape and not have any real risks for the season so thats the main take away from my perspective but were definitely working diligently at that piece and were moving our products as fast as we can. And thats just seasonal and talking to summer furniture lawn and garden and air conditioner is not all our products that challenge.,OLLI,0.8612668514251709,0.7225335374674424,Positive
Thats very helpful John. One more for you John just in terms of thinking about how youre leading the buying team and some of the decisions right now the company over many years its been a welloiled machine where the merchants own the deal and control the markdowns if the items are not selling could you just talk a little bit about how you make sure that the team is operating as efficiently as possible as you go up against these difficult comparisons where you may not have inventory where items may end up sitting on the shelves a bit longer than usual And how you just make sure you optimize the organization during this couple of quarters youre going to be up against,OLLI,0.9943625926971436,0.9887251786739699,Positive
Yes. Brad I would tell you nothing has changed with our merchant team. Everybody has been trained according to how Mark would have wanted it to be done and thats still happening each and every day. Theres no change in how our markets are  our merchants are managing the business. So theres nothing that were implementing differently. They own the product from the time they write the purchase order till it goes out the door.,OLLI,0.9826539754867554,0.9653079302954257,Positive
With regards to how weve managed the business Brad we  one of my big piece is where to maintain dry powder and maintain lower inventory levels in the stores and what we historically have done thats led to us having a lot Id say a lot easier operational activities in the stores and were not having and dont see any slowdown in the inventory in the stores. The challenges are actually less than what they used to be is were a lot cleaner. We dont have the challenges of top stocking goods being stuck on the shelves for an extended period of time. So were actually in a very good position to where the merchants have a lot of opentobuy readytogo and the stores can take it. Were not pushing the stores that hard at all were clean ready to go.,OLLI,0.0019895434379577,-0.9960221028459686,Negative

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens. Your question please.,OLLI,0.8148397207260132,0.6296792207236412,Positive
Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So the cash position for 447 million in cash interested in priorities there is there a minimum level you need to run the business and you got a buyback program in place. Is there any potential here for dividend for your shareholders,OLLI,0.999971866607666,0.9999437331817944,Positive
Yes Rick this is Jay. And Ill speak to that. I mean I think obviously the board just authorized the increase in the stock buyback program by another 100 million. So weve got about 260 million out there 60 million of that expires in the relative near term. So depending on what happens there weve really got 200 million that were focused on. I think from a cash standpoint to run the business we still do want to maintain some flexibility in liquidity. So maybe 200 million is kind of the amount on the balance sheet that we would target to keep.,OLLI,0.1843638122081756,-0.6312733478983331,Negative
And then we would look to as I said in the prepared remarks we want to deploy the rest and we want to invest in ourselves and do a stock buyback program. We dont have the details around that or the amounts for the timing just yet but its something were going to be talking about and focusing on once we get past this call and get into an open trading window. But we would expect to use that excess cash in a stock buyback program and not for a dividend or a special dividend and be more consistent with that going forward because we expect the business to continue to fund its internal growth to fund our growth with internal cash and continue to generate cash beyond that.,OLLI,0.9978152513504028,0.9956305000963808,Positive
Great. Thanks for that color Jay. John you spoke to the categories have a strength in the quarter. Can you talk about some of the products that may have lagged the chain,OLLI,0.9967230558395386,0.9934461077726531,Positive
Sure. with regards to  obviously we have always had that occur but our smaller departments during the quarter would have been the toy category candy luggage so from my perspective toys was understandable. We actually had a real nice comp in Q3. So I think there was a pull forward of some of our toy sales during the year people were shopping earlier. So toys did just fine but they were up double digit in Q3 and just didnt perform quite as well as we would have seen from last year. But overall we were very pleased and came out of the toy season very very clean.,OLLI,0.9898265600204468,0.9796531079132007,Positive
Candy was really related to the timing of deal flow. Candy deal flows were real strong during fourth quarter but all be enough came January and the candy deals came right to us and weve been having a great candy season so far. So were very excited about it. And that was just timing of deal flow. And luggage people arent traveling to buy luggage so that wouldnt totally make sense to us.,OLLI,0.977164387702942,0.9543287481836966,Positive
Other than that we had some real strong performance with all the state home categories bed and bath housewares flooring food and HBA where were really really really strong during the quarter and seasonal as well as weve seen it was off the charts for us.,OLLI,0.1442611217498779,-0.7114787766210894,Negative
If you look at closeout pipeline what categories are showing the most promise for the most opportunities,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I would tell you right now most all of our categories are showing a lot of promise. I am seeing a lot of deal flow in the HBA front. A lot of deal flow in the housewares front bed and bath is real strong. Sporting goods has been real good. Everythings  the only area I would tell you  if you had to say worse or a shortage or a challenge its one item its pool chlorine. Pool chlorine is not easy to get and theres a chlorine shortage nationally that were all going to have to deal with. Other than that we dont feel any pressure on any other category in the entire business.,OLLI,0.0011233687400817,-0.9977544532742819,Negative

Hi this is actually Hannah Pittock on for Simeon. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned given the strong sales youre chasing the business in some cases and Im wondering does that create a wider range of gross margin than you would usually see Are you expecting any volatility there is that built into your 39.7 to 38  39.8 gross margin expectation. So if theres any other risk factors that you can talk about that are embedded in that gross margin that would be helpful.,OLLI,0.999080777168274,0.9981615532407484,Positive
No Morgan I think the closeout business in its nature is called chasing the businesses chasing the deals. Thats what we do each and every day. Thats not anything different from our merchants. They chase it all the time. What we have right now is a little more flexibility a little more dry powder where they can collapse on deals faster but our model is to try to maintain a 40 gross margin and get back to the consumer build loyalty.,OLLI,0.9998160600662231,0.9996321199131726,Positive
So were not trying to use that as a margin driver. Were always trying to shoot for the 40 gross margin theres a lot of cake mix to that but thats what we try to do and I think were poised to continue to deliver consistent margin as Jay had called out earlier.,OLLI,0.9729044437408448,0.9458088551812502,Positive
Thats helpful. Thank you.,OLLI,0.9984360933303832,0.9968721847964432,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.,OLLI,0.7811567783355713,0.5623132957895374,Positive
Hey good afternoon guys. Two questions first followup on I think it might be some peers question. Jay you suggested to your stacks may be a framework for people to kind of think about for 2021 but I think when you start dealing with really large nominal numbers using stacks it starts to distort the numbers a bit. So could sales per store sales per square foot potentially be a better frame workforce for 2021,OLLI,0.9816089868545532,0.9632179517852972,Positive
Yes I mean its fair. Weve had that discussion Scott after the last call a little bit. And to your point right there is a certain level of when you look at stacks that the by store productivity maybe gets too low especially when were looking at certain quarters like a Q2 where were going up against the 43 3 comp. I mean that is still a huge comp to go against them. Were not going be able to match that,OLLI,0.0676198303699493,-0.86476145074454,Negative
Thats why we kind of have gone to the 2019 basis thats kind of the last actual known that we have thats true. And if we grow that 30 you are going to get in the ballpark. Were not giving guidance but thats kind of we started to think of it for our base model kind of against 2019 and expanding that top line by 30. And weve got the margin at the 39.7 38. The SGA we would expect to be more normalized which is call it 25 maybe a little bit north of there. And then you drop that through and you get down to adjusted net income growth which is really in line with our longterm algorithm on a twoyear basis which would be the 36 37.,OLLI,0.9884260892868042,0.9768521647764234,Positive
Yes thats very helpful. And then thanks for all the deal flow commentary but I guess one of the questions I think people are struggling with John is just how is it you guys are seeing strong deal flow in categories whether its some of the homerelated stuff you mentioned sporting goods et cetera. Most of us are hearing about product shortages in those categories. If you can just kind of connect those dots for people I think itd be really helpful for the investor base.,OLLI,0.999792218208313,0.9995844361689306,Positive
Yes Scott I think this is the number one area that even Mark and I have been challenged ever since weve gone public to get people to understand how we make a living. Weve been doing this for 38 years. So we have longstanding relationships with a lot of vendors. Well over a thousand different vendors. Theres always going to be close outs regardless of what people think and how they view the world theres package change theres obsolescence that happens theres shelf pools. I mentioned this a few calls ago that close outs could create in many different ways just as there may be shortages of the inline product it doesnt mean theres not close out availability. Close out availability will exist all the time good times and bad times. Its just the way it works.,OLLI,0.9997483491897584,0.9994966980795255,Positive
Stuff that may be short dated. Short dated for Target and Walmart might be 18 months. Short dated for us is probably 90 days. So theres a big difference in terms of where that product can go from the CPG company. So theres a gamut of reasons things become available or people cancel orders. But I can tell you with a hundred percent confidence our buyers are flushed with goods. They are not having a hard time finding product and were not having any type of misses. Were not changing category mix to make things work better for us. Were buying the categories that we have always bought and well continue what were doing. We have not changed our business strategy one bit.,OLLI,1.1622905731201172e-05,-0.9999779462682881,Negative

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Your question please.,OLLI,0.7811567783355713,0.5623132957895374,Positive
Hey guys this is Brandon Cheatham on for Paul. Im sorry to like keep going back to the inventory side but when we look at a per store basis it seems pretty lean. Could you just talk about it Is that what you wanted and with plenty of opentobuy or is there more opportunity there to lean down inventory And then just on the competition side for product anything different in the put some takes there Thanks.,OLLI,0.9697955250740052,0.939591014141449,Positive
Yes I dont think the inventory the word lean would be necessarily what I would be thinking where we  our inventory turned three times this year. So from a retail perspective Id say you probably think were slow turner. Were lean from what we used to do but I think were right where we are. So I think reducing the levels from where we were previously is were spot on where wed like to be. And we need to continue to maintain where were sitting today and on a longterm basis I think that this makes for a great shopping experience for the consumer and it makes the model work very efficiently.,OLLI,0.9949455261230468,0.9898910462206876,Positive
So I would tell you where were very satisfied where we are at on average inventory per square foot basis in the stores. And three turn for us is great. We moved up from a 2.2 to a three. So I think thats probably about as fast as Ollies can turn but were excited about it.,OLLI,0.9960283041000366,0.9920566034654399,Positive

Competition.,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes comp were not seeing a huge change in competition close outs are different animal. We dont see a lot of people who are able to buy nearly much as we can buy. Most people dont like to deal with close outs. A lot of the bigger retailers its not easy. They are not set up to deal with it. So were probably one of the first choices youre going to see from a closeout perspective in the marketplace. So were not having a lot of competition given the goods we get.,OLLI,0.0077971220016479,-0.984406938795411,Negative
Got it. Thanks. Good luck.,OLLI,0.9997814893722534,0.9995629784840216,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Your question please.,OLLI,0.7811567783355713,0.5623132957895374,Positive
Hey guys. I wanted to ask you just a question about product mix. How mix is looking like currently close out versus sort of direct source product Has that changed at all over the past year And then as you sort of think about like where trends are going is there opportunity in direct source Just curious as to how you are sort of thinking about like that traditional sort of 70 mix and how that has been floated if at all,OLLI,0.9534829258918762,0.9069657963310458,Positive
Yes Ed I would tell you this year we were basically flat with our normal close out mix to the total were close to 70. The only caveat to that is we did buy a ton of PPE that would  some of them might have been closed up but multi was not closed out. So that would have impacted our overall closeout mixed somewhere down close to 66 of our overall purchases PPE that we purchased. But we believe well be back to the 70 here in 2021. And that is something thats not a problem for us. I dont foresee us buying as nearly as much PP this year as we did last year but the overall mix of 70 close outs I believe is a good number for us and then 18 on the everyday value goods and 12 on the imports is about where we think well be.,OLLI,0.002940148115158,-0.9941208923583583,Negative
Okay. And then as you think about this second quarter lap just kind of curious as to whether theres any more color you can provide in terms of how you are thinking about it. Im just curious I mean it was so unusual. The time period and I was curious also right like how product the availability was at that time Is this lap harder or easier than it looks just any thoughts there would be helpful,OLLI,0.9999764561653136,0.9999529123025608,Positive
On Q2 Ed,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes.,OLLI,0.7864110469818115,0.5728218393455979,Positive
Yes Q2 is a mountain. Q2 no matter how you want to slice it a 43.3 comp for anybody is I think that was  I think that was the largest comp number of any retailer that reported. And I would tell you that we worked very hard to do that. And by keeping in mind I think at that time most all retail that were nonessential were closed. So that was a very different time than were in today. All retail are back open now. So everyone is competing for the dollar. So theres definitely a very large disparity this year versus last year in terms of where Q2 is going to be for those of us that were open during the pandemic and for those of us that generate a 43 comp thats going to be  that number is a big number to even dream of bound comping.,OLLI,0.0019332766532897,-0.9961346364823799,Negative
So we definitely dont expect to comp that number but were setting up to do the best we can and do the largest sales and profit to our shareholders and well continue to do that. But we dont expect to be positive.,OLLI,0.9996644258499146,0.9993288512997933,Positive
Understood. Thank you.,OLLI,0.9743350744247437,0.9486701182544937,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas from Bank of America. Your question please.,OLLI,0.7811567783355713,0.5623132957895374,Positive
JasonHaas,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi thanks for taking my question. So I saw you recently did a buyer professional and workwear clothing. So Im curious to know how that performs and if you could potentially do more in the apparel category,OLLI,0.9229127764701844,0.8458254610451825,Positive
Yes Jason as we would always tell you we do buys every day. And the workwear category is a buy we do each and every year. The one that youre talking about was a special buyout from a bankruptcy that occurred. So we do it each and every year just like the wedding dresses. So its a bankruptcy buyout. We do a ton of this. This is just our model. So were working on another deal right now thats related to that same organization. Thatll come in here probably the next month into our stores. Thats more of on the professional work where not necessarily the rugged work so youll see that come in our store. And thats just how we make a living.,OLLI,0.9999434947967528,0.9998869895261462,Positive
With regards to changing our overall strategy to more clothing absolutely not. That is of low interest to us. Were going to buy clothes outs to put them in the stores. And the workwear is in our sweet spot. Thats what we do. Thats how we make the living. Wedding dresses were not how we make a living. And that was something that we had to figure out how to work through the rugged wear is great. And when we got it it was a great deal for us to have.,OLLI,0.999980092048645,0.9999601840735579,Positive
So we expect to see additional clothing deals as we did last year the C9 deal that we saw in Q2. And we see clothing deals all the time that come across our desk. But we see deals coming in every single category and well continue to see those. And I dont expect any monumental change likely. Were not getting into fashion. We dont like fashion risk and thats not what we do. Were really more of a hardline retailer. I think clothing makes up 2 or 3 of our overall sales and thats not going to change.,OLLI,0.9977542161941528,0.9955084297111212,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Hamblin from CraigHallum. Your question please.,OLLI,0.7811567783355713,0.5623132957895374,Positive
Yes thanks. And great quarter.,OLLI,0.9978423118591307,0.9956846211460952,Positive
Thanks Jeremy.,OLLI,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
I wanted to just ask and see if we can get even a little bit more granularity. And actually I wanted to ask more about Q1 than Q2. I know you dont normally disclose cadence around the month within a quarter but  because of we had the end of March I think was really really tough. And I think we  youve given a little more color on that. I did want to see those last two weeks or the second half of April I did want to get a sense for if you could quantify the magnitude of the comps that you saw in those weeks. I just think from a modeling perspective that would go a long way in hoping especially with you guys are off to a pretty strong start here in Q1.,OLLI,0.8927772045135498,0.7855542812074907,Positive
Yes Jeremy I cant give too much color. But I can give you directionally where we saw last year. Obviously when the economy closed down I think it was March 11 of last year. We saw significant decreases in our model for about a fourweek period almost a fiveweek period but closer to like four and a half weeks which took us to the last two weeks of our fiscal calendar of April. And as the stimulus came in about April 15 April 13 and we were a rocketship from that point forward all the way through Q2.,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So theres some big numbers on the back half of the last two weeks of April. Weve got probably another three  three plus weeks of pretty good sailing I think here with the way the timing of the stimulus came in stimulus number three versus the economy being shut down last year.,OLLI,0.019730269908905,-0.9605406287554674,Negative
Okay. Well,OLLI,0.9854629039764404,0.9709257906233015,Positive
I dont know if that helps you but thats kind of directionally what we...,OLLI,0.2497462332248687,-0.5005084279229809,Negative
No it gives us a sense. Okay.,OLLI,0.7276496291160583,0.45529893356498086,Positive
Yes.,OLLI,0.7864110469818115,0.5728218393455979,Positive
So the second question I wanted to ask was Ollies Army week versus a single night in Q4. And just wanted to see if you could provide some additional color on how you felt that performed. Obviously I think this wasnt unusual holiday season where a lot of buying was pulled forward. But you clearly saw pretty good performance obviously in January but maybe December turned out better than November was. So I wanted to see if you could provide some color on that week. And then as we think forward to Q4 this year is that something where maybe its going to be Ollies Army week going forward instead of a single night.,OLLI,0.8251128792762756,0.6502255500707328,Positive
Right. Jeremy this is Jay. Yes we were pleased with our holiday season. Like you said we didnt participate in a lot of the early sales that were happening in November. It seems like people really started Black Friday early. But our November  at the time we announced low single digits and December was stronger than that. Our holiday period for those two months together was in the midsingle digits. So we were pleased with that. And then to your point January was very strong with the stimulus that came in that month.,OLLI,0.996615707874298,0.9932314117142029,Positive
And as far as Ollies Army week versus Ollies Army night the week itself was probably flattish a little bit down to the year ago period. And part of that was because in the prior year we aim to actually ran a 25 of Toys promotion for the public not only the army but anybody that came in the store.,OLLI,0.8296170234680176,0.6592338438235783,Positive
So from a topline standpoint we are actually a little bit negative on the week from a margin standpoint because we were less promotional. It was beneficial. So that is the week.,OLLI,0.9437270164489746,0.8874539658152854,Positive
Next year or this year I guess looking forward to Ollies Army night our leaning is that we would go back to the one night. We kind of like the excitement and the buzz that it generates for the customer to come in. And its just kind of a tradition and a longstanding event that creates a lot of excitement both for our stores and our shoppers most importantly. So were leaning towards the one night going back to that.,OLLI,0.9995254278182985,0.9990508550708623,Positive
Yes Jeremy the only caveat to that is if theres still issues with COVID and restrictions on number of people in the store and whatnot then wed have to adjust accordingly. But well see where were at what time to make that decision.,OLLI,0.1196476221084594,-0.760705805245522,Negative
Lets hope not. Thanks for taking the questions.,OLLI,0.9378364682197572,0.8756728623347656,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. Your question please.,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong finish to a strong year. I guess my question in terms of the new store openings just any sense for how much  just roughly what percentage of those are going to be in existing markets versus new markets Thank you.,OLLI,0.996356725692749,0.992713447042374,Positive
Yes Anthony were going to open up in three new states this year as I said earlier Kansas Missouri and Vermont. In terms of backfilling and existing versus new markets I would tell you were probably going to do 30 or 40 in existing markets and the rest comes in the newer markets. I wouldnt say new markets but were still infants in the state of Texas were still infants in Oklahoma. Were still backfilling some of the newer states.,OLLI,0.8450430631637573,0.690085941604341,Positive
But overall if you  literally speaking if you want to look at Kansas Vermont and Missouri thats probably only a handful of stores. So most of that would come in existing states that were in. But we view Texas as new and Oklahoma as new. But were predominantly focused on the new markets. But were still back filling in existing markets as well.,OLLI,0.976115584373474,0.952231140274489,Positive
Got it. And then just a related followup I guess how is your I mean obviously given this COVID19 dystopia I mean how have you sort of changed your new store openings Im assuming you just cant sort of advertise the way that you did and get big crowds in the stores. And so how has that changed if at all,OLLI,0.9971808791160583,0.9943617548714607,Positive
Yes definitely a good question Anthony. Last year once COVID hit we never ran any grand opening campaigns in the stores during the heavy period of the pandemic. So we basically just did regular flyers and opened the stores very quietly. We never called them grand openings because we couldnt afford to have that many people in the stores at one time. But what we did see which was interesting is we still got the traction in the stores it may not happen in that one day but it still happened pretty quickly where the store has still performed very very well. And I think we learned a little bit about how we can open stores and we dont have to spend as much in advertising as it may have done historically.,OLLI,0.998986840248108,0.9979736792884348,Positive
Got it. Thank you.,OLLI,0.9929356575012208,0.985871306581084,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian McNamara from Berenberg Capital. Your question please.,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you for taking my question. I know you dont typically comment on interquarter trends but you did mention a lowsingledigit start to the quarter three months ago and a stimulus impact on January benefiting the quarter in your prepared remarks. Can you give us an idea how meaningful that stimulus impact was relative to Decembers trend Clearly it was an improving trend throughout the quarter. Thanks.,OLLI,0.9999986886978148,0.9999973773940665,Positive
Yes I dont think the stimulus had anything to do with December whatsoever. The stimulus checks didnt come out too after the 1 of January. So the December results were on their own. They stood on their own.,OLLI,0.0183547139167785,-0.963291742379512,Negative
Thats what I meant. In in terms of the  how meaningful stimulus was in January relative to December,OLLI,0.9413837790489196,0.8827674882218168,Positive
Sorry can you say it again,OLLI,0.2409543693065643,-0.5180921662403144,Negative
Relative to quarter,OLLI,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
What I am trying to get is  so presumably the quarterly trend it improved as a quarter went on Im just trying to kind of tease out how impactful the stimulus was to Januarys trend relative to December.,OLLI,0.1251897513866424,-0.7496215400824191,Negative
Yes it was pretty significant. Relatively speaking as we reported the 8.8 comp for the quarter January was definitely in the double digits from your perspective. So we definitely saw a big acceleration of the holiday period itself being November and December. We were close to a 5 comp.,OLLI,0.9226990938186646,0.8453980954874132,Positive
Got it. Thank you. And then secondly given the massive Q2 comp you guys are going to have to cycle in the strong H2 that you will be cycling is it  would it surprise you have 12 months from now were talking about maybe a minus lowsingledigit comp that you just reported. Can you talk about kind of how you are preparing internally both from a cost standpoint and just an overall business perspective standpoint as youre obviously  are you going to be lapping an unprecedented year this year Thanks.,OLLI,0.994892120361328,0.9897842346335854,Positive
Yes for sure. And like we said on the call we would have never in normal environment kind of a base case we would never expect to lap these numbers. So again were kind of from a base framework were going back to the 2019 actuals and growing the topline two years worth of growth. So call it 30. So that gives you a topline. You can kind of back into probably the split between comp and noncomp. Weve got the margin of 39.7 39.8 SGA levels of more normalized call it 25 little bit north of there.,OLLI,0.9893062114715576,0.9786124101951184,Positive
So thats the model and that results in a base model of adjusted net income of close to 36 37 which is right in line with our longterm algorithm. And of course were going work hard to do better than to do the best we can not turn off the registers like Mark would say. And weve been pretty successful at that. But again these yes trying to comp a year like last year is just not something that Ollies is built for.,OLLI,0.9997527599334716,0.9995055195722098,Positive

And stepping back and reflecting for a moment its hard to believe that 12 months have passed since we first encountered COVID. I think about sitting alongside Mike and Adam one year ago here in our March 2020 earnings call when clarity vanished and uncertainty ran wild. Yet in typical Jabil fashion our people did what they do they dove in and gave their very best to combat the pandemic. They did so by looking after one another while taking outstanding care of our customers. Its a point in time that Ill never forget its a point in time that highlights the level of respect and admiration that I have for our team here at Jabil. Their attitude and their actions continue to impress. And for sure there is no other team Id rather be part of. Again much thanks to all of our employees who simply make Jabil Jabil.,JBL,0.9999974370002748,0.9999948739974942,Positive
Please turn to Slide 5 where well take a look at our 2Q results. Our second quarter came in well ahead of expectations driven by stronger than expected product demand solid execution and a wellbalanced contribution throughout the entire company. The team delivered core earnings per share of 1.27 on revenue of 6.8 billion resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2. Im really pleased with our financial results for the quarter. Although whats quite interesting to me is the overall construct of the business in combination with the improvements weve made to our balance sheet. All in all our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal 21. It also sets a firm foundation for further margin expansion as we look to FY22. As customary Mike will provide more detail around our second quarter results during his prepared remarks.,JBL,0.9999876022338868,0.9999752044529944,Positive
Id now like to share a pie chart which is indicative of our commercial portfolio. Slide 6 underscores the effectiveness of our approach and the base from which we operate. Today our business is wideranging and resilient this is especially true when any individual product or product family is faced with a macro disruption or cyclical demand. Furthermore our current business mix provides a unique set of capabilities innovative capabilities openly shared across the enterprise with speed and precision as we simplify the complex for our customers.

Moving to Slide 7 Ill address our updated outlook for the year. We now believe core earnings will be in the neighborhood of 5 a share an increase of 25 from what we anticipated back in September with top line revenue coming in around 28.5 billion. This incremental revenue improves our portfolio as evidenced by another 10 basis point increase to core operating margin which we now forecast to be 4.2 for the year. Lastly we remain committed to generating a minimum of 600 million in free cash flow a testament to how were managing our capital investments. As I wrap up the outlook its notable that our strategy is working our path is well understood and how we go about producing results is important. On this last point when we think about the how we think about purpose a purpose that guides us in our journey a purpose which is grounded in a series of behaviors behaviors such as keeping our people safe servant leadership ensuring a fully inclusive environment and giving back to our communities around the world. Im just so proud that our team is hitting the mark in all of these areas.,JBL,0.9999593496322632,0.9999186992160674,Positive
As we transition to my final slide I want to once again say thanks to our team. Their efforts over the past two years to three years have allowed us to reshape the business as weve targeted growth in select markets markets that largely align with secular trends. A few examples of these being 5G personalized healthcare electric vehicles digital learning cloud computing clean energy and ecofriendly packaging. Our team continues to develop deep domain expertise in concert with these secular tailwinds. I like the decisions were making and what were doing and we do what we do while respecting the environment and safeguarding our workplace. Were committed to a workplace which encompasses tolerance respect and acceptance. We encourage each and every employee here at Jabil to be their true self. We strive to make the world just a little bit better a little bit healthier and a little bit safer each and every day.,JBL,1.0,1.0,Positive
One factor that makes good companies great is possessing a value system which allows them to solve problems over and over again we embraced this way of thinking and welcome the challenges put forth by our customers.,JBL,0.9818746447563172,0.9637492679055144,Positive
Thank you. And Ill now turn the call over to Mike.,JBL,0.9116989374160768,0.8233977695690213,Positive
Thank you Mark and good morning everyone. As Mark just detailed our second quarter performance was outstanding driven by the combination of broadbased endmarket strength and associated leverage and improved portfolio mix and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team. We saw broadbased revenue strength across the business most notably in mobility cloud healthcare connected devices automotive and semicap. Given the additional revenue I am particularly pleased with the strong leverage we achieved during the quarter which enabled us deliver a strong core operating margin of 4.2. And finally our net interest expense came in better than expected during the quarter due in large part to better working capital management coupled with the proactive steps weve taken over the past year to optimize our capital structure.,JBL,0.9999948740005492,0.9999897479949877,Positive
Putting it all together on the next slide net revenue for the second quarter was 6.8 billion 300 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. On a yearoveryear basis revenue increased by 700 million or 11. GAAP operating income was 236 million and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was 0.99. Core operating income during the quarter was 285 million an increase of 78 yearoveryear representing a core operating margin of 4.2 a 160 basis point improvement over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q2 was 33 million and core tax rate came in at approximately 23. Core diluted earnings per share was 1.27 a 154 improvement over the prior year quarter.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Now turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was 3.6 billion an increase of 26 on a yearoveryear basis. The strong performance in our DMS segment was extremely broadbased as several of the endmarkets we serve are becoming increasingly critical such as connected devices healthcare automotive and mobility. Core margins for the segment came in at an impressive 5.1 210 basis points higher than the previous year an incredible performance by the team. Revenue for our EMS segment was 3.2 billion also reflecting strong broadbased demand. Core margins for the segment were 3.1 80 basis points over the prior year.,JBL,0.9926739931106568,0.9853479774880278,Positive
Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. Cash flows provided by operations were 20 million in Q2 and capital expenditures net of customer coinvestments totaled 152 million. We exited the quarter with cash balance of 838 million. We ended Q2 with committed capacity under the global credit facilities of 3.8 billion. With this available capacity along with our quarterend cash balance Jabil ended Q2 with access to more than 4.6 billion of available liquidity which we believe provides us ample flexibility. During Q2 we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares for 82 million. At the end of the quarter 254 million remained outstanding in our current stock repurchase authorization and we intend to complete this authorization during the second half of FY 21 as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.,JBL,0.9984034299850464,0.9968068580668319,Positive
Turning now to our third quarter guidance. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 19 on a yearoveryear basis to 3.5 billion this is mainly due to strong endmarket outlook. EMS segment revenue is expected to be 3.4 billion an increase of 1 on a yearoveryear basis. Its worth noting our EMS business remained strong and healthy. The modest increase is reflective of our previously announced transition to a consignment model in the cloud business. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 21 to be in the range of 6.6 billion to 7.2 billion or an increase of 9 on a yearoveryear basis at the midpoint of the range. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of 220 million to 270 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of 0.90 to 1.10. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 0.69 to 0.89.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Next Id like to take a few moments to provide an update on the longterm secular trends underway across our businesses which we believe will drive sustainable growth across the enterprise in FY 21 and beyond. In healthcare today the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs aging populations the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. Consequently we are witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing towards innovative and connected product solutions. Were in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. On top of this we are also seeing the impact of connectivity and digitization across healthcare. I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technologyenabled products that help our customers excel in todays evolution of healthcare.,JBL,0.9988681077957152,0.9977362142421089,Positive
Another endmarket experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market. Today electric vehicles account for less than 2 of total vehicles in the market. Climate change fuel efficiency and emissions are ongoing concerns and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more ecofriendly technologies. As a result OEMs are making a substantial investment into vehicle electrification effort. Jabils longstanding capabilities and over 10 years of experience and credibility in this space has positioned us extremely well to benefit from this ongoing trend.,JBL,0.9259237051010132,0.8518473218961489,Positive
Turning now to 5G 5G will transform the way we live work play and educate. As the underlying infrastructure continues to roll out 5G adoption is accelerating. Jabil is well positioned to benefit from both the worldwide infrastructure rollouts and with devices which would be needed to recognize the full potential of a robust 5G network. 5G is also accelerating secular expansion of cloud adoption and infrastructure growth. This coupled with the value proposition Jabil offers to cloud hyperscalers is helping us gain market share in an expanding market evidenced by the significant growth over the last three years. The value proposition that continues to resonate with our customers is our design to dust capabilities which incorporates engineering manufacturing and ecofriendly decommissioning observers ph all within collocated facilities. This is incredibly powerful as accelerating cycle times security and transparency at every step of the hardware lifecycle become continually more important to our US domicile hyperscalers.,JBL,0.9927579760551452,0.9855159434771199,Positive
Shifting now to packaging we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the global shift to smart and ecofriendly packaging. As consumers become more informed about the environmental impact of plastic waste demand for sustainable packaging solutions is accelerating. And then finally within semicap the demand for semiconductors has never been higher with the accelerated convergence of technologies and the associated data generation and storage needs. Nearly every part of the economy runs on silicon today. Jabil serves the semicap space with endtoend solutions spanning the frontend with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the backend with validation and test solutions.,JBL,0.1298078298568725,-0.740385377636777,Negative
In summary Im extremely pleased with the sustainable broadbased momentum underway across the business which has allowed us to deliver much betterthanexpected results in the first half of FY 21. As we turn our attention to the back half of the year and beyond we fully expect the longterm secular tailwinds that are driving our business to continue. This coupled with our improving portfolio mix and lower interest and tax expenses has given us the confidence to meaningfully raise our FY 21 estimates for revenue core operating income core margins and core earnings per share. We now expect core operating margins to be 4.2 on revenue of approximately 28.5 billion ph. This improved outlook translates to core earnings per share of approximately 5. And importantly despite the stronger growth we remain committed to delivering free cash flow in excess of 600 million for the year. Weve been working extremely hard as a team to grow margins cash flows and positively impact our interest and tax. I am very pleased with our teams exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts.,JBL,0.9998700618743896,0.999740123593881,Positive
With that Ill now turn the call over to Adam.,JBL,0.1773987412452697,-0.6452034981271615,Negative

Operator Instructions Our first question today is from Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong results. You know I had a couple of questions. Maybe Mark first question on the EMS side. Youre guiding now to 13.4 billion thats almost a billion dollars higher than the previous guidance. But the operating margin is still guided at 3.6. So just curious I mean why isnt the operating margin target for that for this year for EMS moving up a little bit more Just if you can just talk about the puts and takes on that. Thanks.,JBL,0.9999996423721312,0.9999992847438361,Positive
Thanks Ruplu. I feel good about where the margin. I think youre right we look at the overall corporate margin for the year we think well be around 4.2. And EMS will be in the range of I would guess 3.6 3.7. I look at that relative to fiscal 19. If I go back that far and I think EMS in 19 was around 3 all in. Last year were below that and I acknowledge that was a COVID year with excessive COVID expenses. But I feel pretty good about that business overall. I think were doing the right things in cloud. I look at that business today in terms of a mix of legacy business some businesses that weve gotten a bit of a nudge or help with COVID. But most importantly Ruplu I think about things that Mike was talking about in his prepared remarks in terms of trends that we think are going to be around for a while. Things like 5G electric vehicles cloud computing clean energy.,JBL,0.9986627101898192,0.9973254187854639,Positive
So I feel good about the year. We continue to make OpEx investments as well in the EMS segment but I think were on a good trajectory. The things I obsess about or worry about. The condition of the EMS business the next two three years isnt one of them.,JBL,0.9701539278030396,0.9403078200267672,Positive
Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. And that makes sense. Just on the mobility side I want to ask a general question. I mean are you concerned or how concerned are you about any configuration changes that might come up in the rest of the year Can you may be at a high level just talk about how prepared Jabil is this year versus in prior years about handling mobility related you know volatility that can come up in the rest of the year,JBL,0.9997936487197876,0.9995872971935851,Positive
I dont want to speculate on any configuration changes or anything like that. Our relationship in that space with our main customer there is super solid. And when I just think back about the last two three years of execution Ive got again very little doubt in our ability to execute on the mobility side configuration changes or not. So again not an area that then Im losing a lot of sleep over.,JBL,0.002945989370346,-0.9941092098410189,Negative
Great. Thanks for the details and again congrats on the quarter end and the strong guide. Thank you.,JBL,0.9999812841415404,0.9999625682607698,Positive
The next question is from Adam Tindle of Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay thanks. Good morning. Mark. I wanted to start with a question on operating margin and acknowledge its been very strong so far. A two parter ph just on near term and long term moving forward. So first on near term your Q3 guidance implies that total company operating margin is going to be down maybe somewhere around mid3 range or so and then back up to around 4 or so in Q4 based on the EPS guide if I got that correct doesnt look like thats volume related because revenue is going to be flattish during this time. So maybe just more color on drivers of the Q3 dip and rebound in Q4. And secondly you mentioned longer term as you exit this year with a four handle. The trajectory that that puts you on as you think about fiscal 22 and beyond because you said you wanted to build on that,JBL,0.9990514516830444,0.9981029022353305,Positive
Yes thanks Adam. Q3 is always a little bit of a debit for us. And as much as we take a lot of I dont know if the words pride we feel really good about the overall mixing of the business. What weve done in the last two three years. But again we always see a little bit of a soft spot in terms of enterprise level in terms of up margin. I think youre right enterprise margins for Q3 will be around the 3.5 range. And again I compare that to last year which maybe its nonsense because of COVID its up substantially yearonyear. Im going off a memory but I got to believe that if we went back to fiscal 19 wed be up yearonyear in terms of Q3 to Q3 as well. So none of it has anything to do with reflection of the business other than for certain parts of our business as you know Q3 tends to be more of an investment quarter on an OpEx line than the other quarters. The thing that Im focused on more than anything is beginning of the year.,JBL,0.9830142259597778,0.9660284316709231,Positive
So weve had weve strung together I dont know adding four five years where the overall enterprise up margin line has been bouncing around 3.5. That says weve really been focused on adding good quality growth to the company. And in September we gave an outlook that said for the year we do a four handle on up margin. 90 days ago in December we took that up to four one now were taking that up to four two. So I feel Im more focused on that trajectory than the quarteronquarter results. And in terms of your comments forward looking beyond 21 well give more detail around that in the Investor Day in September I had said something in my prepared remarks today around the fact that were very focused on continuing a positive direction with margins as we get into fiscal 22. And that would be relative to the four two that we hope to post this year.,JBL,0.9950917959213256,0.9901835859916124,Positive
Got it. And maybe just as a follow up for Mike you talked about being able to plan to generate over 600 million of free cash flow this year wondering if thats also something that you can build on like Marks comments on operating margin as we think about a go forward basis or are there are CapEx investments to achieve that operating margin improvement And maybe you can just tie in your capital allocation priorities as you answer that question Thank you.,JBL,0.9999196529388428,0.9998393057819044,Positive
Thanks Adam. Yes definitely free cash flow will I think weve said more than 600 million for this year as we continue into FY 22. I expect that to continue to grow. Again weve said this before CapEx is something where weve been extremely disciplined in that 2.9 3 range. So free cash flows next year again well get guidance in September but I expect that to go up on a similar unraid ph as its done in FY 21. As relates to capital allocation Adam we continue to be sort of well balanced. We continue with our buybacks. I talked about our buybacks in my prepared remarks we have to earn 34 million left of our authorization we intend to complete their authorization in Q3 and Q4 or in the second half of the year. So that shows that were extremely committed to the buyback program. And that will continue into 22 23. I dont want to preempt anything now. But Im sure well be continuing that progress from a buyback standpoint. Most of the I think we laid out a few quarters ago the capital allocation percentages roughly half buys into buybacks dividends some of the balance of that goes into debt restructuring and the balance would be opportunistic sort of MA as well. So well balanced. Capital allocation continues going forward.,JBL,1.0,1.0,Positive
Very helpful. Thank you both.,JBL,0.994382381439209,0.9887647561816908,Positive
The next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you and good results. If I look at your updated guidance on the buy segments am I correct that the 5G wireless and cloud is the one that kind of is giving you the most surprise there And if so are any of your segments or all of them or any of them experiencing semiconductor shortages Are you able to procure all the components and items needed Thank you.,JBL,0.9798123836517334,0.9596247432379383,Positive
Thanks Jim. I assume youre talking about our eight sectors ph. Yes so Im not quite sure we mean in terms of surprise in terms of the uplift for sure. So I dont know that its a surprise to us that were seeing strength in 5G and cloud. Back in December we knew that there was going to be some component shortages and constraints. But weve been very bullish on the 5G wireless infrastructure and cloud area of our business. So whether surprised or not its certainly an area where we continue to see strength. And I think thats largely both on the 5G side and the cloud side. Our services and our solutions are being well accepted and embraced out in the marketplace. So feel really good about that area of the business. In terms of supply constraints I would say that we talked about this a bit in December lets say nine months ago or so. You know there was demand drops everywhere based on COVID. I think that people took a lot of their demand signals cut them abruptly. And then at least our conversations with our customers very few people anticipated the rebound that weve seen which largely started August September timeframe and a bit to our surprise is continued to be very strong through early stages of 2021. And on the supply side again all of that drove constraints.,JBL,0.9999983310699464,0.9999966621379033,Positive
One good piece of information I think to share is any type of supply constraints whether it be around resin whether it be around silicon whether it be around passives whether it be around mechanicals all thats handicapped into our numbers and I would actually say that we took a fairly deep handicap to that for our Q3 and Q4. So I feel if anything maybe theres some slight upsides to what weve put out today assuming that the supply constraints dont work and worse. And the other thing I would say is I think the procurement team at Jabil just simply the best team in the business. And if I think about our scale if I think about our holistic approach to demand planning whether that cuts across healthcare or mobility or EMS business or automotive our teams knowledge of the marketplace the knowledge of the commodities knowledge of technologies and in the long standing relationships we have is really allowing us to navigate what otherwise is a tough component market at the moment. So I feel were getting along and getting by quite well all things considered on a relative basis.,JBL,0.999775528907776,0.9995510575479614,Positive

The next question is from Steven Fox of Fox Advisors. Please proceed with your question.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks. Good morning. Two questions if I could please. First Mark could you just give a little more color on where the healthcare solutions businesses on its margin journey and how it did in the quarter You know maybe referencing back to when you first did the JJ ph deal and what you were thinking for next year And then secondly I just dont clear based on what you just said about constraints and potential inventory builds Mike youre talking about still doing 600 million in cash flow free cash flow is the difference between prior thinking just basically higher EBIT offset by more inventory investments or there other puts and takes. Thanks.,JBL,0.9999987483024596,0.9999974966034271,Positive

Hey Steve somehow you cut off.,JBL,0.2689248919486999,-0.4621510876125621,Negative
Sorry for breaking the conference call. Did you hear any of my questions Or should I repeat,JBL,0.019186645746231,-0.9616278777288664,Negative
If you could repeat them thatd be great.,JBL,0.9875485897064208,0.9750971645695949,Positive
Yes sure. So first question again was on the health care area. So if you can provide some color into how it performed during the quarter both top line and margin and where you are on the margin journey you know referencing back to when you first did the JJ deal And then secondly Im just trying to understand make sure I understand the that the cash flow target staying at 600 million plus you have higher EBIT but it sounds like higher inventory investments. Is that basically the puts and takes versus 90 days ago or is there anything else Thanks.,JBL,0.9954473972320556,0.9908947890369824,Positive
Yes thank you. So on the healthcare side I think were  I think we continue to hit it on all cylinders. Steve Borges ph and his team who run that business we started talking about the JJMD relationship. I dont even know how long ago now to 2.5 years ago we kind of laid out a roadmap there and our health care team has executed nearly flawlessly to the roadmap that we laid out. So feel good about that and then the business around the JJMD. And I talked in my prepared remarks about different trends. And the team is really focused on things like for health care like personalized health like digital health. We announced sometime during the quarter another relationship that has everything to do with technology around auto injection and auto injectors. And so I just look at the technology the investments that our healthcare teams are making and feel really good about that. Our healthcare and packaging business speed last year I think was in the neighborhood of 4.1 billion 4.2 billion. And I would guess as we exit this year health care and packaging well be bumping up against 5 billion. And I think well continue to see good solid growth in that area for the next two to three years.,JBL,0.8854040503501892,0.7708079640912795,Positive
In terms of the 600 million of cash flow its another number that I feel really good about and on the surface. Maybe its a little bit confusing because EBITDA is going up and margins are going up. So why wouldnt cash flow go up We have been working diligently to continue to shape the portfolio. Our number one focus as our leadership team is cash flows and management over the next two three four years. I think if we ever get to a point where as a leadership team we decide not to grow the company. That would be a perilous thing to do and makes no sense to us as long as were adding good quality business again attached to secular trends that allow us to continue to expand margins as we look at 22 and 23. So if I take you back to the beginning of the year we said we do 26.5 billion 27 billion in revenue. Now were bumping up against 28 billion 28.5 billion. And with the additional top line with the way the teams managing working capital the way the teams managing CapEx and then Mike alluded to the fact that we were going to complete our buyback authorization by August 31 of the year.,JBL,0.911084234714508,0.8221683634331005,Positive
So I think were being well balanced in terms of both capital investments OpEx investments and shareholders. I feel good about the 600 million plus. And then well give an update to what I think you should anticipate is stronger cash flows as we get into the Investor Day in September.,JBL,0.9991791248321532,0.9983582486857463,Positive

The next question is from Paul Coster of JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes thanks for taking my question. You talked earlier of a platform for better margins in the future. And theyre really improving. And Im just wondering Mark if you can talk about how much of this is structural in the industry itself And how much of it is under your control What is that you are doing today that makes you feel sure that youre locking in higher margins in sort of medium term,JBL,0.8231741786003113,0.6463481464076914,Positive
I dont know that its structural to our industry. I hope so. I think if our competition can lock in higher margins thats always good but were pretty inwardly focused Paul. I think about first and foremost we obsess about customer care and customer solutions. And I think if we dont get that out of order Paul and we continue to obsess about our customers and what they need in solving their issues the financials will follow. If I step back and I look at this fiscal year I was noticing something over the weekend this will be along with the margin trajectory I think this would be the first year weve ever had in the history of the company if we execute and thats a big capital if but if we execute were going to string together four consecutive quarters where every single quarter is at or exceeds 1 per share. And that just kind of jumped off the page. But in terms of margin expansion you asked about is it structural I think so. Thats our plan and thats what will allow us to take margins up from the 4.2 as we get into next year.,JBL,0.9974385499954224,0.9948770969373566,Positive
And I think about everything from our balance sheet if you take a look at and again now Im coming at it a little bit more from an EPS perspective. But since you asked the question around is it structural. Our balance sheet continues to improve net debts going down interest expense is going down. Overall liquidity has gone up. And then I take a look at the business and I look at things like I think we have very very good overhead and overhead costs I think about overall demand I think about the secular trends that weve talked about sometimes thats a really really overused term. But we are truly embedded in so many of those markets which I think are going to be around for the next two or three years. And then the whole COVID thing its not behind us yet. But with the vaccine being here we hope to have 70 80 of our employees globally have access to the vaccine over the next six to eight months. Its just and then I think lastly and weve been talking about this for 10 to 12 quarters is the mix of our businesses as healthy as its ever been.,JBL,0.843026876449585,0.6860535657725131,Positive
So I think you shake all that stuff up together. And again I take a look at the last couple years margins have been around 3.5. I think that theres a real opportunity here for us to on a structural basis increase margins by 100 basis points as we look forward after that 3.5 base.,JBL,0.9936811327934264,0.9873622580541717,Positive
Well maybe the follow up then Mark is what is it that youre not doing Are you able to it sounds like you had the choice of not doing some business because you could be satisfying your customers delighting them even but it could be bad business that youre doing ultimately from a margin perspective. So can you talk to us a little bit about how you shaped the portfolio and what you do at the front end to prevent low margin business coming in and hurting the overall business model,JBL,0.9436410665512084,0.8872820659172926,Positive
I think it starts with absolute clarity communication to the troops internally. You know I can tell you this Ive been with the company a long time. Right screw things up is when I have stuff in my head with the leadership team and we dont communicate it to the group. What I can tell you and the reciprocal of that is when the group understands where were going and why were going there and what our purpose is theres no better team there just isnt. And so people understand that theres two things that were focused on for the next two three four years and thats continued expansion of cash flows and continued expansion and margins. And by the way our portfolio we kind of refer to as a portfolio for a reason. We have some business that might be a little softer on the margin side but based on terms based on the business itself have tremendous cash flows. And we have other businesses that have tremendous margin but maybe the working capital is a little richer we have some of that in our healthcare space and other areas. But when you blend all that together I think theres just a picture here that were just starting to paint. And again we feel pretty good for the next two to three years.,JBL,0.990536093711853,0.9810721761418439,Positive
To answer your question directly. Were just going to stay away from bad business. And you know that that could mean a variety of things. But I think internally people are pretty clear on what were going to go after. Certainly if we can go after business where theres going to be positive trends going forward. Its goodness for everybody. But I think I think the organization is pretty clear about the type of businesses were not going to go after.,JBL,0.9996808171272278,0.9993616338739597,Positive
Thanks so much.,JBL,0.9845963716506958,0.9691927249388248,Positive
The next question is from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please proceed with your question.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a bit more into the 5G Wireless and cloud outlook the increase Im just curious to know specifically maybe you can give some more details on whats driving that and what Im trying to figure out is is this demand that would have come in the future but as being pulled in now as people start to ramp 5G Or are you seeing market share gains and actually end market growth because obviously the market is growing But how much of it has been driven by increased and demand overall And then I have a follow up. Thank you.,JBL,0.9982077479362488,0.9964154937359653,Positive
Shannon Id say and I dont want to be offensive by not getting into details. I would say this with a high degree of confidence. For sure were seeing stretch secular trends and trends that are very positive in terms of cloud and finally what looks to be reasonable plans in terms of the 5G Wireless rollout. So thats going to be helpful. And we think thats here to stay for not a number of months but a number of years. And by the way we think thats going to have all kinds of tangents tied to it as well once the 5G rollout gets underway in terms of derivatives to other parts of our business. And then I think I complement that with saying theres just been good acceptance of our solutions and our services in the space both on the design side I think Mike alluded to he was using some fancy terms around what we call a kind of designed to dust and repurposing older servers. And he did a nice job explaining it but it sounds a little I dont know overly technical or whatever. But when we talk about the design side all the way to repositioning and disposing of older hardware kind of front to back I think Shannon the solutions we have in that space. Again its still what I would call early days but had been received quite well. And I would also suggest that there is some market share wins in there as well.,JBL,0.9999966025352478,0.9999932050664455,Positive
Great that was helpful. And then my second question is just on stimulus if you think back to last summer and maybe what you I know its somewhat hard to determine how much benefit you guys saw directly from stimulus but how are you thinking about it when you gave us the guidance for this year in terms of the checks that are going to be hitting in the next few weeks Thank you.,JBL,0.9643394947052002,0.9286789468997401,Positive
Yes thanks. Let me break up the back half of 21 with 22 and 23. I cant make sense of the US equity markets anymore because I dont know how they got detached from fundamentals in so many ways. I just think that when you put 4 trillion of stimulus into the system and theres dollars everywhere they got to go somewhere. I think that stimulus will be a bit of a driver for the next couple quarters maybe into 1Q of 22. But the nice thing is so as we navigate 21 I see two things. I see certain parts of our business being driven by what I would call COVID type behaviors some of those will dissipate some of those maintain. I see certain parts of our business that are stimulusrelated. In certain parts of the United States right now you go and you try to buy a truck or car an appliance whatever it may be there is backlogs everywhere and I think thats stimulus related. But as the impact of stimulus and the impact of COVID start to attenuate a bit and fall off of it I think whats right behind that is kind of  no kidding no nonsense secular trends. And again Mike talked about it I talked about it in our prepared remarks and I think those specific trends certainly will be a driver for our business the next two three four years so its not like Im sitting here going geez when stimulus abates ph when COVID types of hardware either go away or reduce  that there is not going to be other elements that continue to give us a little bit of an uplift. So I dont know if that helps or gets at your question but thats how I see it.,JBL,0.1131017506122589,-0.7737975560412145,Negative
Yes very helpful. Thank you very much.,JBL,0.9914112091064452,0.9828224079742478,Positive

The next question is from Matt Sheerin of Stifel. Please proceed with your question.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes thank you and good morning. Mark your commentary across endmarkets extremely positive one area that youre still guiding down yearoveryear as networking and storage. Looks like you took that up a little bit from 2.3 billion to 2.4 billion but still down. Could you tell us what youre seeing in that market Is there still weakness in onprim spend and expectations of that improving as the recovery continues postCOVID,JBL,0.8307104706764221,0.6614207395438787,Positive
Yes sure. So the network storage business was around 2.8 billion in fiscal 20. September we took that all the way down to 2.2 billion and again thats a reflection of a couple of things its a reflection of some of the legacy business may be starting to lose footing and lose a little traction out in the marketplace. Number two is again as we continue to think about our portfolio for fiscal 22 and 23 there are certain areas of that business that when we think about our overall invested capital might not make sense for us any longer but the nice thing is from the September timeframe to December timeframe to today weve actually been on a trajectory back up. So thats nothing more than A we have tremendous relationships with certain customers in that space and well continue to serve those customers serve them well and as long as theyll have us and appreciate the value we provide were all in. And  so I  again I think about 2.8 billion in 20 to down 2.2 billion in the last  I think December and today weve taken it back up by 200 million roughly. And I would just look at  Id look at network and storage as a  a very key element of our eight sector makeup. And I would say that even though in some of those businesses margins might be tight cash flows are quite good so its a very good complement to the other seven sectors.,JBL,0.0215571522712707,-0.9568868618529213,Negative
Matt Sheeran,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay thank you for that. And then just a question regarding your packaging initiatives particularly the ecofriendly initiatives you just announced a big paper bottle solutions investment and plan. Could you talk more about that the opportunity And how important is that in terms of a growth driver for Jabil,JBL,0.9984613060951232,0.9969226103559792,Positive
Well wont be much of a growth driver this year. We have to be very very very selective in our MA. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders but at the same time and I made this comment around growth you know if we ever get to a point where were not growing the company then shame on us but we have to do so in a marginfriendly cash flowfriendly way which is I think what I hope this years results will start to prove out. And as part of that the good news is almost all of our material growth is organic which is the best growth to have by two magnitudes but we will continue to complement that with select MA activity and for us to put some dollars in play with the acquisition youre talking about is a wonderful company with wonderful people and great leadership a company called Ecologic. We are very excited about the platform that theyve developed and we always ask ourselves the question when were looking at acquisitions we start with culture alignment we start with capability and competency and then what are we going to do with the business when we own it strategically. We have a wonderful roadmap internally around sustainable packaging and this is kind of a second or third step for us we believe that well be able to take that technology and as we look towards fiscal 22 fiscal 23 give that technology  its due in terms of further RD and then giving that technology exposure to maybe bigger brands that we support based on our balance sheet our scale and our relationships.,JBL,0.9999986886978148,0.9999973773940665,Positive

The next question is from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.,JBL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. The companys doing very well on margins and guiding to 4.2 for this year despite what I would think are some temporary cost headwinds related to the supply chain environment including the shipping cost as the most important component shortages that the whole industry is having to deal with. Can you talk about how much of a headwind the company may be seeing from some of those supply chain types of costs this year And if we were to add that back do you think thats more representative of the underlying margin levels that the company can hopefully build off of going forward Or are there any other temporal factors that we should be thinking about thats influencing margins this year,JBL,0.94944965839386,0.8988992565269809,Positive
Thanks Mark. You know I  geez ph I said earlier weve  weve certainly handicapped the business for Q3 and Q4 and I think our handicap has been appropriate. So I think that in and of itself might suggest that  you know if we didnt handicap the business maybe margins would be 4.3 for the year I wouldnt get much ahead of that. But I also mentioned earlier Mark the method to our madness in terms of supply chain management its wonderful. And just listening to others either a few customers suppliers or folks in our industry were navigating this thing beautifully and its a tough deal but the impact to us I think will be minimal on a relative basis. And again as we sit here today we had a debrief from our entire procurement team last week and we feel like this thing will start to show levels of relief as we get into 1Q of 2022 and for sure as we get into calendar 2022. So to frame out that timeframe call it September October November timeframe well start seeing relief. And then I think things will be back to more normal conditions call it January February March of 2022.,JBL,1.0,1.0,Positive
With that said again we gave the guidance we gave to today for Q3 and Q4 and I suddenly feel confident. And as I mentioned earlier when you look at margins at 4.2 ph for the year I think  I think were going to continue to effort to have an upward trajectory of that as we get into 2022 even with considerations of nearterm supply changes.,JBL,0.9614505171775818,0.9229009884005717,Positive
Thats very helpful. My followup question was on the EV opportunity and automotive has been a growing business for Jabil and an area I realized that Jabil has a lot of capabilities already Foxconn is moving to divert or brought it out its business in doing full electric vehicle architectures and even final car assembly. Im interested if thats the type of business that Jabil would also consider expanding into within the automotive and EV space Thanks.,JBL,0.2228001356124878,-0.5544006552700134,Negative
I think its a part right ph to think that well set up automotive factories. The capital intensity that is enormous and I dont want our people focused away from what we do really really well which is sensors components subassemblies for the entire automotive space and thank you for the compliment on that we do have a very good track record in automotive. One of the strategic decisions we made two and a half three years ago was  is all hands on in terms of really focusing hard on electrification and EV not just with automobiles but all the transportation and I think that  I think that decision is paying dividends to us. When you think about the term electrification that would suggest right in our core and the RD dollars and the investments weve made in that area have been substantial so I feel pretty good about how were positioned there and well see how that plays out for 22 and 23. If I had to speculate make a little bit of a guess today I think today we look at that the  the Hsector ph chart and  in FY 20 automotive transport was about 1.7 billion in September we took that up to 1.9 billion. Were sitting here today saying it will be a bit over 2.2 billion. And I would  if I had to venture a guess today I would say the trajectory of that sector as we move through 22 is going to continue to be up and to the right.

On todays call I will provide a summary of our results and then Bryan Knutson our Chief Operating Officer will give an overview for each of our business segments. Mark Kalvoda our CFO will then review financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2021 and conclude with some commentary around our fiscal 2022 modeling assumptions.,TITN,0.9999606609344482,0.9999213218220007,Positive
If you turn to slide three you will see an overview of our fourth quarter and full year financial results. We generated fourth quarter revenue of 436.7 million which exceeded our expectations increasing 24 versus prior year due to the strong sales in our Agriculture and Construction segments.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The stronger revenue combined with lower interest expense resulted in a 5.6 million increase in our adjusted pretax income to 6.8 million and a significant lift in our adjusted earnings per diluted share to 0.23 compared to just 0.02 last year.,TITN,0.9390175342559814,0.8780349958151554,Positive
This strong finish in the fourth quarter made for an exceptional year in what is otherwise considered to be a challenging operating environment with the welldocumented complexities associated with the COVID pandemic.,TITN,0.868034839630127,0.7360695219454301,Positive
We are extremely proud of our accomplishments and our financial results demonstrate our teams commitment to stay focused on our customers who are working in the fields and on job sites.,TITN,0.9529858827590942,0.90597170947296,Positive
Weve generated full year revenue of 1.41 billion which was up 8.1 compared to fiscal 2020. Our adjusted pretax income grew 52.5 to 38.1 million versus 25 million for the prior year driving adjusted EPS of 1.26 compared to 0.84 last year.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

On slide 4 is an overview of our domestic Agriculture segment. We are seeing much improved farmer sentiment due to the progressive strength in commodity prices through our fourth quarter and continuing to date.,TITN,0.8158753514289856,0.631750483364155,Positive
In addition to the stronger commodity prices favorable yields in much of our ag footprint combined with USDA payments led to improved net farm income for calendar year 2020. Additionally fall harvest conditions were ideal for most of our farm and ranch customers to get their fields in great shape for the upcoming spring planting season.,TITN,0.9934195280075072,0.9868390481704759,Positive
Our business is well positioned to support the aging fleet of equipment with our focused parts and service strategy. We continue to pursue consistent growth in parts and service revenue which is supporting strong gross profit margins and a healthy pretax income contribution.,TITN,0.9995741844177246,0.9991483683278373,Positive
In addition to the stronger net farm income and improved farmer sentiment we continue to see replacement demand precision technology and connected machines as ongoing catalysts for new equipment purchases. As a result we anticipate the momentum within our ag segment to continue throughout our fiscal 2022.,TITN,0.999896764755249,0.999793529387432,Positive
Turning to slide 5 you will see an overview of our domestic construction segment. Although our construction equipment segment continues to feel the economic impact of COVID we are seeing improving industry trends due to low interest rates economic stabilization net farm income growth improved oil prices and continued optimism for future infrastructure investment.,TITN,0.8671099543571472,0.7342197502969208,Positive

Late in the fiscal fourth quarter we divested two of our CE stores in Phoenix and Tucson Arizona. Not only will this be advantageous to our CE segment profitability but also supports our strategy of operating and acquiring locations in core markets where we can leverage logistics similar equipment specifications and customer synergies.,TITN,0.9669023752212524,0.933804710987038,Positive
Before we turn to slide 6 International overview I want to share a couple of comments on the ERP implementation which impacts our domestic ag and CE business. We have been successfully operating one pilot store in our new ERP platform since July 2020 with an expected full rollout in the next 12 months.,TITN,0.7540394067764282,0.5080785203448059,Positive
With the calendar year 2020 COVID challenges along with additional ERP development we are experiencing an extension of our original time line resulting in some additional fiscal 2022 expenses that will be incurred which Mark will discuss later.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Now moving to slide 6 we have an overview of our International segment which represents our business within the countries of Bulgaria Germany Romania Serbia and Ukraine.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In addition to COVIDrelated disruptions our International segment is being impacted by extremely dry weather in Romania and parts of Bulgaria and Ukraine which negatively affected summer and fall crop yields.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The sentiment of the European farmer is improving due to improved global commodity prices and the winter crops receiving some muchneeded moisture creating a better outlook as our customers approach the 2021 growing season.,TITN,0.1641963720321655,-0.6716082522918299,Negative
We continue to focus on the parts and service areas of our International business as customers in these developing markets are looking for higher levels of product support as equipment becomes more sophisticated and technologically advanced.,TITN,0.9865840673446656,0.9731681186962837,Positive
As with our North American ag business new equipment demand is being driven by precision technology and connected machines and the performance and reliability of modern farm machinery.,TITN,0.2361243367195129,-0.5277522371722683,Negative
Before I turn the call over to Mark Id like to thank all of our employees for a very successful fiscal 2021. In the face of adversity our employees stepped up and outperformed at all levels of the organization producing outstanding results while supporting our customers and their operations.,TITN,0.990986943244934,0.9819738757454606,Positive
With that I will turn the call over to Mark to review our financial results in more detail.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks Bryan. Turning to Slide 7. Our total revenue for the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter was 436.7 million an increase of 24.4 compared to last year. Exceptional strength in our equipment business was the main driver of the strong revenue results in our fourth quarter which increased 34.7. While we experienced solid equipment growth in both our Agriculture and Construction segments Agriculture was particularly strong due to the improved end market conditions Bryan discussed earlier.,TITN,0.9989217519760132,0.9978435026666539,Positive
As I mentioned on the call  on the last call we had very difficult comps for our fourth quarter parts and service businesses where parts and service were up 19.2 and 16.6 respectively due to the very difficult harvest conditions. This past falls harvest was quite different as weather conditions allowed for a much quicker harvest with less stress on equipment. As a result parts sales were down 4.7 and service was up 4.5 in our current year fourth quarter.,TITN,0.0019880235195159,-0.9960251426846641,Negative
Our rental and other revenue remained under pressure due to headwinds within our Construction segment and decreased 28.8 in the fourth quarter. As a result we experienced a 260 basis point compression in our rental fleet dollar utilization from 25 in the fourth quarter last year to 22.4 in the current quarter. Rental revenue was also down due to a smaller fleet size where we ended the year at 77.5 million compared to 104.1 million in the prior period.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
On Slide 8 our gross profit for the quarter increased by 10.8 to 67.7 million due to the significant increase in our revenue. But the mix of sales which favored equipment caused our gross profit margin to decrease by 190 basis points to 15.5. Our operating expenses were essentially flat at 60.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.,TITN,0.848827600479126,0.697655020746601,Positive
Flat expenses coupled with the strong revenue growth we experienced generated significant operating leverage during the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 320 basis points to 13.9 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 17.1 of revenue in the prior year period.,TITN,0.9693814516067504,0.938762866713325,Positive
Impairment costs were 400000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 3.6 million in the prior year. Floorplan and other interest expense decreased 1 million to 1.5 million compared to the same period last year. The decrease was due to a lower interest rate environment a lower interest rate spread under our new amended credit agreement that was finalized in April 2020 and lower borrowings on our line of credit.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we realized adjusted net income of 5.3 million compared to 600000 for the prior year quarter. Our adjusted fourth quarter fiscal 2021 net income excludes a 3.3 million charge for Ukraine income tax valuation allowance adjustments while the prior year figure excludes a 4.6 million benefit for domestic income tax valuation adjustments.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was 0.23 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 compared to 0.02 in the fourth quarter last year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 adjusted EBITDA increased 69.1 to 13.7 million which compares to 8.1 million in the prior year. You can find a reconciliation of adjusted net income adjusted income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP amounts in the appendix to the slide presentation.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
On Slide 9 you will see an overview of our segment results for the fourth quarter. Agriculture segment sales increased 40.7 to 303.2 million which drove a significant increase in our adjusted pretax income to 8 million in the fourth quarter which is a 5.5 million improvement from the 2.5 million we generated last year. Strong equipment sales combined with lower floor plan interest expense drove the robust increase in adjusted pretax income.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to our Construction segment revenue increased 1.9 to 88.9 million compared to the prior year period. Lower operating expenses combined with lower interest costs drove a 1.6 million improvement in segment adjusted pretax income to 600000 compared to a pretax loss of 1 million in the same period last year.,TITN,0.1627967357635498,-0.6744075264975586,Negative
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 our International segment revenue was 44.6 million. The decline of 7.5 compared to the prior year period was the result of lower equipment revenue caused by the industry conditions Bryan discussed earlier partially offset by an increase in parts and service revenue.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The overall lower revenues caused our adjusted pretax loss to increase 400000 to 2.7 million compared to 2.3 million in the prior year. Turning to slide 10 you will see an overview of our full year revenue results.,TITN,0.0314322412014007,-0.9371366722206309,Negative
Fiscal 2021 total revenue increased 8.1 compared to last year driven by 10.8 growth in equipment revenue and was further supported by solid contributions from our parts and service businesses which were both strong contributors through the first nine months of the year and finished up 4.5 and 8.1 respectively for the full year.,TITN,0.229057490825653,-0.5418859373843299,Negative
Rental and other was down 20.8 due to the smaller fleet and lower dollar utilization. On slide 11 our full year gross profit was 261.4 million a 4.2 increase compared to the prior year while our gross profit margin decreased 70 basis points to 18.5.,TITN,0.1618943512439727,-0.6762122966124398,Negative
Similar to the dynamics we realized in our fourth quarter we also see the effects of the strong equipment revenue growth driving gross profit dollars but diluting overall margins due to mix.,TITN,0.9901052713394164,0.9802105308833899,Positive
Operating expenses decreased by 4.9 million or 2.2 for the full year of fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year period. We were successful in decreasing our operating expenses during the year primarily due to expense reductions in our Construction segment as well as benefiting from lower operating costs caused by the pandemic.,TITN,0.0174236297607421,-0.9651539118015242,Negative
As a result of lower expenses and higher revenues operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 170 basis points to 15.6 in fiscal 2021. Impairment costs decreased 600000 to 3.2 million in the current full year period compared to 3.8 million in the prior year.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Floor plan and other interest expense decreased 2.6 million or 26.8 due to a lower interest rate environment a lower interest rate spread under our amended credit agreement and overall lower borrowing levels.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the full year fiscal 2021 our adjusted net income was 28.2 million an increase of 51.5 from the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was 1.26 for fiscal 2021 representing a 50 increase compared to 0.84 in the prior year.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For fiscal 2021 adjusted EBITDA grew 24.6 to 65.4 million compared to 52.5 million in fiscal 2020. Turning to slide 12 we provide our segment results for the full year fiscal 2021.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Overall our adjusted pretax income increased 52.5 to 38.1 million for the full year. This improvement was largely due to the strength of our Agriculture segment we discussed earlier. But we are also happy to see our Construction segment achieve profitability despite lower revenues.,TITN,0.9028845429420472,0.805768970113379,Positive
Our Construction segment team continues to build off of focused initiatives which we believe will enable us to achieve sustained future profitability in this segment. The Ag and Construction results were modestly offset by the top and bottom line softness in our International segment.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to slide 13. Here we provide an overview of our balance sheet highlights at the end of the year. We had cash of 79 million as of January 31 2021 which is higher than normal due to the very strong cash generation in fiscal year 2021 that I will discuss in a few minutes. Our equipment inventory at the end of fiscal 2021 was 338.1 million a decrease of 177.8 million from January 31 2020. This substantial decrease in both new and used equipment inventories was a result of strong endofyear equipment sales combined with inventory that was sold in the divestiture of our Phoenix and Tucson Arizona locations which also occurred in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Strong sales combined with lower inventory levels accelerated our equipment inventory turns to 2.0 in fiscal 2021 from 1.5 in the prior year. I will provide a little more color on our inventory on the next slide.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our rental fleet assets at the end of the fourth quarter decreased to 77.5 million compared to 104.1 million at the end of fiscal 2020. In addition to the defleeting earlier in the year we also sold rental fleet assets as part of our fourth quarter divestiture of the two Arizona construction stores. We anticipate our fleet size to increase slightly by the end of fiscal 2022 to around 80 million.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
As of January 31 2021 we have 161.8 million of outstanding floor plan payables on 773 million of floor plan lines of credit which leaves us with considerable capacity in our credit lines to handle our equipment financing needs. Our adjusted debttotangible net worth ratio is a strong 1.0 compared to 1.3 in the prior year period and is wellbelow 3.5 which is the leverage covenant requirement of our two largest floor plan facilities outside our bank syndicate and credit agreement.,TITN,0.0106200277805328,-0.9787611238724733,Negative
Turning to slide 14. The amount of new and used equipment inventories are reflected in the size of the red and blue bars on the slide. As I mentioned strong fourth quarter sales combined with the divestiture drove a 151.7 million decrease in new equipment and a 26.1 million decrease in used equipment as compared to January 31 2020 generating the higher equipment turn of 2.0.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic and strong customer demand particularly in agriculture has created an overall tighter industry supply of equipment. Our equipment orders level of presales and used equipment inventory have us wellpositioned to meet our revenue targets for fiscal year 2022. Given the lower inventory starting point for the year and the strong end market in ag we expect our inventory turn will continue to increase throughout fiscal 2022.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The overall quality of our inventory remains very healthy. Our inventory under noninterest bearing terms which can be seen by the gray bar on the slide ended the year at 29.2 reflecting a higher mix of International inventory compared to that of the prior year. We have longer noninterest bearing terms available with domestic inventory purchases than we do with purchases in our International business. When procurement levels increase in fiscal 2022 we would expect to see this noninterest bearing percentage rise as well.,TITN,0.2483206391334533,-0.5033596178052533,Negative
Slide 15 provides an overview of our operating cash flows for fiscal years 2021 and 2020. The GAAP reported cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2021 was 173 million compared to 1 million last year. As part of our adjusted cash flow provided by operating activities we include all our equipment inventory financing including nonmanufacturer floor plan activity and adjust our cash flow to reflect the constant equity in our equipment inventory allowing us to evaluate operating cash flows exclusive of changes in equipment inventory financing decisions.,TITN,0.1189887225627899,-0.7620236051223309,Negative
After applying these adjustments our adjusted cash provided by operating activities was a record 148.5 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to 17.8 million in the prior year. Solid bottomline performance combined with good working capital management including the reduction of equipment inventory I just discussed drove this robust cash flow metric.,TITN,0.8554788827896118,0.710957593296524,Positive
This strong cash generation has allowed us to pay off all of our domestic interestbearing credit lines and end fiscal year 2021 with cash on the balance sheet of 79 million. We have never generated this level of cash flow before and our balance sheet has never been stronger.,TITN,0.7958388328552246,0.5916774223312273,Positive
On slide 16 we are introducing our fiscal 2022 full year modeling assumptions. Our business is performing well and we are bullish on our prospects this fiscal year given the improving macro backdrop particularly in ag. However we believe areas of our business could continue to be impacted by the challenging global economy due to COVID creating a higher degree of uncertainty in these assumptions compared to a normal environment.,TITN,0.9602402448654176,0.9204804423334854,Positive
For the Agriculture segment our initial assumption is for revenue growth in the range of up 10 to 15 which compares to our fiscal 2021 performance where we generated growth of 18.3. The fiscal 2022 growth range includes a full year revenue contribution from our HorizonWest acquisition that closed in May 2020.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the Construction segment our initial assumption is for revenue to decrease in the range of flat to down 5. Impacting this assumption is the divestment of our two construction equipment stores in Arizona at the end of fiscal 2021 which accounted for approximately 27 million of combined revenue.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Excluding these revenues from the prior year base our assumption results in a samestore sales range of up 3 to 8. This divestiture reduces invested capital and will further strengthen the bottomline results of our Construction segment.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the International segment our initial assumption is for revenue growth in the range of up 12 to 17. This segment is coming off a very challenged fiscal 2021 where the pandemic and weather weighed on revenues. Our assumption anticipates transitioning back to a more normal operating environment with some strength anticipated from higher global agriculture commodity prices.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
From a diluted earnings per share perspective we are introducing a fiscal 2022 range of 1.25 to 1.45. This range now includes all ERP implementation expenses and in addition to normal variable expense increases on higher revenues anticipates expenses rising as we transition to a postpandemic business environment and incur higher costs in areas like travel fuel and employee medical expenses.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Considering these variables we would not expect to see as much operating expense leverage on increased sales as we normally would but still estimate our expenses as a percent of revenue will improve slightly relative to fiscal 2021.,TITN,0.8404631614685059,0.6809261327541665,Positive
Regarding tax we anticipate an effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 of approximately 29. We still expect this rate will vary quartertoquarter as profit and loss mix fluctuates due to seasonality within our various international tax jurisdictions where corporate tax rates vary and valuation allowances exist. We will update you as necessary on our tax rate expectations as we progress through the year.,TITN,0.7655565738677979,0.5311128682570865,Positive
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator we are now ready for the questionandanswer session of our call.,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
QuestionandAnswer Session,TITN,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. Operator Instructions Our first question comes from the line of Rick Nelson with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.,TITN,0.995206356048584,0.9904127063826957,Positive
Thanks Mark. Good morning. Id like to  I guess focus on inventory the big reduction. We saw improved turns. You referenced some supply chain challenges. If you could speak to that and when you think inventories will normalize And I guess the implications for margins right when supplies are tight do you think that theres more pricing flexibility,TITN,0.9997708201408386,0.9995416400084733,Positive
Sure. Thanks Rick. This is Bryan. We do have as we mentioned a good inflow of presales coming in a nice amount of latemodel used inventory on hand. Lease returns that will be coming back throughout the year as well as our current inventories and then our Q4 order book that opens soon here. So were positioned well. We feel good. Obviously there are some supply chain disruptions as you mentioned a lot of them due to COVID some of them due to the fairly rapid uptick in the commodity prices. But yes that will potentially help margins as well.,TITN,0.999999463558197,0.9999989271157546,Positive
A lot of the growers are aware of the longer lead times. Of course the manufacturers are ramping up production. And so again we feel were pretty well positioned there and looking to capitalize on that as we mentioned also the improved inventory turns that can come along with that.,TITN,0.9782425165176392,0.9564850070983213,Positive
Great. So equipment margins this quarter were relatively flat with last year. Is it possible to separate or can you comment on what youre seeing on the new equipment side and the used equipment side,TITN,0.9016018509864808,0.8032035846731573,Positive
Yes I can take that Rick. This is Mark. Yes and I think this kind of goes for next year as well. So with the higher level of revenues that were expecting on the new what happens is that some of these biggerticket items the combines the fourwheel drives. So even in a tighter environment those bigticket items typically dont garner the same level of margins that some of the smaller lowerpriced equipment is. So that is a little bit of the lower results for the quarter was on that and some of our expectations for next year.,TITN,0.8744277954101562,0.7488554411264903,Positive
Overall I think we can improve those equipment margins a little bit but theres going to be  because of the tighter environment that you referenced. And particularly on used some  should be able to see some nicer margins on used. But from a new standpoint well be somewhat held back because of those higherticket items making up a larger mix of what were selling.,TITN,0.8881036639213562,0.7762071944518056,Positive
Okay. So how  your inventory turns two times. I believe your objective or targets have been two to three times. How do you see that shaking out in fiscal 22 Would we potentially be at the upper end or even above your targets given the tight supply situation,TITN,0.9355498552322388,0.8710996336338721,Positive
Yes. So its hard to know exactly how thats all going to play out with the timing of the  with the inventories coming in. But overall with the lower inventory levels to start the year and the strong end markets particularly in ag I could easily see us approaching that 2.5 this year. But again I think it somewhat depends on the timing of that inflow of the equipment.,TITN,0.0025354027748107,-0.9949303835215472,Negative
I guess just to follow up on that comment. What are you hearing in terms of the ability to source that equipment What the timing as to when you think things would normalize,TITN,0.8358371257781982,0.6716740558588838,Positive
Generally more towards Q4 most of it is baked through this point. Again weve got a good level of presales through that point. And CNH and the other manufacturers have been ramping up quite a bit. So yes generally into the Q4 time period.,TITN,0.9984251260757446,0.9968502502740921,Positive
Great. Thanks for the time and color and good luck as we push forward.,TITN,0.998416543006897,0.996833084126165,Positive
Thanks Rick.,TITN,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry De Maria with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.,TITN,0.9936803579330444,0.987360708332484,Positive
Thanks. Good morning everybody. Wanted to start off construction question. I mean I dont think anybody expects your fiscal 22 and this calendar 2021 to be huge construction year per se but still looks a little conservative given the segments like housing and ag which you play into look a bit more favorable. So whats holding that back And I would think we have  obviously have an easier comp on the energy side too which could potentially be a little bit better. So whats holding back better construction performance at this point,TITN,0.9976529479026794,0.995305893007453,Positive
Well yes this is Dave Larry. I think we are guiding pretty much in line with what were hearing from the industry. And our targets are the small to midsized construction equipment which is  tends to  I think the expectation a little bit higher. But infrastructure builds too. A lot of unknowns in there and the timing of when that could potentially happen with the stuff. So again I think were guiding pretty much in line with the industry and were optimistic into that segment. But its a little bit going to be a timing on both the COVID and the oil starting to pick up. Theres still a little bit of caution out there and how long is that going to last And where is all this energy going to go So I think in the most part were in line and were optimistic.,TITN,0.0415689349174499,-0.9168632727046447,Negative
Okay. Thanks. And obviously we expect to sell out a new ag equipment this year more so than in a while. Can you talk about the conversations I know you mentioned technology upgrades but we have an old fleet. And when growers are coming in to buy equipment are they coming in more for the tech upgrades or more because they need to replace older equipment And also can you talk about take rates on these higher tech piece of equipment this season versus maybe last season How much more of that higher tech stuff are they taking this year,TITN,0.1021534502506256,-0.7956941698158799,Negative
Yes. Thanks Larry. This is Bryan. It is a mix of tax purchasing as well as upgrading older equipment to more efficient equipment and then also the technology. So really a mix of all those technology is a big driver. Were getting higher take rates as you mentioned. Some of the things like the harvest command has become an extremely high take rate which automatically adjusts the combine for the conditions to optimize the combine.,TITN,0.9951741099357604,0.9903482141186082,Positive
Also our soil command is increasing take rate quite rapidly adjusting the tillage to make a better seed bin. A lot of the precision planning components have also been a very high take rate and growing as well. And then steering and precision have a very high take rate as well. So  and then the connected machines the telematics also continues to really ramp up. So theres a lot of drivers on the technology side that we continue to see that ongoing throughout the year.,TITN,0.996330976486206,0.9926619485985926,Positive
So with that in mind  thats really helpful. Two followup questions to that. First is if youre selling more bigger expensive equipment that has all this extra technology shouldnt you be able to capture more margin or is CNH capturing that And with this telematics and connected machines how does this going to impact your aftermarket capture rates That impact mix for the positive over the next few years,TITN,0.8672919869422913,0.7345838156842086,Positive
Yes. And there are a couple of components to it too Larry. Theres the initial transactional price of it and  which again is a driver of the purchase right now and then the ongoing revenues associated with it. So anywhere from annual subscription fees that the farmer pays to get that data as well as the other things that telematics can do for our parts and service business allowing us to really help the grower and help the contractor with their uptime and just keep the machine going preventive maintenance and then helping us to really partner with them and make them more profitable. So there are several additional revenue streams there through the precision and the parts and service side as well for us.,TITN,0.999980926513672,0.9999618530046066,Positive
Okay. But it just seems like CNH is not sharing as much on this higher tech stuff and keeping more than theyre letting you guys do with selling it. I dont know if thats right or not but it seems like you should be capturing more margin upfront if you guys are selling all these higher tech piece of equipment and software upgrades,TITN,0.1355976462364196,-0.7288057379756798,Negative
Yeah yeah. I think an opportunity that were really excited about is the ongoing incremental revenue opportunities again through subscriptions and through the additional revenue sources that it provides for us with parts and service will be a couple of examples of that.,TITN,0.956372082233429,0.912744112458296,Positive
Okay. Thank you.,TITN,0.9836810827255248,0.9673621459973727,Positive
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.,TITN,0.9936803579330444,0.987360708332484,Positive
Good morning to everyone. I want to continue with Larrys train of thought here. Youre talking about this kind of life cycle opportunity that you have given precision technology and so on being added to the machine. But as you ran your own analysis on this is there a way for us to understand how much higher is the opportunity on service and maybe parts and maintenance on these upgraded machines versus equipment that was not smart for lack of a better term I mean is it 10 higher opportunity over the life of the machine Is it 20 Is it 50 How would you describe it,TITN,0.9992977976799012,0.9985955945227116,Positive
Hey good morning Mig. Weve got the additional parts and service opportunity. And then as we go forward our Titan tech support teams will continue to offer the tech support services. So I dont have specific numbers for you at this time in terms of will that incrementally drive our parts business 10 per se or whatever. It is difficult to break down always with that parts purchase or service purchase specifically due to the technology or replacement or walk in et cetera. So at the point of sale we dont specifically break down our purchase  our parts purchases as an example like that.,TITN,0.999995231628418,0.9999904632511516,Positive
No I mean I understand that. But I would imagine just like you say right theres going to be a support revenue stream here associated with this equipment. Its more complex. Its perhaps less userfriendly without the proper support from the dealer. So I think were all trying to understand as the industry is evolving here what your part in this ecosystem is and how youre going to be profiting and benefiting from it. I think that all of us are really kind of asking the same question.,TITN,0.8294764757156372,0.6589527481512714,Positive
Yeah. And frankly were probably in the same boat with you there. But were  we believe it definitely makes the customer stickier to us. Were adding resources to handle the tech support side of it to drive the sales of it. We are optimistic again to what itll do for our parts and service. It just has been difficult to model out at this point exactly what impact it will have on parts and service as an example for us.,TITN,0.0461794137954711,-0.9076423094524799,Negative
Well when you do have a model out I think wed love  all love to hear it. Mark a question for you maybe. Its interesting that youre no longer excluding your ERPrelated costs. So Im curious as to why youve made that decision. Im also curious as to what you anticipate these costs are going to be in fiscal 2022,TITN,0.9869438409805298,0.9738876663968958,Positive
Yeah. So Mig weve been adjusting these ERP transition costs out now for the last two years. And were close here closing in on the full implementation. So yeah we just decided to put this in our  not just adjust these out put them into our regular operating costs here. Some of the incremental costs that were going to be incurring this year as we get close to the golive is going to be internal resources to help in the training and support and those type of things. And those are the type of things that we wouldnt be adjusting out anyways or we havent adjusted out in the past.,TITN,0.0096375644207,-0.9807260517633272,Negative
Last year what you can see in our tables there that we did adjust out was a little over  I think it was a little over 3 million or about 3 million or 0.11. Wed expect that to ramp up a little bit this next year just for the reasons I said and put more internal resources to this again for training support after golive and going into the golive that type of thing. So call it another 1 million 1.5 million. So roughly around probably 4.5 million is what were looking at for like incremental ERP costs over last year is what was in the adjusted numbers.,TITN,0.984259307384491,0.968518596004603,Positive
Okay. All right. Then if I may I want to ask a question on construction. Maybe I missed this but the two dealerships that youve divested it was implied there that this is going to be margin positive with them being gone. Can you give us a sense for what these two dealerships how much of a drag maybe they were to your fiscal 2021 or the benefit that we could get from margin from just these two being gone in 2022,TITN,0.0115904808044433,-0.9768202166677814,Negative
Yes. It gets a little tricky to answer that. I mean we allocate out SRC or our corporate expenses here to those locations. With allocating those expenses out on those stores did lose like maybe 0.5 million something like that. But they did absorb some of the corporate costs. So taking that out it wouldnt be that much. But it was overall like I said with SRC allocation out there it was about 0.5 million.,TITN,0.7864424586296082,0.5728846626786368,Positive
Okay. It kind of begs the question on construction here. Were starting to see some growth. As somebody was pointing out earlier maybe your guidance is conservative in terms of how youre thinking about samestore sales for 2022. But look the margin in construction is still not probably where you want it to be. Can you remind us what the longterm vision is here I mean what are you guys working towards Im presuming that its more than 0.3. And how do we get there,TITN,0.141412079334259,-0.7171768648486525,Negative
Well so Mig our strategy here is to really grow that parts and service business around that Construction business. And I think weve made some really good progress in that area. And also focus on the key products I mean when you look at construction youve got a huge range. Youve got aggregate. Youve got the really heavy mining stuff. Youve got the really large roll building equipment. Then theyre more of our target space.,TITN,0.995674729347229,0.9913494535383305,Positive
Were targeting the homebuilders the commercial building a lot of the subcontractors your landscape people and stuff like that. So they really focus on that sweet spot where weve got some I think some really solid progress. Weve got heritage legacy. We have backhoes miniexcavators some of the midsized wheel orders to focus on that product.,TITN,0.1283269822597503,-0.7433470745963304,Negative
And then as I see as we get into some of our core footprint where we got some of the  farmers use a lot of ag equipment and the ranchers. All your feed lots all your seed and chemicals start to come in cold. So youre looking at skid steer loaders allterrain forklifts land improvement. A lot of our growers have excavators. Theyre roving racks. Theyre putting in entire irrigation. So I think its miniexcavators loader backhoes wheel orders for like I said for feed lots. But also the agrelated businesses some of your crop inputs companies some of your ag processing plants are some of the big buyers of construction equipment. So they have to focus that and some of our key areas. So weve got these synergies of both our people.,TITN,0.7874408960342407,0.5748815386781327,Positive
The Upper Midwest where youve got the ag. Weve got I think some decent talent. If you look at towns like Des Moines Omaha Minneapolis St. Paul and some of it right in our footprint in the south and we could get some of these synergies with our people with our customers and also that agrelated business. So  and at the same time you continue to grow this highermargin product support business. So I say thats our strategy.,TITN,0.9996062517166138,0.9992125029638428,Positive
Right. I mean I appreciate that. Its just that weve been through a couple of cycles here with construction and we are yet to see actual margin momentum out of this business. And were at the beginning of what probably is going to be a pretty good demand up cycle right So just as your  David as youre thinking strategically about this portion of the business do you see this business getting to the point where it can be as profitable or close to as profitable as your ag business or is there something in here that will still hold it back and we should keep our expectations in check,TITN,0.9998091459274292,0.9996182916273424,Positive
No. We definitely have and theres been years where weve got some of our CE stores have actually been some of our top profitable stores as a percentage. So yes I think its definitely if you look historically theres been a lot of wealth created in the construction equipment distribution channel out there some creating multimillionaires. So yes its definitely a very viable segment.,TITN,0.0573593080043792,-0.8852825077071833,Negative
And like I say it is cyclical. There are some difference between the ag. But I think when we get into some of these common markets and stuff I think it works really well for us. So  but I can say what weve done with some of our divestitures were trying to really focus on in these markets and where we think its a good environment to be profitable and its in the right space. And I guess thats why weve made some of these divestitures to get ourselves in a better position.,TITN,0.9999916553497314,0.9999833106895153,Positive
Right. Well final question for me. You spent a good amount of time talking about inventory and talking about tightness in the channel. I guess what Im wondering here is this. If demand is better than what youre anticipating right now in agriculture so better than up 10 to 15 do you think you have the ability to get inventory to satisfy that demand or are things so tight now that you would simply have to sort of say Hey look Im going to take the order but I might not be able to deliver the machine until fiscal 2023. Can you help me understand that dynamic,TITN,0.9997124671936036,0.9994249340444412,Positive
Yes hey Mig. We  as we go throughout the year here that could happen. Theres a lot of growers that presold crop last year and are just going to start recognizing these higher prices as we go throughout the year some of them maybe not until harvest time and so on. But if we got into that opportunity again we do have a pretty good supply of latemodel used.,TITN,0.9966466426849364,0.993293281372357,Positive
Weve got presales that are coming in throughout the year. Weve got some larger customers that we roll with that generate quite a bit of nice latemodel used for us. So that also is another good opportunity for us. The lease returns that I mentioned earlier weve got quite a few of those coming back really nice supply of those.,TITN,0.99992036819458,0.9998407362942314,Positive
The new itself could get tight. So if you got into that situation you could see a bit of a change in mix of revenue for us from  to more used but  and then we do have the opportunity to presell into next year as well which is very common with the lead times that would  and a big uptick like that could end up potentially being captured for us next fiscal year when that equipment would ship in then.,TITN,0.0124239921569824,-0.9751531929690797,Negative
Okay. Just to clarify because I think I heard you answer another question saying that youre kind of expecting to be able to kind of catch up from an equipment availability and supply standpoint somewhere around the fourth quarter. But thats using current assumptions for growth and demand. If things are better than that then thats essentially the thing that kind of starts pushing things into fiscal 2023 right Did I get that right,TITN,0.9968329668045044,0.9936659298336088,Positive
Right.,TITN,0.7990214228630066,0.5980426061407365,Positive
Understood. Okay. Thank you so much.,TITN,0.9876641035079956,0.975328192310448,Positive
Yes. Thanks Mig.,TITN,0.9892561435699464,0.9785122743322103,Positive
Thank you. Our last question today comes from the line of Steve Dyer with CraigHallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.,TITN,0.9884142875671388,0.9768285613230239,Positive
Good morning guys. Its Ryan on for Steve. I want to go at technology a little bit different direction than others have here. But we know theres increasing demand for greater technology in equipment that should boost parts and service accelerate through replacement cycle et cetera for you guys. But what are you seeing as far as consumer desire for greater digitization of the retail and service experience and your guys ability to buy sell service do more online And I guess what are you guys doing from an investment standpoint What are your customers pushing for there,TITN,0.999436378479004,0.9988727562861184,Positive
Yes we continue to see a higher adoption rate of that all the time especially with the younger generation farmers that are starting to come into play. These farms are starting to turnover more and more as we go forward. Weve done a lot with our website working on developing further our customer portal as well as our ecommerce site.,TITN,0.9971168041229248,0.9942336048088103,Positive
So giving our customers the ability to purchase parts online schedule service online we got a number of things built into our new ERP that will go with that when we do the full rollout as well. So were making a lot of investments here on the technology side to continue to get more into better equipped I should say to  for that with our customers.,TITN,0.9996921420097352,0.9993842836524749,Positive
And then on the MA market what are you guys seeing on the ag side domestically here Whats the pipeline look like multiples et cetera And then secondly is there more opportunity to optimize and divest construction stores,TITN,0.872514009475708,0.7450278669761818,Positive
Okay. So first of all on the ag theres been a little bit of a pause on that. I think the basic fundamentals out there. I think were on the front edge of another round of consolidation the aging dealer principals the sophistication of the equipment the capital requirements out there lack of succession alternatives things like that.,TITN,0.9246364831924438,0.8492728765445212,Positive
So with COVID to get this its been difficult to get totally engaged. The travel restrictions people wear masks a little awkward to go in and out of dealerships. And at the same time and most of the dealerships out there receive PPP loans and theyre in the whole forgiveness process right now.,TITN,0.0012714266777038,-0.9974583372225388,Negative
With that said weve got a number of really quality and I can say large acquisition targets that were actually working through to the owners and the principals right now. So Im optimistic about that.,TITN,0.8840097188949585,0.7680192995186446,Positive
And again on Construction again we look at the market we dont really disclose exactly locations. But I guess we want that company to be profitable. And if it means investing in the right markets and investing when a lot of markets arent working we continue to look at that and do what we think is in the best interest for our shareholders on that.,TITN,0.9920101761817932,0.9840203428389684,Positive
But definitely were engaged. Weve got the balance sheet to do some acquisitions out there and were really looking at doing some largerquality acquisitions and were fully engaged with that. And we do think theres going to be a pretty good runway of consolidation and were right in the middle of that and weve got the balance sheet that will support it.,TITN,0.9938708543777466,0.9877417014489778,Positive
Great. Nicely put us guys. Nice results. Ill turn it over.,TITN,0.9933063387870787,0.9866126695946869,Positive
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our questionandanswer session. Ill turn the floor back to Mr. Meyer for any final comments.,TITN,0.7705183029174805,0.5410363322712972,Positive

At this time I will hand you over to Mr. Paulo Kakinoff. Please begin sir.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to GOL Airlines earnings call. I am Paulo Kakinoff Chief Executive Officer and I am joined by Richard Lark our Chief Financial Officer. Today morning we released our fourth quarter figures. Also we made available on GOLs Investor Relations website three videos with the results presentation financial review and preliminary QA. We hope everyone has watched them as we will now only make a few brief considerations and then move to your questions.,GOL,0.9999525547027588,0.9999051093489584,Positive
On January 15 2021 GOL completed its 20th anniversary. During these two decades of continuous innovation the Company has transformed the history of commercial aviation in Brazil and democratized highquality air travel. This journey has made us the leader in Brazilian domestic market for the fifth consecutive year with a market share of 38 a simple human and intelligent airline committed to efficiency.,GOL,0.9408299922943116,0.8816599140524355,Positive
The fourth quarter 2020 reflects MAX return to service and the concentrated growth in the number of passengers transported in the domestic market there in December accounted for 100 of GOLs network operations. In the quarter consolidated gross sales reached approximately R2.5 billion an increase of 44 in relation to third quarter 2020. The Companys daily sales in fourth quarter exceeded R27 million. With additional flights during the month of December passenger revenue increased 96 over the third quarter 2020.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In the 12 months net revenue reached R6.4 billion a reduction of 54 compared to 2019. In 2020 GOL was the only Brazilian company to be included in a select list of 13 global airlines that received the Stage 1 certification of the IATA Environmental Assessment IEnvA which is validation that that the Company has developed a consistent environmental policy and is fulfilling its responsibilities. GOL has been recently recognized by the MSCI in its ESG Rating Scorecard as one of the most sustainable and carbon efficient airlines in the world reaching carbon emission rates up to 20 below its industry peers.,GOL,0.959320306777954,0.9186405650619058,Positive
With that Im going to hand you over to Richard who is going to take us through some additional highlights.,GOL,0.8295276165008545,0.6590550297826705,Positive
Thanks Kaki. During 2020 GOLs management fully honored its commitments to the global capital markets including the amortization of its 2022 Senior Notes US78 million in the first quarter of 2020 and its Term Loan B its main shortterm debt in the amount of US300 million in the third quarter of 2020.,GOL,0.9677407741546632,0.9354815098533096,Positive
Even during this very challenging year we kept our liability management discipline. We have addressed all the relevant financial obligations provided for in our cash flow. We ended 2020 by significantly reducing our shortterm debt balance and strengthened our solid partnerships with the main providers of working capital.,GOL,0.969939351081848,0.9398786663285887,Positive
In December 2020 the Company also obtained an important validation of the capital markets through the issuance of Senior Secured Notes due 2026 in the amount of US200 million with a coupon of 8 per year. We have no significant capital markets maturities until 2024. This is a reflection of GOLs commitment to strengthening its balance sheet over the past five years.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
During the quarter the Company achieved cash flow generation of R3 million per day and the liquidity position of R2.6 billion through its effective management of working capital with matching of inflows and outflows which has been the key driver to maintaining liquidity. The cost per available seat kilometer CASK was R0.2644 a nominal increase of 25 compared to the same period last year but a 4 decrease when excluding the exchange rate variation during the same period. In the quarter the costs strictly related to operated flights adjusted CASK corresponded to R0.2006. This represents a 4.9 nominal decline and a 27.4 decline when excluding the exchange rate variation compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and demonstrates the Companys continued focus on readjusting its unit cost structure to an even more efficient baseline when compared to prepandemic levels.,GOL,0.7637326717376709,0.5274650618225705,Positive
GOL has converted the main fixed payroll and leasing costs into variable costs. In addition the return to service of MAX aircraft will enhance efficiency with a reduction of about 15 in fuel consumption more flexibility to operate on both short and longhaul routes and an increase in autonomy compared to the 737 NG family and 16 lower carbon emissions.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The following metrics demonstrate efficient capacity and pricing management with the Companys permanent focus on sustaining revenue levels even with the reduction in the volume of corporate passengers. One an average yield per passenger of R0.2755 a reduction of 17 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to the reconfiguration of the Companys network concentrating and distributing operations in its hubs and consequently increasing stage length.,GOL,0.2398755848407745,-0.5202497364579062,Negative
Two average load factor of 81.1 which was a reduction of 0.4 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 due to prudent supply management adding capacity based on demand indicators with the help of our advanced data analytics tools and ontime departures of 92.5 which was an increase of 6.3 percentage points according to Infraero and data provided by the main airports.,GOL,0.9739395976066588,0.9478791641468787,Positive
Adjusted EBIT was R347 million corresponding to a margin of 18 which demonstrates the reestablishment of the operating margins necessary to support growth in operations and our continuous search for balancing supply and demand and yields that allow sustainability. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and in 2020 reached 39 a growth of 7.2 percentage points yearoveryear. GOL ended December with a total fleet of 127 B737s and 93 aircraft operating in its network which was an increase of 22 aircraft compared to the end of September 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020 despite the challenging operating environment daily flights doubled to approximately 400 when compared to the third quarter of 2020 to serve 177 markets representing 54 of the daily flights performed in the fourth quarter of 2019.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Now I would like to return to Kakinoff.,GOL,0.1575431525707245,-0.6849146991459722,Negative
Thanks Rich. After months of continuous recovery we are seeing a contraction in travel demand due to rising number of COVID19 cases in Brazil combined with extended international travel restrictions the beginning of low season and customers waiting to get vaccinated. In relation to January the Company recorded a 28 reduction in the level of sales during February. Now in March the Company is implementing an even greater reduction and operate approximately 250 flights per day placing its operations at approximately 40 of March 2020.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We believe that the current market conditions while difficult are temporary and that demand will continue to recover as the vaccine rollout progresses in Brazil. GOL is prepared to react quickly in adapting its air network with the flexibility to face fluctuations in demand in the coming months. GOL will continue to be recognized for having the most adaptable and flexible business model prioritizing the safety of customers and employees with the best team and the lowest cost in Brazilian aviation.,GOL,0.0092048048973083,-0.9815915713260004,Negative

QuestionandAnswer Session,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. The floor is now opened for questions. Operator Instructions And our first question will come from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.,GOL,0.9991973638534546,0.9983947267500917,Positive
Hi thanks. Good morning guys. I guess good afternoon for you. A couple of questions here a few questions. Lots of cost savings initiatives last year that obviously are helping from a working capital perspective. And Im just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on what the relief drivers were that came into play in the fourth quarter and how theyre going to continue to come into play in 2021 And it seems like the cash outcome in the quarter is different than what were seeing in the income statement. And so Im just thinking that there is these initiatives are coming in nicely. Im just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on those,GOL,1.0,1.0,Positive
Yes sure Dan. A couple of things. Obviously one is the pure cost component the other is the working capital component. As you know we are managing the Company through the pandemic with kind of simultaneous focus on unit costs and working capital the financial equilibrium. So Ill kind of answer it in that respect.,GOL,0.9385932087898254,0.8771863443770076,Positive
One we had about R150 million in the fourth quarter we had about  some of this was work we have done in the Q3 that went into the Q4 but about  just one second Dan I got to fix the phone here. Hold on a sec. Sorry. Four general categories. One was renegotiation of operating liabilities.,GOL,0.0334177315235137,-0.9331656892095146,Negative
Second was leasing. Third was payroll. And fourth was related to working capital thats across the board that would come on the working capital equation. And one of the components also in the fourth quarter related to how we are managing  matching the operations inflows and outflows. Those are kind of the  meaning matching our capacity to the actual demand that were identifying in our operations. So those are kind of the general categories that produce that positive operating cash that you see with the fourth quarter.,GOL,0.9998779296875,0.9997558592294808,Positive
Now I think its a little bit more important to maybe link your question into the  to the Q1. The same categories exists for us and the same levels in terms of size would be there. But then in the Q1 on a relative basis in those categories that I described to you around R150 million of sources on working capital come out of renegotiation of operating liabilities. A similar amount on the leasing side of the equation from Q4 to Q1 which is keeping those same levels that for us was a source of around R150 million of savings if you will. From a cash flow perspective obviously some of that impacts costs.,GOL,0.937015175819397,0.8740302765549877,Positive
On the payroll which is the third category I mentioned about R50 million or so which comes from keeping the same level that we had at the Q4 based on our negotiations with the labor force. And then on the working capital financing side of the equation a little over R800 million in terms of what we roll from maturities in the Q1 into the future quarters.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And probably I just want to answer that way is that this is like an ongoing management that weve been doing in this pandemic which is working to match the cash outflows with the cash inflows. And a big source of it is on the working capital side of the equation in these categories operating liabilities leasing payroll and then working capital that  which has allowed us to maintain the levels of liquidity and cash burn that we are seeing.,GOL,0.1955113112926483,-0.6089783364405253,Negative
On the cost side specifically were reporting good numbers excluding the grounded portion of our operating assets so that you can see what the unit cost would be without the inefficiencies of the aircraft on the ground due to the pandemic and weve kind of provided that information in there. But I think I preferred to answer to the question that way in terms of the focus on unit costs. But the sources if you will of the savings the cash flow savings or cost savings if you want to define it that way are those categories. Hope thats helpful.,GOL,0.1252678632736206,-0.749465316215346,Negative
Yes no thats great. I appreciate it. Just maybe a couple more questions here. One with respect to the corporate reorganization of Smiles I wonder if you can just elaborate a little bit on the steps from here and whether GOL could start a competing loyalty program from the scratch I think American did that once its spun off Sabre. Are there other steps you could take to shift economics just given the current crisis,GOL,0.9723886251449584,0.9447772173745734,Positive
And then Ill just throw out a second question here and this might actually be for Eduardo. Im just wondering about the demographics of those people that are traveling and how that demand demographic has evolved Any perspective on that would be great. And just I guess bigger picture. Weve got a new health minister in Brazil. And whether there is the political appetite there to take the steps needed to really curb the pandemic so the economy can open back up more fully,GOL,0.9952739477157592,0.9905478897976217,Positive
Eduardo Jos Bernardes Neto,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning. Im sorry sir. Please go ahead. Go on.,GOL,0.8799830675125122,0.7599659919536066,Positive
No I just saying a lot there but whatever you can share would be great. Thanks.,GOL,0.9971256256103516,0.9942512477941798,Positive
Eduardo Jos Bernardes Neto,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. Sure sure. So McKenzie good morning. Actually let me try to answer each one of the questions in same sequences. So firstly regarding the Smiles and corporate reorganization I hope you understand that we wouldnt like to raise any kind of speculations before the next shareholder meeting which is scheduled to happen on March 24 next week. And then we have 30 days  with Smiles holders we have 30 days to decide which option they will choose closing then further its going to take a further 30 days after that. So at the moment we are not willing to further speculate on any other alternative but having the shareholders deciding on the current proposals. And then depending on the final results then we could discuss other possible actions.,GOL,0.0590731799602508,-0.8818547617523443,Negative
So the second is  did I answer to your question,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I appreciate it. Thanks. Yes.,GOL,0.9991745948791504,0.9983491887743405,Positive
Eduardo Jos Bernardes Neto,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. So the second is related to demographic. Let me tell you specifically in  on two different dimensions. Firstly is geographic. Geographically there are three important aspects that should be highlighted. The mix of demand by part of the region of the travel hasnt changed much during the pandemic. The Southeast region remains as they start of about 50 of all passengers marginally oscillating in the last quarters. The participation of passengers restart again travel at the North region has grown over the quarters.,GOL,0.0789812803268432,-0.8420385372868404,Negative
So looking into the twoyear series the demand originating from the South region has decreased since its participation in the overall demand. Because  this is mainly because the South region has a larger portion of business travelers than on the other ones. And this is specifically the segment most affected by the crisis. The destination mix substantially changed in the last year. The Northeast region which has a huge leisure potential grew as a destination and thats possibly a new trend which is going to stay going to remain even after the COVID. It would be of saying that the Brazilians are finally discovering more the country side and our natural attractive leisure destinations and that might create a new source of traffic specifically having the Brazilians travelling more broadly within the country.,GOL,0.8884166479110718,0.776833162804343,Positive
And finally the corporate markets the shuttle markets mainly the loss of faith in the demand composition. The same happened to South and the Southeast markets which are now and before for being more corporate markets. So thats an overview we didnt change that much during the pandemic. I believe that were going to have more leisure travelers to the Northeast region when the pandemic spills over as a new  or not new but more sustainable and substantial market and the corporate travel will recover or will resume only after we will have this pandemic over.,GOL,0.1641993224620819,-0.6716023514284798,Negative
We believe  we strongly believe that there are two milestones ahead of us with regards to the pandemic development. Firstly is to achieve the population above 65 years being confidently vaccinated. And its reasonable to expect that this effect will happen by the end of the second quarter considering the current vaccination schedule which has been official shared with the public by the Brazilian health minister. That would drop significantly the number of cases and deaths. And thats also could immolate the same pattern that we experienced for the quarter last year when the average  the daily average of casualties dropped around 60 from its peak. And this is what we do expect to achieve when the population above 60 years 65 years would be immunized. That would represent drop from the current 2000 something casualties per day to something around 1000 or even below.,GOL,0.9999393224716188,0.9998786448709043,Positive
Those are all overseen numbers and thats the right word to that  to casualties would be overseen. But considering what we have learned in the first phase of this pandemic theyre using negative correlation between the number of that that cases and the air travel demand. So I believe that by the end of the second quarter we would see more consistent demand recovery that we are seeing at the moment.,GOL,0.9356738924980164,0.8713477083132912,Positive
And the second milestone would be around the 60plus of the population would be immunized that would bring the combination of the socalled herd immunization with the most explosive part of the population being protected and that could drive this to the end of the pandemic. Not the end of the disease  I mean the COVID19 which will stay for years likely like any other virals but the pandemic has a good chance to be over in Brazil by the end of the third quarter. We are all engaged and involved in such kind of construction.,GOL,0.9349796772003174,0.8699592768903237,Positive
And the third question you raised was related to  please remind me Im sorry. The health minister the new health minister.,GOL,0.0403650999069213,-0.9192709441607859,Negative
Yes.,GOL,0.7864110469818115,0.5728218393455979,Positive
Eduardo Jose Bernardes Neto,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
That  we do expect that considering the circumstances and the urgency for new measures that we are going to have a new set of actions being taken to be more effective in combating the COVID development at the moment. I dont believe in a serious disruption in comparison to what we have done so far politically speaking.,GOL,0.9754427671432496,0.9508855050119789,Positive
But I think that the need  the level of  sorry the level of the urgency has made the a lot around the last weeks and personally I do expect that were going to have some good news ahead of us likely such as pulling ahead some of the vaccines already scheduled to be delivered by the beginning of the fourth quarter and having more efficient public campaigns incentivizing people to follow the protocols and this kind of stuff. Okay,GOL,0.9808188676834106,0.9616377125011162,Positive

Thank you.,GOL,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thanks Dan.,GOL,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
The next question will come from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi yes. Hey Rich Kaki good afternoon. I want to  Rich I just want to go back on the liability management. In the investor update you provide sort of a guide there where the liquidity is going from R2.6 billion to R1.9 billion. We know that the cash burn is R3 million a day so call that R100 million. In the release you do go on to say several important initiatives are relevant to ensure that the Company maintains its liquidity at the end of Q1.,GOL,0.9953540563583374,0.9907081071782751,Positive
And with Dan you did mention it looked like the four different buckets and its like  I think it was R150 million R150 million another R50 million and then I think you are going to push off R800 million maybe on the working cap side. Im not sure if I heard those numbers right. Which then it doesnt totally add. And Im just curious if you also have just regular debt coming due number one sort of part one. Part two is are you also anticipating an additional transaction to get you to that R1.9 billion Does something else have to happen in addition to the four pillars that you identified Thanks.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Sure. Thanks for the question. Thats and  Ill just kind of maybe add in there and get a free ride on. We get some questions from the call a platform the Internet. Sometimes when I give a little bit longer answer its only because I got a question from the screen thats right in front of me now and I try to answer the question of that person together. And so I think complement that we had a question it says it seems that the debt maturing this year including leases exceeds the Companys cash balance. Are you planning to refinance that,GOL,0.9958099126815796,0.991619820368183,Positive
So obviously we dont pay lease  we dont pay operating expenses from cash balance. We dont pay leases from cash balance. We pay leases from operations. Maybe that wasnt exactly your question but this is how it works. Were a flow company right. Airline is a flow company inflows outflows. And then capital structure it has everything we have in terms of capital structure at GOL is to support the longterm assets. We have no significant capital structure maturities until 2024.,GOL,0.9419368505477904,0.8838736318788716,Positive
So just kind of put that on the side for the folks that are looking at the balance sheet and looking at the IFRS 16 the timing of leases I mean those are all operating leases at our Company. And  yes and that bucket specifically we have been managing our relationships and contracts with the leasing company keeping them at a minimum level that matches as much as possible with operations.,GOL,0.8766120672225952,0.7532239873552247,Positive
As you know when we get our negotiations in the second and third quarter of last year weve got a big portion of those into  we transfer the portion of fixed costs into variable costs which also include a portion of those aircraft in powerbythehour contracts with a low portion of fixed cost and then variable cost.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And so that component is dealt with. But its important to remember that that portion in other words all of the aircraft leasing is treated as on balance sheet debt and then a portion of that is the shortterm component. Im just going to put the capital markets debts on the side. We have no significant maturities until 2024. We are staying current on interest. In terms of the lease debt were able to match that with the level of operating inflows lets put that on the side also which get to the heart of your question.,GOL,0.7830147743225098,0.5660292899783195,Positive
Now the way our Company has worked our airline weve  since the beginning of this pandemic avoided schizophrenic capital raising and done our best to preserve our noncash current assets which are things that you see on the balance sheet like restricted cash deposits kind of those things on the upper lefthand side of the balance sheet. It also includes our hedging activities legal deposits. And so we continue to manage the Company in that way releasing restricted cash and deposits when we need to now within the  and those will finance a part of the overall need number one.,GOL,0.9506148099899292,0.9012295611080892,Positive
Okay.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And secondly is what we do in terms of receivables receivables management factoring things like that those balances have come down. But you do see in those numbers there receivables balance and we factor sales have ramped down significantly in the shortterm put a lot of pressure on that. And then finally is other  all of those are really on the upper lefthand side of the balance sheet.,GOL,0.9791438579559326,0.9582876910493916,Positive
Now then we have sources of new funds that come on the upper righthand side of the balance sheet outside of what we already have. And yes we have been able to at this Company  at our Company we never lost credit from our commercial banking relationships and weve been able to when needed have shortterm credit coming in there when we have a deficit from a working capital perspective.,GOL,0.9379936456680298,0.8759872174186811,Positive
And so if you look at this Q1 and this scenario is going to extend into the Q2 weve been able to finance this operating deficit with freeing up of noncash current asset. And then we also are able to  where that is not sufficient in terms of a timing perspective meaning that we can unlock our restricted cash unlock our noncash current asset it takes a little bit longer weve been able to finance that gap with shortterm credit facilities. And thats  and youll continue to see that going forward. The liquidity that youre seeing now and that were reporting last time you saw that here in the recent cycle was August. And when we get down to that level of R1.9 billion R1.8 billion thats really kind of like the absolute minimum for us.,GOL,0.082750380039215,-0.8345003333689771,Negative
Yes.,GOL,0.7864110469818115,0.5728218393455979,Positive
And weve been in fact caught I would say we did a good job all the way up until around January 15 of being one step ahead of the game on the pandemic in terms of data analytics and seeing where the demand was.,GOL,0.9412441253662108,0.8824881806899192,Positive
And then I think we like many other countries around the world airline markets at least in terms of what we see around South America Latin America it was a surprise in the last 15 days of January the demand collapse because of this wave of COVID. We immediately at the end of January used our primary tool which was capacity because all those deposits are selling capacity demand. And so we did that work at the end of January. Obviously there was a phase in February. But pretty much by the end of February we have done what we need to do on capacity.,GOL,0.9988855123519896,0.9977710233754056,Positive
And youve now been seeing publicly and I know you look at the capacity systems religiously every day. Youve seen the ramp down in capacity. But that work was done last 15 days of January and first 15 days of February. And then what you saw competitively you saw the other companies with a  I dont know a four to sixweek lag pretty much follow suit on that and pretty much everybody has kind of fallen into the same category. I think weve had an advantage of having advanced data analytics investment done years ago where we see it immediately. And so for us it was  December was the home to hurricane and we have to deal with another three or four months of specifically the second leg of the hurricanes.,GOL,0.9782123565673828,0.9564246871618551,Positive
Now overall we will be operating at this level of liquidity in the short term. Theres a little bit of season  normal seasonality in there that you would have. But its hard to kind of extrapolate that out. And clearly you see kind of March April be the worst month  portion of our capacity would ramp down anyway. But its hard to extrapolate the effects right now because of everything thats mixed in here. But  and as we said like the key chuck thats missing it has been missing was the large corporate piece. But what happened in the Q1 about midJanuary is we lost something that we had was a significant portion of the high value VFR traffic.,GOL,6.216764450073242e-05,-0.999876856730495,Negative
And that  and so a little bit of what Kaki was mentioning its a combination of  we had restrictions come back in and a little bit  vaccine is around the corner so people are sort of waiting. But we  in the 12 months of this pandemic this is the most restricted we have been here. And also speaking from the perspective of the city of Sao Paulo which is about 15 17 of Brazilian GDP and the state of Sao Paulo which is about a third of Brazilian GDP the economic engine of Brazil this is the most restricted weve been in terms of movement and activity lets say mobility wise. Having said that the economic activity is much higher than it was when we first had these restrictions.,GOL,0.9944310188293456,0.9888620310199443,Positive
And so theres a little bit of that theres a little bit delay in momentum is happening here just the restrictions are different. I mean we have curfew now from 800 PM till 500 PM. And so at 730 everybody runs home. But they are already set up to do work. But that significantly impacted this kind of high end VFR component because beaches and hotels are effectively closed.,GOL,0.0235954225063323,-0.9528103189529892,Negative
And so that client base that we had we had to deal with it during the Q1. It eroded a bit of our liquidity probably versus what we had planned coming into the year probably to the tune of something along the order of say R300 million or so maybe a little bit more versus where we expected. And so were a little bit lower at amount right now. But we had  a lot of these deals that we had kind of locked in we have loosened them up a little bit in December and January and we just kind to clamped down on them again back to where we had already sort of negotiated and set it. That Im saying on the fixed costs with aircraft with labor.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then on the  going back to the question that related to the  when you looked at debt maturities. Like I said we dont have any capital maturities. We dont have any  what we have is really more commercial finance maturities. And those  were constantly matching those with expectations on future cash flow as well as we can  well continue to roll those over even though from an accounting perspective you report those based on  usually report those based on what you have specifically on a contract. So for example in that maturity stack that you see for Q1 there is about R300 million on the  on a local debenture we have with two banks and that gets rolled out into the future for the commercial finance things.,GOL,0.8914365768432617,0.7828730242687609,Positive
All those commercial finance things I think weve been explaining this at a indiscernible during this pandemic how the commercial finance works at our Company and we continue to do that. Those arent  we are not the corporate trustee or WTC trustee or a bond trustee. We dont have any of those kind of structural impediments to do that. But at the end of the day its about how effective we continue to be managing working capital. We do not have visibility on  we did not have visibility and continue not have visibility on when the large corporates are coming back.,GOL,0.0884415805339813,-0.8231179255950007,Negative
And now we lost a portion of the shortterm booking curve which is this  that we kind of think it was around 15 to 20 of our VFR traffic which was doing these traveling based on the mobility and the lack of restrictions. This was across the region. I mean we saw with many of our counterparts at least in South America and I think even Mexico this kind of 15 back step affected everybody on a relative basis. But if you look at Brazil right now and you compare it to all the major domestic airline markets around the world its the worst right now in terms of this back step.,GOL,0.0607997477054595,-0.8784016242036966,Negative
In fact were like almost 100 negatively correlated with like whats going on in the U.S. in terms of the ramp up in domestic traffic. Our experience tells us that were probably about 60 to 90 days behind what youre seeing happening in the U.S. I can say March where you are its going to be May where we are because May where you are might end up going back right. And so this biological phenomenon thats happening at the end of the day very few authorities seem to have a  the real grip on structure.,GOL,0.0205508172512054,-0.9588995330926974,Negative
But the only point  the final point I would mention and this is a key point because everything I was talking up to now allows me to answer a lot of questions on the working capital side. In terms of major sources of new funds like I said we did not do  we did not burn up all of our  we have not got any external funding from the government here like the U.S. quotes a number something like 40 billion has been pumped into the airlines. I dont know what the final number is there but its mindboggling for us here. We have not gotten that. And so we have to be very careful about preserving our tools to access responsible capital.,GOL,9.042024612426758e-05,-0.9998203514935681,Negative
You saw in December we created this secured financing structure. We deposited about 900 million of collateral in there and  which gives us up to 500 million 600 million of financing capacity with a 5.5year deal 8 coupon we did 200 million. And so weve got capacity in there of at least 300 million. And one of the things thats been important to us through this pandemic which all of our partners appreciate is weve been current on interest in all of our  Id say our Capital Markets Day. And so we did out  and those capital markets deals generally are semiannual interest payments.,GOL,0.9959924221038818,0.9919848394303556,Positive
We paid around R300 million of interest in January. Were so 100 in compliance with the best  what I consider the best ESG metric you can have is if you are not in default or in the Chapter 11 even though thats deep on ESG are looking at more of things like carbon emissions. But weve kept in compliance with capital markets and thats allowed us to keep our capital market access. Obviously with us we dont have the luxury of permanent capital market access and so we have to have windows which are a combination of when the market is favorable the global market is favorable and those windows of having our quarterly results disclosed.,GOL,0.9996700286865234,0.9993400569796902,Positive
And so thats kind of a little bit longer of saying is that weve got at least 300 million of financing capacity in the new secured mechanism that we have created. Thats probably our go to mechanism. In the short term if we need to put some additional cash on the balance sheet and as you know Mike the two rules of capital markets activity when youre seeing from an airline is always remember that an airline always needs more cash and to go to the market when the market wants you to go to market. And those are the rules of the indiscernible it.,GOL,0.9999032616615297,0.9998065232077382,Positive
It wasnt you that told me the other guys retired. And hed always call me up and he is like how come youre not raising more capital now and you always think its going to get better to raise capital. But were more mature in that respect. We have those tools available. And thats without mentioning the other tools we have. We have mature unsecured securities to trade and have continued to trade decently in the market. We get a lot of reverse inquiries on  if we want to do caps on our unsecured bonds and unsecured convert. And our answer to that is well right now we have an even better vehicle which is the secured vehicle with interest and collateral part.,GOL,0.9993793964385986,0.9987587921373797,Positive
So if we need to we can go to that. But of course we have to be careful and pick our moments because we will have incidents like if we run out of those things we cant call up our friends in Washington D.C. and ask us  ask them going to send us 15 billion thats not going to happen. So weve got to survive. But I think its also meant that we have in an indirect way weve created a lot of value here with our existing stakeholders across the capital structure both bondholders and we preserved our latent credit quality.,GOL,0.9695332050323486,0.9390663737454259,Positive
We havent blown up the right side of our balance sheet. For example if you compare our end of year 2020 balance sheet with our end of year 2019 balance sheet you actually see a slight reduction in current liabilities you see a slight reduction in air traffic liability and you see a lengthening of our longterm debt. In other words if you just look at the right side of the balance sheet and forget about the left side the right side of our balance sheet is better than it was at prepandemic. But of course what has happened is we lost about half of our current assets that were distorted by the pandemic.,GOL,0.0007244944572448,-0.9985522023154513,Negative
I say current assets I mean the effects of cost of revenues and receivables but  and so weve been trying to preserve the right side so where then the left side of the balance sheet fills up again. And we think thats going to be at some point in the second half of this year youre going to see a company that looks a lot like it looked like in the second half of 2019. And then also on a unit cost basis that I was saying in the previous question that the other kind of guiding record that we had here is to do everything we can to preserve our unit cost advantage so that when we come back on the other side of this we look a lot like we looked at the end of 2019.,GOL,0.1127451062202453,-0.7745108452503953,Negative
But also we have a couple of very tough months to get through here. Were not  were trained airline operators were not trained scientists in the field of epidemiology or how this is going to be managed. So were using the same information you guys have in terms of managing and reacting to this pandemic and the virus.,GOL,0.0007728040218353,-0.9984555831286808,Negative
As Kaki mentioned we are now  were probably like two months behind where you guys are in terms of the vaccine roll out but were starting to get momentum now. I mean this momentum. If you walk around the street around here and youve got what you call it makeshift  temporary or makeshift vaccination centers set up on the street and so that infrastructure is starting. But thats against what has happened here over the last month or so where hospitals have gone to full capacity utilization. If that was not the case weve probably would have not had the restrictions coming back in.,GOL,0.1259780526161193,-0.7480449366837364,Negative
But because the hospital infrastructure is not sufficient to support whats happening now with the second wave the governments came in and put in these restrictions to try to help slow down that curve. Without saying if you remember back when these things started its 15 days to flatten the curve right since we are already a leader with the highest curve weve had. So thats how I would answer that. And if you have some other questions on just shoot us an email we can go into the details on that. I just like to maybe move to the next question. We have another,GOL,0.9283431768417358,0.856686268261831,Positive
Yes which I would just  yes. I would just add just putting words to numbers it seems and to Kakis point about we get to September in Brazil and things are on the up and up. The R1.9 billion in the March quarter of liquidity thats your low point right because you get to June 30 and you should be selling July August September and people should actually feel better because the numbers are better. And I think thats the point is that the R1.9 billion is the low point just based on everything you and Kaki have said. Again thats a reasonable conclusion there but like you said anything can happen. So thats kind of how I am coming out on it based on what youre  youve been able to give and how youve been able to manage. But you can,GOL,0.9999858736991882,0.9999717473815366,Positive
Just to emphasize a little further what we have above said. We could consider the high likelihood that July would be much stronger than we are foreseeing right now assuming as I said before that the population above 60 years will be already immunized. And the fourth quarter milestone I have mentioned would be the kind of trigger to resume faster the business drivers. So we are sticking to this plan.,GOL,0.9991722106933594,0.9983444203999163,Positive
Very good. Thanks Kaki. Thanks Rich.,GOL,0.999962568283081,0.99992513652154,Positive
Thank you.,GOL,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
The next question will come from the Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey thanks. I wanted to ask you just a couple of questions on network development. And understand this is a bit of a weird time right now. I mean the good news bad news is youre very experienced with cycles. This is not your first rodeo in Brazil. You figured out how to find relative competitive strengths in the past. But I just wanted to ask as you look at the competitive landscape holistically what are you seeing is it logical is it rational And maybe in that answer could you comment on slot waivers are they still in effect etc.,GOL,0.9981058835983276,0.9962117649386912,Positive
Hi Duane. At the moment I believe that we might be facing a kind of a phenomenon that happened exactly by the beginning of the pandemic in Brazil. So some of the players reacting faster or  either reacting faster or see in the radar whats really going on a little bit earlier than the others. Definitely there is at the moment a reduction in demand caused by the increase in the COVID case  in the number of the COVID cases in Brazil and thats affecting the forecast quite significantly. And thats why we have been so Id say rational about the nearterm capacity being deployed. And I can tell you that this is exactly the same behavior noticed among the competition.,GOL,0.9993844628334044,0.9987689249330309,Positive
So I believe that there is a series I could say so a lack of rationality in the market at the moment. But I believe its going to be fixed in one or two weeks considering the current demand weakness. Anyhow we are not depending on it and we took our measures in order to  as we already  to manage our own performance quite independently of what is being decided by our competitors but I couldnt tell you that at the moment 100 of the market is rational because it is not. It is what we have seen so far.,GOL,0.976466953754425,0.9529338794552562,Positive
And we havent  we didnt go the route of having debt financing like some of those guys. All the other guys have their own debt financing so weve managing it differently. Generally we  for five years now weve been the leader at least Brazil domestically on setting the tone literally since May of 2016 thats when the things looked over GOLs been the leader and everyone else has been a follower. That has generally been the case and it varies across the board in terms of the lead lag.,GOL,0.9890660643577576,0.9781321156812404,Positive
I mean part of what was Kaki was saying is that we recognized really quickly in January that what was happening and at the end of January we started the process of ramping down our capacity. And I think other folks took somewhere between one and two months to come up with that. And I think thats  part of it is our  and its how we manage the business on a daytoday basis part of it is investment that we made in data analytics which allows us to have maybe a bit  a little bit better handle on that component there.,GOL,0.980859875679016,0.9617197285412122,Positive
Does that answer your question Duane,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yeah. Thats helpful. And then just a few comments its something we should know but what is the status on slot waivers How long before those need to be kind of extended,GOL,0.993529975414276,0.987059943115677,Positive
Eduardo Jos Bernardes Neto,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So Duane we have mentioned it before its Eduardo Jos. Actually we are under a formal waiver until the end of September. So I mean the IATA summer season is  even at this and we have already engaged in new conversations with the Brazilian authorities because considering the pandemic outrun it might be that we all will need a further seasonal waiver to be applied. So this is our expectation which is going to be the waiver is starting  Im sorry the season is starting next October. I mean the IATA winter season. So we are now addressing this discussion toward the Brazilian civil airline authority and I hope that were going to have something related to that.,GOL,0.9651880860328674,0.9303761305666749,Positive
Okay. Lets just  were going to  just so we kind of get through all of the questions in fairness to everyone. And were going to move to next question. But just before that Im going to slip in a question that we got from one of our big investors that asks your release said that you were able to get a good portion of leases and power by the hour agreements. Do you feel that you continue to have these favorable agreements as travel recovery in developed markets potentially outpaces recovery in Brazil especially with rising cases and a slower vaccine rollout,GOL,0.9539005756378174,0.9078010963208056,Positive
So the short answer is yes. I was responding a little bit on the micro question but maybe drill down a little bit. I mean we can keep our minimum payment which can be up to about 70 reduction and continue to extend that if we have a slow recovery. Also given potential new taxation on leases GOL can get some grace in March and April to preserve payments. Power by the hour is on about half of our contracts the other half for deferral related in that situation deferrals would be expanded. And our lessors are supportive and understand the situation we continue to work on that with them.,GOL,0.9998846054077148,0.9997692106778686,Positive
That ends up working out to be that we would in that worser scenario we end up paying now more than about 50 of our lease payments according to our agreements. And also it goes into one of the previous questions as well when folks look at the onbalance sheet accounting of the shortterm lease payments versus what would actually happen when you look at that number. If we need it to the number could be half of what that shortterm liability is on the balance sheet which is if I remember correctly. But thats not how we manage the business in terms of looking at the onbalance sheet next 12 months lease payable. But the difference there would be about R1 billion of cash savings during fiscal 2021.,GOL,0.0154384672641754,-0.9691242391611571,Negative
So now we can go to the next question. We have another three question the people in the queue here. Well try to get through them to the top of the hour where we need to switch to our Portuguese call as everybody knows we do these things in both English and Portuguese. So please next question.,GOL,0.9692164063453674,0.9384327759938096,Positive
The next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi good afternoon everyone. I will probably ask two couple of quick questions. First Kaki to your  in your response to Dan you talked about kind of the phases of recovery. Im just kind of wondering what your corporate clients are telling you in terms of what they need to see to get comfortable returning to kind of business travel,GOL,0.9994003176689148,0.9988006346229521,Positive
Yes. Savi thats including three different groups. I mean 20  sorry onethird of the business travelers never stopped flying in  even during the pandemic so those are the essential workers that helps sustain this kind of business attention forever. And this is I would say the base levels which never change. The second group another onethird is made of large corporates that those are under human resources policies that are blocking down of flying. So I believe this is the group that we referred sort of resume when the pandemic will be either under control or probably over.,GOL,0.061003029346466,-0.8779950606793528,Negative
And then you have another portion maybe onethird which I believe twothirds of this onethird possibly will take much longer are or maybe even not come back. Those are the travelers that we will replace with the business travel by one of the new technology such as video conference and these kind of stuff. I believe that when I say that we will have from the third quarter on more business. So thats resuming their old habits I believe that we will have on top of the current onethird whos still traveling we would be another third maybe 40 percentage points on top of the 30 is still flying.,GOL,0.7962335348129272,0.5924668267171542,Positive
Did I answer to the question,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
That was perfect. Thats very clear. Thanks Kaki. And then Richard real quickly just on the fuel hedging front whats in place for 2021 and are you doing anything more than Im guessing not but just curious in a quick update on the hedging,GOL,0.9999977350234984,0.9999954700442968,Positive
Sure. We continue to do a pretty good job of dealing with that. Its been less important. Our normal objectives are related to margin management and basically permitting enough time to adjust yields to pass on cost increases thats been pretty much irrelevant during this pandemic. We came into the first quarter with about a 50 hedge ratio for 2021 and 20 hedge ratio for 2022 in the low50s if you will. And what we did during Q1 is we  when we hit our view triggers in the low60s on oil thats been what I was saying I think it was in the first question that those gains if you will are  if you will a noncash current asset. And so I think during this pandemic if you go from the beginning of the pandemic until now we probably had  probably close to somewhere between R400 million R500 million of cash inflows because of gains on our fuel hedge position. Its not really much to hedge against given the demand dynamic here and the inability to do yield management period. But once yield management comes back on you will expect to see it. But its a little bit lower than those hedge ratio I mentioned. Its not relevant for us right now. Its how were managing the business. And we  actually our view is things have overshot a little bit now. So were not going to be putting on any new hedges at this level right now in terms of our fundamental view on that.,GOL,0.0034696161746978,-0.9930619556081032,Negative
And so Im going to now move to  before we move to next question Im going to fit in one more of the questions were getting from the  on the platform here just to kind of be efficient with the time. And the question was basically to what do you attribute the drop in your total liquidity from the end of Q4 to the end of  what youre expecting from end of Q1 in your perspectives,GOL,0.0589365661144256,-0.8821279896068512,Negative
Answer to that would be our accounts receivable dropped about R200 million over the course of the first quarter here 2021. We finished  December we finished with around R700 million in accounts receivable and now we have about R500 million thats related to the drop in the forward booking curve. And this is a temporary effect. We had around R1 billion a month on average throughout the year of accounts receivables prepandemic that balance right now is about R500 million. As I said in Q4 that was around R700 million. Now if we had the same level of receivables with the forward booking today we would have liquidity of about R2.2 billion to R2.3 billion. So I hope I answer that.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So now lets go  we can squeeze in one more question here. And it looks like Im not going to be able to get the last question Matt but you can  we can set up a call later. We can move to the last question here operator.,GOL,0.9990963339805604,0.9981926668838663,Positive
The next question will come from Rogrio Arajo of UBS. Please go ahead.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Rogrio Arajo,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks very much. Hey Richard. So thanks for the opportunity. I have a couple here. One is on the debt amortization that is expected for the 1Q 2021 its about R900 million. So my question is is the R3 million per day cash burn expected for the 1Q Does it include this R900 million debt amortization and also how does the company tended to finance debt amortization Thats the first one. Thank you.,GOL,0.9999373555183412,0.9998747109620043,Positive
Rogrio did you just start  have youve been on for the whole call or did you just join now,GOL,0.7507266998291016,0.5014531025010958,Positive
Rogrio Arajo,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Im here for the whole call.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Okay. So weve already answered this question. I mean,GOL,0.7287225127220154,0.45744470205587273,Positive
Rogrio Arajo,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Can you be more specific please Richard can you be more specific how were going to find that I heard you saying a bunch of options you had but can you be more specific then please,GOL,0.9747136831283568,0.949427336113057,Positive
Yes again  okay. Yes because we got we have to respect everybodys time here and we can also go into the math with you offline but basically  contractually we have those maturities but the majority of those are commercial finance which are with a specific counterparties and we basically rolled those over. And so we dont have majority of those maturities. We dont have as cash outflows from an amortization perspective but we have as interest expense maintenance. So thats basically it.,GOL,0.992729663848877,0.9854593190308327,Positive
I can go into the details with you offline so we can get to that. But theres  as I mentioned its R300 million of the cashes in there and then theres about another R400 million or so of commercial finance that its  as I mentioned during this pandemic every single quarter and every single quarter we get the same question. Were constantly working to match those cash outflows with cash inflows and staying current on interest to preserve our credit access. So thats about R700 million of those numbers you mentioned are in that category. And then the rest the GAAP there is just how we manage working capital. But if you need more than that we can talk offline. You said you had another question.,GOL,0.9950827360153198,0.9901654661688006,Positive
Rogrio Arajo,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes thank you Richard. And next question is regarding yields. So with the current effect depreciation and the oil price expansion what kind of yields does the company need to be profitable in terms like can you say the amount of expansion in yields necessary versus 2019 levels or something like that for the company to be as profitable as before also considering all the efficiencies that you have implemented in during this crisis,GOL,0.988811731338501,0.9776234493395384,Positive
Yes. When you saw in the Q4 those levels because remember I was mentioned before weve had two main ways of measuring the company during this pandemic. One is on the unit cost side and second is on the equilibrium side. That if you look at the adjusted profitability in the Q4 EBITDA margin EBIT margin those are the levels that we had prepandemic in terms of profitability. Excluding the aircraft on the ground which is that piece of assets that were keeping so that we have the  as opposed to returning those assets which we could if we wanted to returning those and then contracting those back we dont think its necessary. So those aircraft that we have today on the ground are going to be necessary on the other side of this pandemic which we believe is going to be in the second half of this year.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And so the Q4 numbers that you saw on an adjusted basis excluding the ground enforcement of the fleet is thats the level of profitability that we need. And thats the level of profitability that we have we have prepandemic. So thats latent in our structure right now. There is a little bit of inefficiency there in terms of aircraft utilization. Were not near we want to be on that but I think thats the best indicator of how weve been managing our company. Another way of saying it for you if based on the current economic right now with the current level of operating costs cash which is being affected by the pandemic  comparing lets say fourth quarter  on the fourth quarter 2020 we had that EBIT the yield would be R0.28. And so use that however you want to use it because I know you do a lot of work on the yield side of the equation and youre looking at things like that.,GOL,0.9435688257217408,0.8871375841722395,Positive
And so on a recurring basis that R0.28 yield compared to a R0.21 cash it gives us that very nice positive EBIT but youd take a total basis which includes all the aircraft on the ground inefficiency thats breakeven R0.28 minus R0.28 is zero. And so thats kind of how we manage the business to the Q4. And so on a fully loaded basis we had that breakeven in the Q4 but on a recurring basis which weve been trying to give you guys this data in the release its a lot of work for us to kind of give you that actively so that you can use that because itd be very difficult for you to come up with that on your own positive. I think that positive EBITDA of about R0.07 for ASK.,GOL,0.9535090327262878,0.9070180100309908,Positive
And if you look at our competitors theyre not even close to matching between yields and unit cost. And thats how weve been managing our company. Im not saying that the other guys are theyre managing it for whatever other objectives weve had but weve got two primary directives during this pandemic. One is to make sure that we keep our unit cost advantage and that we come out of this. We have a unit cost that is equal to or lower than where we came in and then a proper matching of assets liabilities during the pandemic. The yield component and this is important right I mean today the yield is pretty much given to us. The demand is given to us. We dont have  the normal tool of yield management in the traditional sense really doesnt exist today. We dont have the ability to either stimulate or repress demand today just because of where demand is and the capacity. And in fact I think I saw your report and you were highlighting the overcapacity. I mean if you look at it on a fully loaded basis yes with the grounded aircraft versus the current demand thats  at demands that we have today obviously theres overcapacity its going to depend on how people manage those aircraft on the ground.,GOL,9.748339653015135e-05,-0.9998062251843364,Negative
Youve seen what weve been doing. I mean last year we returned 13 aircraft and received three aircrafts. As were transforming to MAX were the only company that youve covered that returned aircraft last year. And we have the ability to do that and we have the continued ability to do that. And weve given you some insights on what were thinking about for this year as well were going to  were planning on returning another nine aircrafts and then that hopefully will be replaced by MAXs is coming in as we get back on our fleet transformation. And thats the key to the unit costs. Because again its like for us we start with the unit cost the yield generally were trying to optimize it given the demand that were given. And normally in a normal environment we have a pretty good ability to do yield management with our large corporate and managing it through the acute seasonality that we have here in Brazil.,GOL,0.9958088397979736,0.9916176745996921,Positive
But right now anyone that tells you at least in our market here that theyre doing yield management either doesnt know what theyre talking about or theyre selling your bill of goods because we do not have the ability to stimulate demand with fares. And also the demand that thats there today is not necessarily being suppressed if we increase fair. So keep that in mind that probably continues for at least a couple of months until we get back on track here with normal yield management.,GOL,0.8807613253593445,0.7615225085750272,Positive
And so with that were going to have to move to the closing remarks operator. We had one or two more people in the queue but we know you guys and so please shoot us an email or well follow up back with you later today to see if we can help you with any additional questions.,GOL,0.9932245016098022,0.9864489951425761,Positive
So with that we go to closing remarks. Operator please.,GOL,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
This concludes todays questionandanswer session. I would like to invite management to proceed with closing remarks. Please go ahead.,GOL,0.1220356225967407,-0.7559298014222393,Negative
Thank you all very much for your questions. I hope this session was helpful to you all and please do not hesitate to getting contact with us in case you need any further clarification. Thank you very much.,GOL,0.9647434949874878,0.9294869479459213,Positive

Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to Salarius Pharmaceuticals Q4 and YearEnd 2020 Financial Results Call. At this time all participants are in a listenonly mode. After the speaker presentation there will be a questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions. Please be advised that todays conference may be recorded. Operator Instructions,SLRX,0.9704580307006836,0.9409160261845744,Positive
I would now like to hand the conference over to your host Jason Rando with Tiberend Strategic Advisors. Sir please go ahead.,SLRX,0.9983830451965332,0.996766088465505,Positive
Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining Salarius Pharmaceuticals 2020 fourth quarter and fullyear financial and corporate results call. Earlier this afternoon Salarius Pharmaceuticals issued a press release detailing its financial results for the 3 months and the fullyear ended December 31 2020 which we encourage listeners to read.,SLRX,0.9887666702270508,0.977533327062921,Positive
The press release can be found in the News section of Solaris arma.com. Salarius also filed a 10K this afternoon which is available on Salariuspharma.com and sec.gov. Before beginning todays call I would like to make the following statement. Today well be making certain forwardlooking statements about future expectations plans events and circumstances including statements about our strategy future operations and the development of our lead investigational drug candidate seclidemstat and our expectations regarding our capital allocation and cash resources. These statements are based on our current expectations and you should not place undue reliance on these statements. Actual results may differ materially due to our risks and uncertainties and including those detailed in the Risk Factors section of Salarius Pharmaceuticals 10K filed with the SEC and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time.,SLRX,0.9999170899391174,0.9998341797793984,Positive
Salarius Pharmaceuticals disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise.,SLRX,0.9666510224342346,0.9333020051133663,Positive
With us on todays call is David Arthur Director and CEO of Salarius Pharmaceuticals who will provide an update on spares corporate and clinical achievements during the fourth quarter and its vision for the future and Mark Rosenblum CFO who will review Salarius fourth quarter and fullyear 2020 financial results.,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
David please go ahead.,SLRX,0.7448590993881226,0.48971789462440896,Positive
Thank you Jason and thank you to everyone joining our conference call today including all of you who are joining for the first time. Todays call highlights an exciting time in the growth of Salarius. In just the past few weeks we have achieved important clinical milestones in the development of our lead drug candidate seclidemstat and we have achieved significant milestones in financing Salarius.,SLRX,0.9997974634170532,0.9995949265926638,Positive
We have completed the dose escalation portion of the ewing sarcoma clinical trial and seclidemstat is now being investigated at the recommended Phase II dose in three distinct patient populations made up of viewing sarcoma and Ewingrelated sarcomas which in the case of viewingrelated sarcomas include two patient populations made up of myxoid liposarcoma and other FETtranslocated sarcomas. Each of these three patient groups Ewing sarcoma myxoid liposarcoma and FETtranslocated sarcomas potentially represents a separate regulatory path to approval and the related commercial opportunity.,SLRX,0.9938071966171264,0.9876143858518514,Positive
These recent clinical milestones and the expansion of the viewing clinical trial to include Ewings related sarcomas further underpins and supports the first prong of our development strategy speed to market. Salarius is now investigating three patient populations each of which is supported by future clinical results we believe has the potential for accelerated regulatory approval and supports our strategy of speed to market.,SLRX,0.9999472498893738,0.9998944997158645,Positive
In parallel Im very pleased to report that as a result of a series of financial transactions Salarius now has the capital resources of approximately 37 million in available cash to fund our current clinical trials while providing the ability to develop seclidemstat in larger market indications including solid tumors and hematologic cancers. These larger market indications represent the second prong of our development strategy expand the market.,SLRX,0.9932366609573364,0.9864733138521395,Positive
In addition to these clinical and financial achievements we have also amended the Ewing clinical trial to expand the addressable Ewing sarcoma patient population and improve patient access to seclidemstat earlier in the patients treatment paradigm.,SLRX,0.917393684387207,0.8347872702999535,Positive
By combining seclidemstat with the common second or thirdline chemotherapy treatment topotecan and cyclophosphamide we hope to open the door to seclidemstats potential use much earlier in a Ewing patients treatment continuum as a second or thirdline therapy while improving their patient outcomes.,SLRX,0.9523454308509828,0.9046908048932585,Positive
Let me make sure I clearly communicated the importance of these developments. We believe we have integrated seclidemstat into the Ewing sarcoma standard of care and seclidemstat can now be easily administered as a second or thirdline therapy in our ongoing clinical trial.,SLRX,0.9859632253646852,0.971926433996221,Positive
In addition to increasing the number of patients who can receive seclidemstat treatment we believe that this also makes it easier for physicians to utilize seclidemstat early in the Ewing sarcoma continuum of care while potentially improving patient outcomes.,SLRX,0.966364860534668,0.9327296809731012,Positive
Finally in a small subset of Ewingrelated sarcoma patients with relapsed or refractory disease that enrolled in the advanced solid tumor trial all patients in the subset showed indications of seclidemstat drug activity as evidenced by a medium time to progression that was greater or longer than a benchmark commonly used for singleagent activity in this advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting. It is important to note that these indications of drug activity occurred at doses below the recommended Phase II dose that we are currently using in our ongoing Ewing and Ewingrelated sarcoma trials.,SLRX,0.9957865476608276,0.9915730902988258,Positive
Again to be clear in a small subset of patients with relapsed or refractory Ewingrelated sarcoma we observed a median increase in the patients time to progression when compared to a benchmark commonly used for singleagent activity in the advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting.,SLRX,0.97036874294281,0.9407374505623878,Positive
We believe this is exciting preliminary data of seclidemstat activity in Ewingrelated sarcomas. I cannot understate our view regarding the importance of these developments to the ongoing growth of seclidemstat and Salarius nor can I understate how well we believe this positions Salarius for the future. Mark and I look forward to speaking in detail about each of these accomplishments later in the call.,SLRX,0.9956958293914796,0.9913916536519849,Positive
However before that I would like to take a moment and provide my thoughts on the past 12 months. If you had asked me a year ago if Salarius would be in the position of strength that we are now in I would have responded with a resounding absolutely. Why would I have said that Because we had a welldefined strategy and we executed on a plan that I fully expected will yield positive results.,SLRX,0.9919157028198242,0.9838313960024094,Positive
Of course this plan did not factor in the COVID19 pandemic. In just a matter of days last March the world was impacted by a onceinageneration situation. Salarius was not immune. But in spite of the many uncertainties we were able to quickly make adjustments that enabled us to persevere in certain ways become stronger as a company.,SLRX,0.9734458923339844,0.9468917530129868,Positive
This type of fortitude was especially evident in those who led and participated in our clinical trials including our clinical development team the investigators and staff at our cancer centers that are implementing our clinical trials and most importantly the trial participants and their families who selflessly volunteered their time and energy despite these many challenges.,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the patients with advanced cancers participating in our clinical trials everyday activity suddenly became an even greater ordeal. Yet these patients were willing to participate in our trials so that we could continue developing seclidemstat to all the past and current participants in our trial we thank you.,SLRX,0.9999743700027466,0.9999487399749398,Positive
Later in todays discussion Ill talk more about the positive impact of our recent clinical and financial milestone achievements and our plans to continuing developing seclidemstat for larger market indications including solid tumors and hematological cancers.,SLRX,0.901347041130066,0.8026939646565705,Positive
But now I would like to hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer Mark Rosenblum who will speak to our fourth quarter and fullyear 2020 financial results. Mark please go ahead.,SLRX,0.9540430903434752,0.9080861259020123,Positive
Thank you David. For the threemonth period ended December 31 2020 Salarius reported a net loss of 1.8 million or 0.10 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of 1.9 million and 0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009.,SLRX,0.2353703379631042,-0.5292602355839227,Negative
For the fullyear Salarius reported a net loss of 7.4 million and 0.50 per basic and diluted share versus a loss of 6.9 million or 2.12 per basic and diluted share for the prior year. The loss from operations before other income for the three months ended December 31 2020 decreased by 0.3 million compared to the loss from operations of overall 2.1 million for the same time spend last year which was primarily due to an increase of 0.4 million in grant revenue and lower general and administrative costs more than offsetting higher research and development expenditures.,SLRX,0.0004580616950988,-0.999085068157356,Negative
Increased research and development costs resulted from increased drug manufacturing costs. The decrease in general and administrative costs resulted from the absence of expenses related to Salarius onetime transformation into a public company during 2019 which did not reoccur in the current period. This offsets higher personnel costs in the current period. Our December 31 balance sheet states the company had 11.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The balance sheet was strengthened in early 2021 as the company raised over 30 million from both the sale of our common stock and underwritten public offering and warrants exercises.,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We also received 0.9 million in nondilutive secret financing during Q1 2021. Salarius has an additional 4.8 million under the secret Grant and we expect to receive a portion of that amount in 2021. The results of these funding activities is that Salarius has currently available cash of approximately 37 million our strongest financial position to date.,SLRX,0.1778677105903625,-0.6442655588779205,Negative
We believe Salarius has the financial resources available to advance our ongoing clinical trials through completion and beyond.,SLRX,0.7925458550453186,0.5850914627858774,Positive
With that Id like to return the call to David.,SLRX,0.7681946754455566,0.536389074557468,Positive
Thank you Mark. As we have discussed our goal as a company is to maximize the potential of seclidemstat and by doing so bring hope to patients and their families facing limited treatment options while creating and building shareholder value. To that end I would like to state that by midyear 2021 this year we hope to have active clinical trials across 5 separate patient populations evaluating seclidemstat as singleagent therapy and in up to 3 different combination therapies.,SLRX,0.9993292689323424,0.9986585370651107,Positive
As discussed earlier completing the dose escalation stage of our Ewing sarcoma clinical trial is a major achievement. The primary purpose of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of seclidemstat with secondary endpoints to assess the maximum tolerated dose determine the recommended Phase II dose and measure antitumor activity pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. I am pleased to report that the dose escalation stage succeeded. Data demonstrated that seclidemstat has a manageable safety profile. The recommended Phase II dose for the expansion stage has been established.,SLRX,0.999996542930603,0.9999930858570849,Positive
And importantly pharmacokinetic data indicated that treatment at the recommended Phase II dose achieved human plasma concentrations above levels where seclidemstat demonstrated activity in preclinical or animal studies. We believe the data from this dose escalation trial is compelling. And for this reason Salarius has submitted the full findings including details on safety dosing and initial efficacy signals for presentation at an upcoming oncology conference.,SLRX,0.8210887908935547,0.6421773685082008,Positive
Once the conference embargo lifts we will be able to provide more detailed information. Again please allow me to reiterate because it is important to state clearly. The dose escalation stage of the trial achieved all key endpoints. It demonstrated seclidemstat safety profile established a recommended Phase II dose and we believe it provided early evidence of drug activity.,SLRX,0.9604284167289734,0.9208567862849153,Positive
Although our dose escalation trial is primarily focused on establishing seclidemstats safety we believe as weve stated we observed preliminary evidence supporting seclidemstats potential to treat advancedstage cancer patients. Notably these observations occurred in patients primarily treated at doses below the recommended Phase II dose in patients that were heavily pretreated with multiple prior treatment failures and in patients who had relapsed or refractory disease upon enrollment.,SLRX,0.9941368699073792,0.9882737328253584,Positive
This preliminary evidence of drug activity was observed in a refractory Ewing sarcoma patient who is treated with singleagent seclidemstat for 6 28day cycles and demonstrated more than a 75 tumor reduction in prospectively defined some of target lesions. However despite this significant tumor reduction a new nontarget lesion appeared at the end of cycle 2 resulting in a classification of progressive disease as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 or RECIST 1.1.,SLRX,0.8582355976104736,0.7164710262245095,Positive
Having said that Salarius believes this data demonstrates preliminary single agent drug activity in a patient with refractory Ewing sarcoma meaning disease which had failed prior medical treatments responded to seclidemstat as singleagent therapy. This is especially encouraging given the challenge in treating refractory disease and the fact that the patient received no other cancer treatment while taking seclude stat. Given the preliminary evidence of drug activity observed Salarius believes there is a meaningful opportunity to introduce seclidemstat earlier in the Ewing sarcoma continuum of care which we believe will benefit patients and increase the addressable Ewing sarcoma patient population.,SLRX,0.0280794203281402,-0.9438423179640282,Negative
Internal preclinical research suggests that Ewing sarcoma cell lines seclidemstat has an additive effect an additive effect when combined with the chemotherapy agents topotecan and cyclophosphamide. This suggests the seclidemstat can be added to topotecan and cyclophosphamide and potentially improve upon current patient outcomes.,SLRX,0.9997812509536744,0.9995625016465794,Positive
Additionally because topotecan and cyclophosphamide de are commonly used as second or thirdline treatment. Salarius can potentially increase the addressable patient population for seclidemstat by supporting doctors and patients use of seclidemstat earlier in the treatment paradigm.,SLRX,0.1752970516681671,-0.6494068797867774,Negative
Based on these conditions Salarius considerations Salarius amended the dose expansion trial protocol so that Ewing sarcoma patients who have failed 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy may be treated with seclidemstat in combination with topotecan and cyclophosphamide as second or thirdline therapy. This is an exciting development and one that aligns perfectly with our goal to increase our use of seclidemstat by exploring its potential as a treatment for a broader patient population.,SLRX,0.9952084422111512,0.9904168787103171,Positive
In addition to the Ewing sarcoma news we believe we have seen encouraging clinical data from a small subset of viewing related sarcoma patients enrolled in the Salarius advanced solid tumor trial.,SLRX,0.8795645236968994,0.7591289038234377,Positive
All patients in this subgroup had relapsed or refractory disease when enrolled in the trial and all patients in this subset demonstrated signs of drug activity despite being treated with seclidemstat at doses below the recommended Phase II dose. Patients in this subgroup exhibited a median time to progression longer than a commonlyused benchmark for assessing singleagent activity in this advanced relapsed soft tissue sarcoma setting. This is exactly  and I want to repeat this is exactly the type of data we were hoping to see to support seclidemstats potential to treat these difficult viewing Ewingrelated sarcomas and move forward with our strategy to expand in new patient populations establish new potential paths to regulatory approval and pursue the related commercial opportunities.,SLRX,0.9992600679397584,0.9985201349974486,Positive
Salarius has now initiated the dose expansion stage of the Ewing and Ewingrelated sarcoma trial which was expanded to include up to 30 patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma as well as up to 30 patients with sarcomas that share a similar biology to Ewing sarcoma. Ive referred to these as Ewingrelated sarcomas or FET translocated sarcomas. These Ewingrelated sarcoma patients or patients with myxoid liposarcoma and other FET translocated sarcomas will continue to be treated with singleagent seclidemstaat and represent completely new addressable patient populations each with the potential path regulatory approval and a potential commercial opportunity.,SLRX,0.9984023571014404,0.996804712298341,Positive
The dose expansion portion of the Ewing and Ewingrelated trial will continue to evaluate safety and antitumor activity in all participants with preliminary data readouts expected towards the end of 2021 and 2022.,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Salarius has also submitted findings from the advanced solid tumor trial including details on safety dosing and initial safety signals for presentation at an upcoming medical conference. Once the conference embargo lifts we will be able to provide even more information.,SLRX,0.7542134523391724,0.5084266116777727,Positive
In summary we believe the clinical data collected thus far from the Ewing sarcoma trial and the ongoing advanced solid tumor trial has demonstrated that seclidemstat has a manageable safety profile can be administered at doses that are clinically relevant and we believe has provided evidence of drug activity in patient populations with advanced disease.,SLRX,0.1552320122718811,-0.6895369824987545,Negative
We believe that the clinical progress discussed today paints a promising picture of seclidemstats potential as both a single agent and combination therapy for patients with hardtotreat cancers in need of better treatment options.,SLRX,0.0742125809192657,-0.8515759417867315,Negative
Salarius and our clinical investigators are excited about the potential of seclidemstat to treat Ewing sarcoma patients earlier and the potential to treat these additional Ewing sarcoma patient  Ewingrelated sarcoma patients.,SLRX,0.995353937149048,0.9907078687595541,Positive
In addition  and additionally we believe there is a substantial unexplored potential ahead for seclidemstat and we anticipate even more opportunities in 2021 to justify the use of seclidemstat in other underserved cancers. In that regard Salarius has completed much of the necessary work to begin clinical trials in other cancer indications that align with seclidemstats mechanism of action and we look forward to announcing these trials in the near future.,SLRX,0.1694692969322204,-0.6610623962058999,Negative
Areas of interest we have previously discussed include hematologic cancers and the use of seclidemstat in combination with immunooncology therapies specifically checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors are a class of immunotherapy treatment designed to unleash a human immune system attack on cancer cells. However these drugs do not work in all cancer patients or in all cancer types.,SLRX,0.135428786277771,-0.7291434580942739,Negative
In addition patients do not show an initial  in addition patients that do show an initial response can become resistant to the checkpoint inhibitor treatment and experience a return of the disease commonly known as disease relapse. Interestingly data from preclinical studies conducted by the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix Arizona and published in the peer review journal plus 1 last year demonstrated the potential of using seclidemstat in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to overcome cancers ability to hide from the immune system and thereby unleash the immune system to attack the cancer.,SLRX,0.0020500719547271,-0.9959010457402742,Negative
In simple terms seclidemstat may turn tumors concealed from a patients immune system called cold tumors into hot tumors our tumors the immune system is able to identify and infiltrate.,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
These now hot tumors could then respond to treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. This provides a significant opportunity for seclidemstat because it could be used to treat patients with a wide variety of cancers that are currently unresponsive to checkpoint inhibitors. As I said earlier considering the data we have generated to date and the potential for additional data generation in ongoing clinical programs and soon to be announced additional clinical programs these are exciting times for Salarius.,SLRX,0.9735870957374572,0.9471741599882599,Positive
Again by midyear 2021 this year we hope to have active clinical trials across 5 patient populations evaluating seclidemstat as single agent therapy and evaluating seclidemstat in up to 3 different combination therapies.,SLRX,0.9524518847465516,0.9049037128112991,Positive
I would now like to take questions. Joining me for the QA portion of this call is Mark Rosenblum Chief Financial Officer Dr. Nadeem Mirza Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Dr. Daniela Santiesteban Director of Corporate Development.,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Operator Instructions. Our first question comes from the line of Wangzhi Li of Ladenburg. Your line is open.,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the comprehensive update and summary in creations on all the progress. My first question is read into the expansion cohort the Ewingrelated sarcoma. You mentioned the two different patient population myxoid liposarcoma and other sarcoma. Just want to clarify is there a number of patient allocation for these different type of sarcoma or just a mix,SLRX,0.9999385476112366,0.9998770951492162,Positive
Thank you for the question. Dr. Mirza would you like to take that,SLRX,0.9746804237365724,0.9493608172898398,Positive
Yes. Hi David thanks. So yes we have allocated around 10 to 15 for myxoid liposarcoma and around 10 to 15 in other FETtranslocated sarcoma patients. And the reason being so that we could  we are able to see a clear signal of activity.,SLRX,0.994152307510376,0.9883046080497551,Positive
Got it. And the reason you think about is myxoid liposarcoma is it based on the myxoid liposarcoma you saw from the dose escalation portion,SLRX,0.9234169125556946,0.8468337338171803,Positive
Thats correct. In our advanced solid tumor that is still undergoing dose escalation. We have observed  we have seen  we have observed a good signal and for reasons of confidentiality and the fact that we have submitted this to an upcoming oncology conference.,SLRX,0.999197483062744,0.9983949651688127,Positive
I cant go into details but we have seen a strong signal in patients. And based on that these additional 10 to 15 patients will supplement that signal. And so we should be able to get a very strong signal for further development or in fact potential discussion with health authorities on the next steps.,SLRX,0.008705049753189,-0.9825910822099939,Negative
Got it. Its helpful. I know youre under embargo for the conference presentation but any color on what should we expect in terms of number of patients or what kind of data and timing is at the conference later this year Any further color you can share,SLRX,0.9997572302818298,0.9995144602742554,Positive
Yes. Unfortunately the embargo is quite broad. We cant discuss or disclose anything that was submitted in the abstract. And I apologize I wont be able to tell you the details...,SLRX,0.0016365945339202,-0.9967280010747918,Negative
Got it. No problem. Yes yes I understand. I mean then maybe shift gear to  you are going to have multiple trials ongoing later this year. And just  and of course you now have a strong balance sheet. Just any color on what time  for what kind of stage the current cash can fund all these trials through with completion of this trials or mid of those trials And I understand there are two trials that will be investigated sponsor so maybe customized. Any color on the cash runway into the year relating to the completion or progress of other trials,SLRX,0.9991061687469482,0.9982123364283659,Positive
David would you like to take that,SLRX,0.8415375351905823,0.6830748814790735,Positive
Actually Wangzhi thanks for the question. Im going to toss that one to Mark because he is the master of our recent financial transactions and is managing our 37 million in available cash. Mark,SLRX,0.9946016073226928,0.9892032082099962,Positive
Thanks Wangzhi. We get the tag team because Im sitting right next to David. So really the way we look at it Wangzhi is were going to have some readouts probably at the end of Q4 certainly in Q1 2022. And at that time we will have substantial cash available to  first of all well have substantial cash available to complete all the clinical trials that were currently conducting.,SLRX,0.9998873472213744,0.9997746943084562,Positive
And then when that information takes us to a place that says we are  we have several different trials on the Board so we wont discuss what they are. But when we make the decision to pivot to a particular trial well have sufficient cash to make great headway into whatever trial we select to use.,SLRX,0.9763613939285278,0.9527227596776244,Positive
And that  so were in very good shape right through the end of 2021 really well past 2022 as well. This recent cash raise really set us in a different position.,SLRX,0.7882747650146484,0.5765492776329979,Positive
A frequently asked question is do you guys have sufficient capital to complete the trials that youre currently conducting,SLRX,0.7691701650619507,0.538340054953131,Positive
When we have nondeal road shows when we have investor roadshows thats a very common question. You guys have sufficient cash to complete the plan youre currently on. And now we can say emphatically yes we do. So I hope that helps you.,SLRX,0.9955446720123292,0.9910893387134905,Positive
Okay. Thats great. Thanks for taking my question.,SLRX,0.9985655546188354,0.9971311075276776,Positive

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aydin Huseynov of Benchmark Company. Your line is open.,SLRX,0.9992566108703612,0.9985132208545331,Positive
Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations with the strong quarter and actually the strong year. So I just wanted to go back to Ewing sarcoma and Ewingrelated sarcoma trial. So you have a combo with chemotherapy in second and thirdline and then you have a single agent for Ewingrelated sarcomas in the thirdline. So why did you decide not to combine Ewingrelated sarcomas with chemo just like you did with Ewing sarcoma itself,SLRX,0.998786687850952,0.9975733742555224,Positive
Nadeem would you like to take that one,SLRX,0.9631656408309937,0.9263312377519832,Positive
Yes sure. Its a very valid question. So for the myxoid liposarcoma there is  there are two drugs that are currently approved. What we have observed in these patients as a single agent that those patients have failed those standard treatment and still had significant clinical activity.,SLRX,0.9393879175186156,0.8787757627819552,Positive
So we want to further establish singleagent activity for the myxoid liposarcoma. And if we are able to show what we observed in the preliminary I think it will be a relatively a good path to regulatory approval as a single agent. We do have some internal discussions have been going on. So we are looking at further combinations as well but were not ready to disclose them at this time.,SLRX,0.123127669095993,-0.753745707121913,Negative
Regarding the FET translocation to sarcoma there is no standard treatment for those patients. So  and these patients are treated with different chemotherapies and a different regimen. So it will be difficult to select a single or a couple of chemotherapy regimens that one would want to combine with.,SLRX,0.969440221786499,0.9388804071428818,Positive
And among those patients in the FET translocated patients who had failed multiple lines of prior treatments chemotherapies and other agents we have observed a significant clinical activity as a single agent and following the same logical path of thinking if we can show similar activity in additional patients that would be regulatory  potential regulatory path for approval for a single agent.,SLRX,0.163813978433609,-0.6723730399447918,Negative
Right. Appreciate that. And  yes you did. I just wanted to followup on that. So what do you see there as a success. Where does  can you remind us what the standard of care stands for those 2 kind of groups of patients Second thirdline in sarcoma and kind of thirdline plus Ewingrelated sarcoma. Is there kind of ORR specific number Or is there overall survival number that youre targeting,SLRX,0.9997085332870485,0.9994170662266413,Positive
Yes. So I cannot disclose what we are aiming for what we observe but I can tell you what the benchmarks are for Ewing sarcoma. The benchmark is around 5 to 6 months median PFS. For myxoid liposarcoma in earlier lines of patients now I remember we have patients that have failed with standard treatment but in myxoid liposarcoma the range of median PFS is around 3.5 to 4 months. Thats the median PFS.,SLRX,0.142930120229721,-0.7141407812480816,Negative
For FET translocated sarcoma as I mentioned theres no clear good benchmark but what we have observed when we looked at the literature it averages around median of 2 to 3 months. And in our study we have seen much much significant prolongation of these progressionfree survival time point.,SLRX,0.1766904890537262,-0.6466200033545514,Negative
Apologies again Im going to probably go a little bit different that but do you envision able to pathway as a singlearm study in any of those Ewingrelated sarcoma cohorts of trials,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Well yes that will be a discussion with the health authorities. Based on those patients have exhausted all treatment options if these patients represents a highly unmet need and I think that regulators would take a view of that and when you present them with the data showing that these patients have failed either standard treatments available or de facto standards that people use currently.,SLRX,0.0691309571266174,-0.8617391954297993,Negative
And once they have failed those treatments and yet single agent seclidemstat provides additional benefit in terms of prolonging their time to tumor progression I would certainly hope that the regulators would take that into account for potential approval.,SLRX,0.7859529256820679,0.571905596199987,Positive
Okay. All right. And for advanced solid tumors are there indications that you see as the most promising in your opinion for seclidemstat And are you planning to apply biomarkerbased kind of selection work forward in the Phase II,SLRX,0.9984763264656068,0.9969526511148521,Positive
Daniela would you like to comment on biomarkers and what were currently reviewing,SLRX,0.7550554275512695,0.5101105631056804,Positive
Yes. Happy to. So in our advanced solid tumor trial we did enroll as you know these Ewingrelated sarcoma patients. And based off the signal mentioned by David and Nadeem is why were now expanding the Ewing sarcoma trial to include these additional patients. So already the FET solid tumor trial has given us an indication of patients that may respond better to seclidemstat.,SLRX,0.9998842477798462,0.999768495421705,Positive
In addition were conducting preclinical work to identify if there are sensitizing mutations to seclidemstat. That work is ongoing and we hope to report results in the next few months.,SLRX,0.0621273815631866,-0.8757463549055785,Negative
All right. I appreciate that. And another question I have  sorry this is the last one. About the  you mentioned the additive effect of chemotherapy and are you planning to share that data Are you planning to publish that data And if there is additional  there is additive effect to chemotherapy why wouldnt you try all the trials with chemotherapy instead of trying  as a single agent,SLRX,0.9065658450126648,0.8131315786430708,Positive
So Daniela why dont you start with the internal additive data and our plans to offer that and additional work and then Ill address the second part of the question.,SLRX,0.0892964601516723,-0.8214081653405223,Negative
Yes happy to. So we have done in vitro experiments combining the chemo regimen topotecan and cyclophosphamide with seclidemstat and seen additivity. The mechanism there is topotecan and cyclophosphamide or DNA damage agents and LSD1 has been implicated as well in the DNA damage response. And it may also expose more DNA through its chromatin reconfiguration to the effects of DNA damage and agents. So we feel quite strongly about combining with topotecan and cyclophosphamide from a mechanistic point of view.,SLRX,0.9341230988502502,0.8682461191690678,Positive
But then also importantly our safety profile does not have significant overlapping toxicity concerns with the chemo regimen which means that moving forward in clinic thats a good strategy as you dont have those overlapping talks concerns.,SLRX,0.1727021336555481,-0.6545967189054005,Negative
And Ill let David mention why were taking the strategy of continuing to pursue single agent and some of the other Ewingrelated sarcomas before combining with chemo,SLRX,0.8716999292373657,0.7433997055290373,Positive
So Aydin thanks for the question. The short answer is we have not taken anything off the table. Were going to follow the science and always try and do whats in the best interest of achieving the most positive in outcomes. So where we are now with the myxoid Ewingrelated sarcomas is were following the results that we observed in the subset of patients. And were fortifying those results with greater patient numbers. And by continuing in single agent therapy as Nadeem mentioned earlier if we see results that were hoping to see we could have potentially both a single agent and a combination therapy approach to treating those types of Ewingrelated sarcomas.,SLRX,0.9999449253082277,0.9998898505508012,Positive
While this is going on our  were working here in our lab internally to identify what chemotherapy agents might be the best combination choices should we decide and head that direction. So looking back to my how I started the answer to the question were keeping all options on the table. But right now we like the fact that were pursuing single agent therapy and see where that takes us which sets up the option of having in a number of directions in the near future.,SLRX,0.9999718070030212,0.9999436139724338,Positive
Our next question comes from Hunter Diamond of Diamond Equity Research.,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Firstly great presentation. I think one of the best ones Ive heard from you David and the management team and a lot of positive developments. My question relates to what do you view as the potential of seclidemstat in hematological malignancies And what that is sort of driving that,SLRX,0.9415910243988036,0.8831819791686408,Positive
Hunter thanks for the question. Daniela would you like to take that,SLRX,0.992656707763672,0.9853134067734524,Positive
Yes happy to. Thanks for the question Hunter. So LSD1 as a target has been wellvalidated for hem malignancies due to LSD1s role in blocking differentiation and then driving malignant cell growth. And weve seen other companies with LSD1 inhibitors showing clinical proofofconcept in hem indications specifically in AML.,SLRX,0.986435055732727,0.9728700952947709,Positive
At Salarius what weve done is we studied seclidemstat in a variety of heme malignancies AML myelodysplastic syndrome. And weve seen that seclidemstat has an antiproliferative effect and also that it shows synergistic effects when combined with a commonly used agent in the space azacitidine. And then as we mentioned before one of the benefits of seclidemstat is that we have a manageable safety profile and we have not seen significant heme talks that some of these other LSD1 inhibitors will often face in clinics.,SLRX,0.999007761478424,0.9980155217740068,Positive
So we think the combination of our activity in the preclinical model coupled with our advantage in terms of more manageable heme safety profile will give us an advantage in pursuing seclidemstat within the hematological malignancy indication.

Great. Thank you very much Daniela for the update. So my next question is maybe more high level. Obviously the company is in the best financial position since weve covered the company and in its history and it has as you stated money for existing trials. I guess Im just trying to understand  and I dont know how much you can comment on this.,SLRX,0.9364709854125975,0.8729418950926631,Positive
Obviously youre very positive as stated on the prospects of each subpopulation populations. How do you view the company as sort of  are you looking at  and I know I may have asked this before but are you looking at sort of other assets to acquire at this point Is it more of stuff would come inbound,SLRX,0.9478099346160888,0.8956198070167343,Positive
Or do you think theres just so many sort of prospects for a smaller public company at this point that youre just trying to advance sort of these new indications that you already have this quarter,SLRX,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So Hunter thanks for the question. The answer is Im constantly looking at all areas that will first support the development of seclidemstat and ensure that we are maximizing its potential for patients and ultimately shareholders. Were  we want to do is best for patients and create value for shareholders. Now having said that were approached constantly by other organizations that have seen our ability to develop assets and advance them. And they want to talk to us about potentially assisting with their assets and moving them forward. So we take a lot of calls we take a lot of meetings and I cant comment or commit one way or another of what might happen in the future.,SLRX,0.9999436736106871,0.999887347154228,Positive

Absolutely. Yes. No Im just thinking very high level because as you know theres only sort of a few companies where you play in epigenetics right I mean you can almost count them on a hands public companies that have access to funding. So I would think  I guess what Im hearing is generally youre feeling that there are a lot of opportunities if and when if something arises It seems like its a great time to be in the epigenetics market as a whole.,SLRX,0.9242318868637084,0.8484636834047337,Positive
I think its an outstanding time. Its even better than great. Its an outstanding time. We have a genetic deal. Theres  there are a lot of companies that are developing other epigenetic drugs going after other targets. I think in the LSD1 space or the LSD1 inhibitor space were really well positioned. There are other companies that have recently announced preclinical programs in the LSD1 space.,SLRX,0.9996787309646606,0.9993574615463385,Positive
Many of them are pursuing reversibility in their LSD1 inhibitor. So everything were seeing at a high level indicates that were heading in the right direction and we just want to head down that path as quickly as we can.,SLRX,0.978464126586914,0.9569282275010509,Positive
Absolutely. Yes. No in this call it really affirms I mean sort of the direction. And I think the strategies are advancing.,SLRX,0.9210220575332642,0.842044020917428,Positive

Before I speak to our results I want to acknowledge what an unprecedented year 2020 was. At this time last year we have little idea how much COVID would impact our business and our lives. So many of our customers crew and fellow citizens were and remain deeply impacted by the pandemic. Our thoughts and prayers remain with them especially those who lost loved ones.,FIVE,0.01547372341156,-0.9690537268243593,Negative

Now turning to the fourth quarter our Q4 results exceeded the guidance we announced in conjunction with our holiday sales release. Sales were strong leading up to that announcement and accelerated in January fueled by the second round of stimulus.,FIVE,0.7532827258110046,0.5065651575119243,Positive
We delivered fourth quarter sales of 858.5 million or growth of nearly 25 and earnings per share grew nearly 12 to 2.20. Comparable sales were remarkable 13.8 representing the best Q4 comp we have ever achieved. Our ecommerce business continues to grow at a pace significantly faster than our stores however due to the small base the overwhelming majority of our comps still comes from our stores.,FIVE,0.8894458413124084,0.7788915508339112,Positive
With respect to new stores which remain our top growth opportunity we opened two stores in the fourth quarter for a total of 120 net new stores opened across 32 states in 2020. Notably our Bronx New York store performed in the top 25 holiday grand openings even with the more restrictive environment and reduced marketing. We ended the year with 1020 stores a nearly fivefold increase when we went public in July of 2012 and leaving a long runway for growth to reach the 2500 plus total store potential we continue to see in the United States.,FIVE,0.9726144075393676,0.9452287824325454,Positive
Before I speak to the specifics about the fourth quarter I want to mention the key holiday selling period and acknowledge that both internal and external factors contributed to our strong performance. While our team did an outstanding job ensuring a safe smooth and successful holiday we have benefited from external factors such as a favorable calendar and the ongoing shift in consumer spending from areas like travel and entertainment.,FIVE,0.9973691701889038,0.9947383372416123,Positive
Regarding the internal factors from a merchandising perspective the trendright amazing value products in our stores resonated with our customers. We saw broad based strength throughout the store especially in our room style sports and tech worlds. The trends related COVID we experienced throughout the year continued. Room and tech benefited from the work and playathome trend while style captured the direct COVID impact of customers buying masks and hand sanitizers among other items.,FIVE,0.9999083280563354,0.9998166560033894,Positive
Five Beyond also contributed to sales both through the permanent offering in new stores and remodels as well as the seasonal Five Beyond wall that was in all our stores for the holidays for the second year.,FIVE,0.8086647987365723,0.6173293693836746,Positive
On the marketing front we continued the shift to digital and fully eliminated our paper circulars while decreasing our TV reach to approximately 25 of stores. As previously mentioned we stopped our holiday campaign early this year to avoid big crowds in stores given our desire to provide a safe shopping environment for everyone.,FIVE,0.9990915060043336,0.9981830109256573,Positive
On the digital front we are focused on increasing our brand awareness and conversion through more targeted marketing focusing on the acquisition and retention of our customers through various search and social platforms. In addition we piloted tests with Instacart allowing us to offer our customers more flexible options to shop at our stores.,FIVE,0.8659836649894714,0.7319671702189268,Positive
With respect to infrastructure our distribution center in Conroe Texas became fully operational and was a big factor in helping to serve our stores in Texas and further west more quickly and efficiently. Without a doubt the Conroe facility helped us achieve the smoothest holiday we have ever experienced.,FIVE,0.9998669028282166,0.9997338054977689,Positive
On the ecommerce front the addition of our Ohio fulfillment center was vital to serving increased customer demand online.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Now turning to the year sales overall for 2020 were nearly 2 billion with earnings per share of 2.20. We accomplished so much during 2020 while quickly pivoting to adapt to the new environment and new ways of working. None of this would have been possible without our incredible team who I am so personally proud of. Their agility grit and resilience enabled us to close and safely reopen our entire fleet of existing stores in record pace as well as complete our new store opening plans and achieve our 1000store milestone.,FIVE,0.2160252928733825,-0.5679503488244706,Negative
We accomplished all of this while making strides against our key strategic priorities namely product experience and supply chain while continuing to innovate.,FIVE,0.98839670419693,0.9767933945616454,Positive
Let me highlight some of the accomplishments. Number one we deepened our commitment to gaming with our first exclusive product collaboration with Bugha and opened three Localhost test stores adjacent to our stores.,FIVE,0.91877543926239,0.8375507816975005,Positive

We also upgraded our new warehouse management system in Pedricktown to support our store growth in the Northeast.,FIVE,0.9999752044677734,0.9999504089059883,Positive
Now let me turn to 2021. We are really excited for this year and the return to a more normalized store growth program with plans to open 170 to 180 stores across 33 states in fiscal 2021. In fact as of today we have already opened 34 new stores including two more opening this week.,FIVE,0.9673457145690918,0.9346913902112188,Positive
This year we will be entering the states of Utah and New Mexico bringing the states we operate in to 40. By the end of the year Texas Florida California and New York will have now surpassed our home state of Pennsylvania in terms of the number of Five Below stores and we expect to continue to densify and grow in these states.,FIVE,0.9981523156166076,0.9963046290306024,Positive
We are also excited to continue to play offense execute with discipline and make progress in furthering our strategic initiatives. Allow me to elaborate. First as it relates to product it all starts with the WOW factor that is our customer promise. Innovation and agility are core to Five Below. Adjusting to customer needs and new trends is what Five Below does very well as we demonstrated during COVID.,FIVE,0.9997966289520264,0.9995932576616153,Positive
Let me give you a little more color on what we are doing with Five Beyond and product collaborations. The emergence of Five Beyond from our Ten Below tests is a great example how we pivoted to play offense. The customer has responded positively to our new Five Beyond assortment which is filled with fresh amazing value items and new categories to our customers.,FIVE,0.9670652151107788,0.9341303909602112,Positive
In 2020 the Five Beyond permanent section was in approximately 140 stores and we plan to more than double that number in 2021 making it available in approximately 30 of our chain by yearend. We also plan to add the Five Beyond wall in all stores in select New Seasons like we did in January with the wellness offering.,FIVE,0.861486554145813,0.7229729431706329,Positive
In addition were working on exclusive online items as part of the overall Five Beyond offering. As to product collaborations we plan to expand the Bugha gaming offerings as well as do more exclusive collaborations in 2021.

We plan to create more opportunities like these in other areas cross our stores.,FIVE,0.9995591640472412,0.9991183275689648,Positive
Second as it relates to experience our goal is to elevate the experience for both our customers and our crew. How do we do that We do that through innovation both in store and digitally. In store we are featuring a new prototype with Five Beyond in the backend store to build new stores and remodels. While our Localhost test was temporarily interrupted by COVID we will restart this initiative to continue to add more Localhost locations in 2021. We continue to be pleased with our partnership with Nerd Street Gamers and see them emerging as a leader in eSports. Expect us to continue to expand our capabilities in gaming.,FIVE,0.9997347593307496,0.9994695183453075,Positive
We also added a system selfcheckout to over 250 more stores including the majority of new stores and remodels bringing the total stores with assisted selfcheckout to about 60 of our chain. This allows us to move our crew from behind the register to the floor to assist our customers with their shopping journey which makes for a better customer experience overall.,FIVE,0.9320361614227296,0.8640722418262019,Positive

In addition we remodeled 45 stores during the fiscal year.,FIVE,0.9969976544380188,0.9939953052969606,Positive
Comparable sales increased to record 13.8 for the fourth quarter of 2020 versus a 2.2 comparable sales decrease in the fourth quarter of 2019. The fourth quarter of 2019 was impacted by six fewer holiday shopping days. The comp increase for the fourth quarter was driven by a 15.9 increase in comp average ticket partially offset by a 1.8 decrease in comp transactions.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our holiday comparable sales through the first nine weeks of the quarter increased 10.1 and sales accelerated in January driven by the second round of government stimulus.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Gross profit increased 17.9 to 340.9 million from 289.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. Gross margin finished to 39.7 decreasing approximately 240 basis points from the record 42.1 last year.,FIVE,0.0866778194904327,-0.8266454497846663,Negative
As expected the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by sales mix impacted by customer preferences from pandemicrelated items which was partially offset by leveraging store occupancy costs from a higher sales.,FIVE,0.0154626071453094,-0.9690759593701121,Negative
SGA expenses as a percentage of sales for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased approximately 120 basis points to 20 from 21.1 in the fourth quarter of 2019 largely due to the intentional pullback in marketing as Joel discussed.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In addition we leveraged fixed costs while higher incentive compensation compared to last year was a partial offset.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 26.6 compared to 23.6 in the fourth quarter of 2019.

For fiscal 2020 total net sales were 1.96 billion an increase of 6.2. Comparable sales decreased 5.5 versus a comparable sales increase of sixtenths of a percent in 2019. This comparable sales decrease was driven by a reduction in transactions due primarily to the pandemicrelated store closures in the first and second quarters.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Gross profit for the full year decreased 3.2 to 652.3 million. Gross margin decreased by approximately 330 to 33.2 driven primarily by lower merchandise margins and deleverage of occupancy expenses due to the pandemic driven store closures during the firsthalf of the year.,FIVE,0.0005368590354919,-0.998927473382636,Negative
SGA expenses as a percentage of sales for the year increased approximately 60 basis points to 25.4 from 24.7 in 2019 due primarily to deleverage of fixed costs and corporate expenses due to the store closures offset in part by a reduction of marketing expenses.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Lower invested cash balances and interest rates combined with temporary draw downs and higher costs on the line of credit resulted in a net interest expense in 2020 versus net interest income in 2019.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In addition in 2020 weve recognized the full year of a prorata loss related to our noncontrolling interest in Nerd Street Gamers.,FIVE,0.8720579743385315,0.7441157961581923,Positive
Our effective tax rate for the year was 19.4 compared to 21 in 2019. The lower than planned tax rate in both years was primarily due to the benefit of share based accounting.,FIVE,0.05805504322052,-0.8838910364455203,Negative
Diluted earnings per share was 2.20 for fiscal 2020 a decrease of 29.5 versus diluted earnings per share of 3.12 for fiscal 2019. Diluted earnings per share included an 0.08 benefit from share based accounting in 2020 and a 0.14 benefit in 2019.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

Inventory at the end of the year was 281.3 million as compared to 324 million at the end of fiscal 2019. Ending inventory on a per store basis decreased approximately 23 yearoveryear against elevated inventory balances at the end of fiscal 2019 which were the result of lower fourth quarter sales and accelerated tariffrelated receipts.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In addition ending inventory for fiscal 2020 was impacted by higher than expected fourth quarter sell through this year as well as delayed inventory receipts resulting from global supply chain disruptions due to elevated product demand and congestion at ports.,FIVE,0.0830788016319274,-0.833843489792043,Negative
With respect to CapEx we spent approximately 200 million in gross CapEx in fiscal 2020 excluding tenant allowances. This reflected the cost of opening the new Texas distribution center and payments on the new Arizona distribution center opening 122 new stores completing 45 remodels and investments in systems and infrastructure.,FIVE,0.1087844669818878,-0.7824321284485629,Negative
Now I would like to turn to 2021. We are providing first quarter guidance but due to the continued uncertainty related to both the ongoing impact of COVID19 and potential future shifts in consumer spending we are unable to provide a formal full year sales and earnings guidance for 2021. However I will offer directional commentary on how we are viewing the year.,FIVE,0.0321948528289794,-0.9356114480563691,Negative
This first quarter will be very different than last year when we closed our stores due to the pandemic on March 20 the Friday following our fourth quarter earnings call. These store closures resulted in the loss of sales for last years Easter and spring season. With Easter on April 4 this year we are currently in the key selling weeks for the quarter. Last year the pandemic was declared on Wednesday March 11. And we reported a 2.9 comparable sales increase for that quarter to date period.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the same period this year comparable sales increased 12.3. Based on our current trajectory and the expected benefit to sales from the third round of government stimulus we expect first quarter sales to be in the range of 540 million to 560 million. We expect to open approximately 60 stores in the first quarter as Joel mentioned we are already over halfway there.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of 0.66 to 0.68. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is planned to approximately 25 and it excludes the impact of share based accounting or any share repurchases.,FIVE,0.861869215965271,0.7237382672657175,Positive
As you know our practice is to update the tax rate outlook quarterly with actual results when we report earnings.,FIVE,0.0606932640075683,-0.8786145917264175,Negative
For the full fiscal year of 2021 although we are not providing formal sales and EPS guidance we would like to provide a framework for how we are thinking about the year. We expect it to be a more normalized year from a growth and operating margin perspective. Accordingly we view fiscal 2019 as a better comparison year for fiscal 2021 than the pandemic impacted fiscal 2020.,FIVE,0.8394542932510376,0.6789083951165646,Positive
In a scenario where sales growth reflects a two year compound growth rate in the high teens we would expect fiscal 2021 operating margin to be relatively flat to fiscal 2019. We expect the secondhalf of fiscal 2021 to be a difficult comparison as we lapped a very strong secondhalf in 2020 when sales grew 25 and comparable sales were at a record high of 13.5.,FIVE,0.7560333013534546,0.5120663118757676,Positive
With regards to nonoperating results our minority interest in Nerd Street Gamers is also expected to have a larger yearonyear negative impact resulting in a net other expense of approximately 0.06. And we are currently planning an effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 of 25.,FIVE,0.9440698623657228,0.8881396580574861,Positive
For stores we expect to open 170 to 180 new stores and complete approximately 30 to 35 remodels in fiscal 2021 with approximately 90 to 100 new stores opening in the firsthalf of the year. We are planning to spend approximately 315 million in gross capital expenditures excluding the impact of tenant allowances. This reflects opening a new distribution center in Arizona and beginning construction on a new distribution center in the Midwest along with opening new stores and executing remodels and investing in systems and infrastructure. For all other details related to our results please refer to our earnings press release.,FIVE,0.9843407273292542,0.9686814359911895,Positive
And with that I would like to turn the call back over to Joel to provide some closing comments before we open it up for questions. Joel,FIVE,0.9585222005844116,0.9170443517234037,Positive
Yes. Thanks Ken. In summary we are very pleased with our performance overall in 2020. We played offense and acted quickly to position ourselves for success. We made difficult decisions while always keeping our customers and our crew at the forefront. The experience of 2020 has again demonstrated the strength of our proven model with the inherent flexibility of our Eight Worlds and our unique merchandising approach.,FIVE,0.9999908208847046,0.9999816417584668,Positive
Im pleased with how well we connected with our customers and communities including providing for those in need to our Toys for Tots Alex Lemonade St. Jude Chop Hospital and other donation programs. All of this has made us an even stronger company and we enter 2021 with great momentum. We are wellpositioned for growth and less than halfway to our 2500 plus store target.,FIVE,0.9999802112579346,0.9999604224922791,Positive
Were really excited for 2021 to build on our progress deliver on our customer promise and relentlessly raise the bar as we continue to grow our amazing company this year and beyond.,FIVE,0.9796222448349,0.9592444653776084,Positive
With that Id like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions. But must remind you that we had a lot to share with you today and we really need to stick to one question per analyst. With that operator,FIVE,0.9804806709289552,0.9609613185890431,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you. We will now begin the questionandanswer session. Operator Instructions And our first question today will come from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.9986777305603028,0.9973554595443368,Positive
Hey everyone its Simeon Gutman. My question is on incremental margins and I guess EBIT margins broadly. In Q1 I was going to ask around incremental margins. Its hard to do the yearoveryear comparison but it looks like the implied EBIT margin is in the 8 to 8.5 range which is considerably better than the 7 from Q1 I think of 2019.,FIVE,0.2237798273563385,-0.5524412706144277,Negative
Can you tell us because we cant really see what the incremental is Is there anything in the 8 to 8.5 implied thats being conservative if theres anything thats holding you back in the first quarter in terms of flow through,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And then bigger picture is there anything that you see changing the comp leverage point of the business broadly This is really beyond 21 or maybe even the backhalf of 21. Because I think youve told us 3 in the past so curious how that algorithm may change going forward,FIVE,0.9333715438842772,0.866743008341198,Positive
Yes. Thanks Simeon. Ill answer the second part of your question first around our leverage points as we move forward. As you mentioned it is going to be an unusual year anniversarying 2020 but our impression and our  what we see here from a leverage point going forward we have said before about a 3 comp ex any meaningful investment for a year and you should start to see leverage on the business. So I think that still continues to be what we see and that holds true.,FIVE,0.9999959468841552,0.9999918937634786,Positive
Relative to the first quarter again as you mentioned its very difficult to make a comparison  really hard to make a comparison up against Q1 20 given the store closures but I think you mentioned Q1 2019 and what were seeing at least right now versus Q1 19 you would have  for the most part probably gross margins are relatively flat and we see some meaningful lift in leverage over Q1 2019 on SGA and that would really be the driver you would call out an estimate of leverage with 2019 and we park ph that overwhelming majority that will be coming in SGA.,FIVE,0.9500079154968262,0.900015771398408,Positive
Thank you.,FIVE,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
Thank you Simeon.,FIVE,0.9314355850219728,0.8628710883087449,Positive
And your next question will come from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi guys. Happy St. Patricks Day. And my question is on new customer acquisition particularly in light of the better traffic performance in the fourth quarter relative to the past couple of quarters. So when you look at 2020 and those that chopped you for the first time for PPE or supplies curious if theres a way to isolate that cohort and maybe compare them to the gains that you saw over the past five years with say Rainbow Looms and the Spinner Craze Thanks.,FIVE,0.9999029636383056,0.9998059271609347,Positive
Happy St. Patricks Day to you too Chuck. I got my green on here. I am looking at Ken and I think its a really  this is great question you asked. Indiscernible the one youre really isolated because unlike when theres other trends going on its pretty easy to isolate because its really the only thing going on.,FIVE,0.9625812768936156,0.9251625091806106,Positive
But in addition to customer mix changes and costs associated with PPE and then just reopening times and then shopping patterns and our closing times being off I think theres just so much noise in it.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And I think thats why rather than specific guidance on the year we focus so much on making sure that the message got back to you that we really feel like were back to normal operating margins and 2019 certainly a much more normalized year but its really hard to specifically isolate what youre asking for Chuck and I hope that helps you get a little clarity around that.,FIVE,0.205104261636734,-0.5897924243166592,Negative
Yes.,FIVE,0.7864110469818115,0.5728218393455979,Positive
Thanks Chuck.,FIVE,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
And our next question will come from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks and congrats on another great quarter guys. So Joel as we think about the best backhalf comps I think for the company in basically a decade what do you attribute companyspecific to the recent inflection and performance,FIVE,0.9834574460983276,0.9669148724763825,Positive
And then as we exit the pandemic I guess how would you rank opportunities as we think about accelerating market share on the other side more It goes back I think the last couple of quarters youve talked about taking a more offensive approach. What  maybe just elaborate on different opportunities you see to do that,FIVE,0.8614736199378967,0.7229470747393816,Positive
Yes thanks Matt. And I mean clearly we were very forthright about acknowledging both internal and external factors and I think as you look at the nineweek period the 10ish comp that acceleration where the quarter ended at 13.8 we attributed the overwhelming majority of that to external forces the second stimulus.,FIVE,0.223468005657196,-0.5530649143844334,Negative
But if you work backwards to the holiday and then as well as what were seeing in the first quarter I think what youre starting to see Matt is a lot of offense coming together to work certainly Five Beyond played a very large piece of that. Our assortment the merchants really pivoted nicely and if you think of the pandemic as a trend kind of a weird way to categorize it but our job when something emerges is to move the merchandising mix and I called out specific examples in both style and room how the customers buying patterns change.,FIVE,0.9911446571350098,0.982289303713622,Positive
And I think if we had stayed the same we wouldnt have seen quite the lift we saw in the back half of the year. So look these Eight Worlds continue to serve us well Matt and it allows us to pivot into wherever the trend may be and this was emphasized in especially room as people stayed home and there was a lot more room product bought than weve probably ever seen before.,FIVE,0.816745400428772,0.6334905824009076,Positive
So clearly the run up at the end was external but the overwhelming majority of that first nine week holiday was us being nimble and reacting to trends we saw and the merchant team continues to do a great job. The planners got back out in the market and we rebought after cancelling hundreds of millions of goods. And Ill tell you the team Matt really operated on all cylinders to kind of salvage what started out as probably the toughest start to the year weve ever seen and weve finished 20 with momentum and we entered 21 now with great momentum as well. Thanks Matt.,FIVE,0.999660849571228,0.999321698738157,Positive
And our next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Guys how do you think about phasing investments right in product and marketing I guess specifically through the year You got the easy compares you got stimulus the same firepower and point things more towards the secondhalf by design and those type of investments. How do you sort of gauge the elasticity of either one product or marketing if you pointed them to the backhalf the year,FIVE,0.9320279359817504,0.8640557909344377,Positive
Well John great question. I think specifically on the marketing one what youre really seeing is we believe were kind of back to a more normalized marketing spend which historically has been 2 to 3. And while we pull back in the backhalf of last year weve pulled back in the fronthalf of this year. But well shift that back into the backhalf of next year. And I think its somewhat become something that we can really use as needed. But I think our base marketing remains two to three and we stay focused on that piece of it.,FIVE,0.999391794204712,0.9987835876843858,Positive
On the product side Im not sure Im following John what youre asking about that that shift there.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Well just is there more of a focus on new product introductions and particularly Five Beyond in the backhalf to generate more buzz with profits ph than you may need in the firsthalf.,FIVE,0.9698252081871032,0.9396503804030298,Positive
No look I mean you know Michael and his team. And theres always product innovation. It tends to probably show itself more in the backhalf of the year craze is excluded because we come out of holiday we really see new things emerge new buying habits and then the merchants spend the fronthalf of the year chasing those and really pivoting for the backhalf a year.,FIVE,0.8174698352813721,0.6349394529697019,Positive
Now if a craze emerges like Spinner was one that we were in talking about on March 17. And that was more about us just operating the speed. But in general product innovations Bugha is a great example of one. We read a lot we observed the many new trends around gaming and the buyers are back out in the marketplace buying now new product assortment and just the cycle of its largely going to show up in the backhalf again. And I think that continues to kind of be the flywheel we see with the product innovations in general.,FIVE,0.9999825954437256,0.9999651908667033,Positive
Thanks John.,FIVE,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
And our next question will come from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good evening. Thanks all for taking my question. Can you break down the ticket growth you saw in 4Q between UPT and AUR And what drove those pieces And given those dynamics and the likelihood that retail traffic it will likely improve over the course of the year should we think about Five Below now having a structurally higher comp than a 3.3 if average from 2015 to 2019,FIVE,0.9999114871025084,0.9998229740995013,Positive
Yes. Thanks Michael. Just on your ticket component question. I think I mentioned the increase we saw was just over 15. When you dive a little bit deeper into that it really is really from both UPTs and the average unit retail increases. And then the second part of your question I didnt quite understand around the historical.,FIVE,0.9997401237487792,0.9994802471877615,Positive
Yes. The second piece is should we think about Five Below having a structurally higher level of same store sales growth moving forward. Because its clear that you figured out how to drive ticket growth. And as traffic returns youll be able to retain this growth in ticket. And that will lead to a structurally higher level of same store sales growth moving forward that Five Below has achieved in the past.,FIVE,0.9989789724349976,0.9979579436528347,Positive
Yes. I think from a longerterm perspective and thats a difficult question to answer at this point. I think just going out into this year I think the one thing just to recall and I think Joel and I both mentioned in the content our comments just a significant challenge were going to have in the backhalf of the year up against the record performance that we had last year.,FIVE,0.9930437803268432,0.9860875523612214,Positive
But again as we look further out we would expect a more kind of normalized part of the business. Where that comes from It could be a combination of both transactions and ticket. I mean thats just something well have to see. But its hard to really peg anything much longer and further.,FIVE,0.7838313579559326,0.5676624582186092,Positive
Yes I think Michael that is a great question. And I think you just got to give us a little time in some more normal times to kind of see what that long range impact on things like Five Beyond are where we can now change that growth trajectory. But weve got to get through this ambiguous period consumer shifts back to services. And so some of that might just play a bigger play until we get beyond it.,FIVE,0.923551380634308,0.8471026701347055,Positive
But what youre alluding to is exactly how were thinking about the business. And I think that I call it play offense many of those initiatives are really starting to come together both in product and marketing that ecommerce a lot of those that can potentially drive that. But weve got  you need to give us a little bit more time to kind of watch what happens here and forecasts that out.,FIVE,0.2157904803752899,-0.5684199741005744,Negative
Got it. Makes sense. Thank you very much.,FIVE,0.9992408752441406,0.9984817495833336,Positive
Hey. Thanks Mike. Appreciate it.,FIVE,0.9999722242355348,0.9999444484379583,Positive
And our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi guys. Good afternoon. You mentioned on the call Joel that the densification of stores in certain states and now youre going to be in 40 states. Is there any way to quantify the benefit you guys get from that densification strategy whether its sales because of brand awareness or maybe at the margin line because you can better leverage expenses like marketing and distribution Just any color on that would be helpful just given the expansion process that you guys are going through,FIVE,0.9992729425430298,0.9985458842193391,Positive
Yes. Its really both Scott. And I mean sorry about the ambiguity on some of this just because all the noise last year. But look I think the one thing we are seeing is our brand awareness is something weve always been watching and its been rather low. But what weve really seen yearoveryear is our brand awareness in kind of markets anywhere open from two to seven years is moving up 3 to 100 to 500 basis points faster than it used to.,FIVE,0.140250563621521,-0.7194998976587639,Negative
And so I cant specifically due to all the noise last year tell you its because of densification. We internally believe that. And weve shared with you cannibalization closer to 100 bps a year. And were not afraid of that because I think the payoffs around awareness and picking up market share far outweigh the slight cannibalization from individual stores. But directionally its really impacting both and were seeing that show up in brand awareness.,FIVE,0.9551252126693726,0.910250371843798,Positive
Thanks Scott.,FIVE,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thanks guys.,FIVE,0.9966442584991456,0.9932885129979332,Positive
And our next question will come from Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey thanks guys. Curious if you can talk about anything noteworthy on the inflation front. If so if you are seeing some inflation which parts of the assortment and just whats the plan of attack Thanks.,FIVE,0.9987181425094604,0.9974362834908268,Positive
Right now Paul our overall inflation were feeling is relatively flat. I mean theres certainly pressure on the supply chain side but were also seeing opportunities in the real estate side. And I think it all mixes out. Weve through our scale and everything weve been able to hold it relatively in check and hence kind of guide to relatively flat operating margin. I dont know Ken,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. Paul I think Joel hit. There obviously are cost increases throughout the business and whether its supply chain products or otherwise. But we always go back to the scale benefit that we have to be able to offset and mitigate those and even the way we operate which is maybe a little bit different than some other retailers. And Joel has mentioned freight and we all know about whats going on out there in freight and supply chain disruptions.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
And credit out to the team getting out ahead of that from a negotiating standpoint and locking up our contracts earlier both in a rate and capacity perspective. So although we are seeing increases its probably not as much as other businesses out there.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So really a combination of being nimble with our vendors and negotiating and navigating all that combined with scale really help us to either offset or mitigate the increases that are out there.,FIVE,0.921771228313446,0.8435423633708736,Positive
Thanks Paul.,FIVE,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thanks. Good luck.,FIVE,0.9989014863967896,0.997802971484048,Positive
And our next question will come from Karen Short with Barclays. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi thanks very much. I just wanted to go to the comps in the quarter versus your comments on comps in the quarter todate pre closing for the pandemic. So I kind of get to January comp in like the mid to high 20 range. And then I think can you comment on the comps pre closing were in the 12.3 range.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So I guess what Im wondering is that kind of the right way to look at the spread or the impacts differently from the stimulus And I asked that in the context that March stimulus will obviously be much more impactful dollar wise than January.,FIVE,0.9813960194587708,0.9627920167398551,Positive
And then the follow up I just had on that is is there any way to quantify the impact of Five Beyond on comps Thanks.,FIVE,0.0998458564281463,-0.8003093602117064,Negative
Yes. Thanks Karen. Your math around your estimates around the comps are pretty reasonable. I mean I think you could probably kind of do the math knowing that where we were in total sales through the nine weeks and then what we provided in total sales for the quarter and then the 10 comp for the nine weeks versus the 13.8 for the quarter. Yes I think youre in a pretty reasonable range there.,FIVE,0.9999891519546508,0.9999783038963697,Positive
And again the impact of stimulus payments they are always tough to measure and gauge whether it would be the magnitude or the extent how long they last. And as we mentioned in the guidance that we gave for Q1 this year it did include our estimate of a benefit from the third round of stimulus in the quarter but I would say your estimates are relatively reasonable.,FIVE,0.9749241471290588,0.9498482643653539,Positive
Thanks Karen.,FIVE,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
Thanks Karen.,FIVE,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
And our next question will come from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hey guys nice quarter. I want to just to followup on stimulus here. Ken Im just curious within the Q1 guidance what you are assuming for that stimulus benefit,FIVE,0.9621042013168336,0.924208357458328,Positive
And then as a followup to that how positive do you believe the increase in the child tax credit will be for you later in this year given that it looks like its coming in monthly payments this summer I would imagine that I dont know the majority of your customers living in households with kids. Just kind of curious as to how youre maybe thinking about that as well,FIVE,0.9948759078979492,0.9897518096875011,Positive
Yes. Thanks Ed. As I mentioned and Karen asked the last question too around our guidance does include an estimate for the benefit from the third round of stimulus. I really dont want to get into specific amounts in terms of whats embedded in that number at the end of the day. I mean you know how we guide in terms of the total number for the quarter and how were seeing it.,FIVE,0.994820475578308,0.989640944982138,Positive
I can tell you that its well less than what the consensus was prior to this call. In other words what we reported and what the consensus from the analysts were. So it was well well less than that.,FIVE,0.9303466081619264,0.8606931332904897,Positive
With regards to the childcare credit yes I mean those are the types of things that impact as Joel in his remarks had mentioned theres always internal and external factors. And thats an external factor that if theres any change in policy in mandates out there or benefits from taxes. We have seen historically that that could benefit our business to an increase because normally thats an increase overall traffic or spending. And we benefit in that similar to what weve seen in the second round of stimulus and currently in the third round of stimulus. So yes if the rules change that way it could end up impacting our traffic during the summer time.,FIVE,0.9981861114501952,0.9963722207380654,Positive
Now keep in mind though other things could be happening too. I mean its really hard to predict around the COVID19 and the vaccines and then where overall consumer spending goes as entertainment and travel may start to  spending on that may start to increase.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes. I mean Ed its clearly a tailwind for us. But its also one that we dont have a lot of data points on why we felt important to be more directional on the year. And I do but hopefully everyones taken away is we provide you our new stores which make up historically 80 of our growth. You know the cadence on them how were thinking about the bottomline and growth rates. And so it starts to triangulate it in a pretty predictable number.,FIVE,0.8363903164863586,0.6727804379346596,Positive
And now we have to add in the pluses and takes of some of these external events but most of them seem to be tailwinds. But we also got to watch shift in consumer behavior the other way too. And were controlling what we can control. And it feels great to be back to growth cycle again. And were in a pretty good position going into the end of first quarter here. Thanks Ed.,FIVE,0.9994255304336548,0.998851060182488,Positive

And our next question will come from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Hi. Congratulations on successfully navigating an extremely difficult year. If you could show some more colors on inventory levels you exited the quarter down 13. Would you say that hindered your ability to capture some sales in the fourth quarter and you had to leave some on the table. And then what gives you confidence in managing that especially given all the challenges going on globally as you think about first half of the year and likely into the secondhalf as well Thank you.,FIVE,0.9999955892562866,0.9999911785073152,Positive
Yes. Thanks Chandni. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks we were down about 23 on a yearoveryear basis from average store. And again a couple things were going on there. One you got to look at last year when we were up probably half of that related to the sales and then also we moved inventory in earlier tariff related inventory to avoid some tariffs there. And then you kind of flip to this year when we oversold right and had some a tremendous sell throughs there in the fourth quarter.,FIVE,0.9934072494506836,0.9868144910421914,Positive
And then some delayed receipts. I think Joel mentioned the two where we are seeing some delays related to that global supply chain disruption. But I got to tell you the team is managing it very well. We dont see a material impact of that related to Q1 based on the guidance and the sales that we provided. I guess more to come on that as we move through the year. But right now we feel like were in pretty good position with that and again navigating that pretty well with our vendors and then also with the to our supply chain.,FIVE,0.9999024868011476,0.9998049734860504,Positive
Thank you.,FIVE,0.966345489025116,0.9326909379309045,Positive
And our next question will come from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made on Five Beyond I think adding more frequent to WOW wall Can you just talk a little bit about the strategy and if theres a chance that we will see those permanent pictures throughout the fleet at some point this year,FIVE,0.9999992847442628,0.999998569487673,Positive
Yes. Great question. And let me just refresh everybody on where were at with Five Beyond. Because theres actually two components at this point in time. Theres the Five Beyond prototype and then theres what we affectionately call the Wow Wall thats in the rest of the chain. And so our go forward prototype for the class of 21 will  for the most part all new stores and remodels will now incorporate Five Beyond in the back of the store.,FIVE,0.9995762705802916,0.9991525406554582,Positive
And then the Wow Wall will be used at seasonal times throughout the rest of the chain. I think its less about it being in the rest of the chain all year round. And its more about us continuing to convert and shift more and more stores to Five Beyond prototype.,FIVE,0.96927809715271,0.938556157682036,Positive
Were obviously pretty pleased with it. We like where its going. But I also am very respectful who our customer is what our brand stands for. And I want to walk really carefully with not violating that agreement we have with the customer namely Five the World. And so I think the feedback weve gotten from them is they love Five Beyond they love the value the Wow factor keep delivering that but also keep it separate and segregated.,FIVE,0.9999885559082032,0.999977111802764,Positive
And so we think weve found a nice happy way to do that with seasonal in and out Wow presentations and yet moving ahead very quickly. I mean 30 of our chain will now have the Five Beyond prototype at the end of year. And so thats the nice balance with it. Well watch it. Could it change over time Maybe. But I think were on a pretty good path right now moving towards this new prototype and then dropping in some Wow from kind of the timing in the fleet.,FIVE,0.9922261238098145,0.9844522383524408,Positive
Ken anything on this there,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative

And our next question will come from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Let me add my congratulations as well on a strong finish to the year. So my question you talked about the fact that you fully eliminated your  your paper circulars and you pull back your marketing in 25 of your stores. I mean obviously this is sort of sort of an extraordinary year. But I guess what are your thoughts as you think about marketing going forward I mean Im assuming youre probably not were going to do paper circulars anymore. But I guess how do you think about your TV  TV ads going forward given the fact you just did your best comping company history when you did pull your TV advertising back thank you.,FIVE,0.9996066093444824,0.9992132182200064,Positive
Yeah. Hey thanks for the support Anthony. And look it we were already on the journey to reduce our dependence on paper. And clearly the pandemic allowed us to accelerate that. Were not going back. Were pretty pleased where were at. But I think what we also learned is where we were heading done a pretty strong path of national TV the consumer behavior shifted a lot. And we had much more success with some of our more targeted digital. And so I think as we sit here today pending consumer shift again thatll be the path we will go down.,FIVE,0.9999654293060304,0.9999308585708493,Positive
Weve seen the opportunity to not have to spend as much marketing but I think theres still the opportunity for use of performance marketing and reaching into some of our social paid platforms. But as for right now I mean were in a more normalized 2 to 3 and I think need another change I think Id kind of hold it towards there to a reasonable number that gives us the right leverage. But were certainly always looking for ways to be more efficient. I think the stuff weve taken out is setting us up nicely.,FIVE,0.8595275282859802,0.719054889115625,Positive
Thanks Anthony.,FIVE,0.9717549085617064,0.94350978345262,Positive
And our next question will come from Jeremy Hamblin with CraigHallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thanks guys Ill add my congratulations. I wanted to talk on Nerd Street and just with the vaccine really accelerating here and maybe coming a little sooner or maybe quite a bit sooner than people were anticipating several months ago do you have a sense on how that may evolve here in the back half of the year in terms of maybe being a little bit more front and center for testing and expanding that initiative,FIVE,0.9997895956039428,0.9995791909570637,Positive
Obviously you provided the 0.06 drag to EPS for the year but any additional color you can share on how youre looking at that rollout as it stands for 2021 or is that something youre kind of punting down the road to 22,FIVE,0.990913987159729,0.9818279634880802,Positive
Well Ken was here in 1980 ph and I wasnt. So he  no I am just kidding Jeremy. You can just tell by our comments during the prepared remarks that we really tried to focus on what we can control and tell you how were thinking about the business and quite honestly how we think were back to our growth algorithm.,FIVE,0.9991840124130248,0.9983680238533159,Positive
You just gave one great example. We could probably sit here and go to two or three other external factors and argue about whether theyre tailwinds or headwinds. And I think theyre going to play out. Were going to see some ups and downs. Netnet I think overall theres probably more pluses and minuses out there. But I think what the message I want to leave with you and the rest of the analysts is Five Below is getting back to what we can control and get back to more normal business. And were going to keep playing offense and innovating this awesome concept and making it better than ever. So I hope that gives you enough clarity. But thats kind of how were thinking about it.,FIVE,0.999854326248169,0.9997086523226812,Positive
Thanks guys. Good luck.,FIVE,0.999835729598999,0.9996714590021722,Positive
And our next question will come from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.,FIVE,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good afternoon. Just on stores just a question on any metrics that you can provide as we think about your new store prototype regarding productivity or returns relative to the rest of the base. And also with you kind of breaking ground on the digital center that are open next year just curious what will be kind of capacity in terms of what you can support through the DC system in 2022,FIVE,0.9999662041664124,0.9999324082925369,Positive
Yes thanks Paul. Taking the back half of that on the D.C. side in theory when the next one is up it certainly gives us the capacity to support all 2500 stores. Now that doesnt mean youll never hear us open another distribution center because at some point in time you also look at efficiencies and you want a smaller regional and say the Pacific Northwest or something. But our overwhelming heavy lift multiyear investment phase to which we were honestly kind of behind them were now ahead. And so I think we feel pretty good at that as we get Arizona open this year and the Midwest next year.,FIVE,0.998337745666504,0.9966754893514453,Positive
Store metrics are tough. I mean obviously stores getting more productive. We continue to see less in the remodels were doing. So we expect those productivity gains to continue to grow. Id ask for a little patience from you guys before we kind of give you specifics because weve been trying to parse it out and the remodels weve done and theres just so much noise from closed stores open stores states having different levels of shut downs stimulus money dropping in. But obviously we feel really good about it as youre seeing us move forward with this prototype and remodels.,FIVE,0.0622649192810058,-0.8754712793059823,Negative
Thanks Paul. And I think were wrapping up here and well end with Paul there. Really appreciate you getting on the call with us. Thanks everyone for joining.

We are looking forward to the end of what has been a long winter and hope there are many sunny days ahead for all of us. The global pandemic has profoundly impacted our lives and brought unforeseen challenges to our communities over the past year.

As I reflect on this past year Im struck by the achievements of our incredible team. The commitment and hard work of our colleagues at OTC Markets was above and beyond. Through it all our people remain connected and risen to the challenge of operating remotely. While experiencing unprecedented market volatility and trading volumes our team delivered excellent results served our clients and stayed connected. To the entire OTC Markets Group team thank you for your dedication and performance.

In 2020 we delivered strong performance for shareholders with gross revenues growing 13 and net income growing 22.

I would like to formally welcome our new CFO Antonio to our team. Antonio will cover our financial results in more detail in a few moments. Over the course of the year volatility in the U.S. equities markets led to record trade volumes on our OTC led ATS and OTC led ETN particularly in the second half of the year as we readily broke daily records. The sharp uptick in trading volume drove much of the growth for the ECM transactional business.,OTCM,0.9920217990875244,0.9840435886642864,Positive
We understand that system reliability remains paramount. Our markets must remain open and available and I am pleased to report that we fulfilled that responsibility yet again in 2020.

Our Corporate Services business provided the clearest indication of the impact of COVID19. We experienced a fairly significant dip in OTCQX and OTCQB sales early in the year when the economy began to react to the pandemic. Interest in our markets increased throughout the remainder of the year reinforcing the vital role we play as a global gateway for companies to access the US market in an efficient and cost effective way.,OTCM,0.97882342338562,0.9576468215267784,Positive
Companies on our OTCQX and OTCQB markets provide constant feedback on how we can continue to add value to their public trading experience. For example increased use of our virtual investor conferences highlights our ability to keep people connected in a remote working environment. Working with these companies and their investors deepens our commitment to a strategic vision for a future that is online datadriven and social.,OTCM,0.9999404549598694,0.9998809098487556,Positive

In September 2020 the SEC issued its final rule adopting amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15c211 with a compliance date upcoming in September 2021. We continue to work with the commission and SEC staff on the creation of an expert market a regulated electronic market for brokers and other sophisticated investors to continue interacting in securities that are no longer eligible for public broker dealer quotations under the rule. As we have advocated from the beginning amended rule of 15c211 should protect the property rights of minority investors and allow sophisticated investors to continue to access opportunities through their regulated broker dealer.,OTCM,0.9995360374450684,0.99907207433705,Positive
We also remain engaged with the SEC FINRA and others on the ongoing implementation of the Consolidated Audit Trail or CAT. A CAT reporting construct was created for exchange listed securities and still needs reporting framework that better aligns with our unique market structure. We are committed to providing our regulators with the information they need in an efficient and understandable format.,OTCM,0.9982657432556152,0.996531484443834,Positive
Our ability to thrive in a time of global uncertainty leaves us wellpositioned to seize business opportunities in the short and long term.

Three primary strategic initiatives will guide us through 2021.,OTCM,0.1685259938240051,-0.6629490035468362,Negative
First we must successfully implement changes related to amended rule 15c211. The rule that governs a broker dealers ability to quote a security on our markets the rule offers us an exciting opportunity to enhance the level of disclosure available for investors create efficiencies for broker dealers and bring more companies public onto our markets. This initiative requires collaboration from all aspects of our organization and well set the stage for us to execute our mission in the years to come.,OTCM,0.999956488609314,0.9999129771667583,Positive

I want to start by thanking our entire OTC Markets team for their continued commitment to supporting our clients and subscribers and delivering an uninterrupted service. I will now review our results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31 2020. Any reference made to prior period comparatives refers to the fourth quarter of 2019 or the year ended December 31 2019.,OTCM,0.994878590106964,0.9897571741087281,Positive
Our business delivered strong results despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions. For the fourth quarter of 2020 we generated 19.8 million in gross revenues up 23 with all three of our business lines delivering quarteroverquarter growth. In our OTC Link business revenues were up 73 driven by a very active trading environment throughout the quarter. Elevated market volumes combined with the impact of additional subscribers on boarded over the years drove a 429 increase in our quarterly ECN revenues.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The average daily transactions executed on OTC Link ECN increased over five times from the prior fourth quarter and reached over 20000 in the fourth quarter of 2020. OTC Link ECN ended the quarter with 73 subscribers which was a net increase of 20 compared to the prior yearend. We have continued to see elevated trading volume in January and February of this year as well in line with the broader US equity markets.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Revenues from our market data licensing business were up 18 driven by growth in users and price increases which we introduced at the beginning of the year. Revenues from professional users were up 18 from the prior quarter while revenues from nonprofessional users increased 73 reflecting a 60 quarteroverquarter increase in the ending number of users.,OTCM,0.9432930946350098,0.8865861216700803,Positive
Historically and in the normal course of our business operations we have also seen significant fluctuations in the number of nonprofessional users generally in response to volatility in the markets and increased retail trading interests. We have continued to also deliver revenue gains from our suite of compliance offerings which is the result of continued growth and the number of subscribers. As previously noted in September we launched our Blue Sky data product and we began onboarding subscribers in early 2021.,OTCM,0.999935269355774,0.9998705386343831,Positive
As market conditions normalized the current levels of trading volumes could decline and that interim could affect our trading revenues and we might also experience a decline in the number of professional and nonprofessional users of our data.,OTCM,0.828343391418457,0.6566865782061686,Positive
Turning to our Corporate Services business revenues in the quarter grew 6 mostly driven by our virtual investor conferences and disclosure and news services products which were up 372 and 14 respectively. Revenues from our OTCQX market were essentially flat quarteroverquarter.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We experienced a significant slowdown in sales in the first six months of the year. However we saw a strong rebound in the second half and finished the year with 34 OTCQX new additions in the fourth quarter up from 32 sales in the prior year quarter. We ended the current quarter with 461 companies on our OTCQX market which was up 19 companies compared to the prior year end.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
OTCQB revenues increased modestly by 1 similar to OTCQX OTCQB sales began slowly in the first quarter and accelerated throughout the year. We finished the year with 94 new companies added in the fourth quarter which was an increase of more than 2 times the new companies added in the prior year quarter. As a result we saw only a small decline in the number of OTCQB companies at the end of the current quarter to 902 companies compared to 907 at the prior year end. We continue to see these encouraging trends in terms of new sales and you show engagement continuing in the first quarter of 2021 and also have a strong pipeline of prospects.,OTCM,0.9979235529899596,0.9958471035045999,Positive
In terms of fullyear results in 2020 we generated gross revenue of 71.2 million which was up 13. OTC Link revenues was up 36 with a 239 increase in revenue from our OTC Link ECN as the primary driver. Our market data licensing business delivered 15 revenue growth yearoveryear for the reasons already discussed in the context of our quarterly results.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Corporate services revenue were up 2 with QX revenues up 1 while QB revenues saw a 4 decline yearoveryear. Strong growth in our indiscernible revenue of 160 and our DNS revenues of 7 offset the decline in QB revenues. During 2020 we hosted 27 virtual investor conferences with nearly 400 companies participating and reaching more than 21000 investors compared to a total of 18 events during 2019. During 2020 we added 106 new QX companies which was down from 123 in the prior year.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
New QB subscriptions however increased to 229 in 2020 versus 202 in the prior year primarily driven by the strong sales we saw in the fourth quarter. In September we announced that we will be raising annual fees for our QX market and also annual and semi annual fees for our OTCQB market affective January 1 2021. For the annual OTCQX subscription period which began on January 1 2021 we achieved a 94 retention rate which was up from the 92 in the prior year. For our OTCQB market we continue to see more than 90 of companies renewing at the end of their service terms.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Turning to expenses on a quarteroverquarter basis operating expenses increased by 5 the primary driver was a 62 increase in professional and consulting fees in part due to an increase in clearing and regulatory compliance fees which are related to the elevated volume of trading activity on our OTC Link ECN. Compensation and IT infrastructure costs also contributed to the increase partially offset by a decline in marketing and occupancy expenses.,OTCM,0.0915242731571197,-0.8169525366738658,Negative
The increase in compensation costs reflects the impact of higher headcount annual salary increases as well as an increase in cash and equity based incentive compensation related to our performance. On a yearoveryear basis operating expenses were up 5 driven by growth in compensation costs professional and consulting fees and depreciation and amortization offset by decline in marketing occupancy cost and general and administrative expenses.,OTCM,0.7781391143798828,0.5562779642808224,Positive
Compensation comprised about 66 of our total expense base in 2020. In summary we concluded 2020 as our 16th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. In the fourth quarter we delivered 42 quarteroverquarter growth in income from operations and 50 growth in net income. Our operating profit margin expanded to 35 compared to 30.5 in the prior year quarter.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For the full year income from operations increased 20 while operating profit margin expanded 170 basis points. Net income increased by 22. In addition to certain GAAP and other measures management utilizes a nonGAAP measure or adjusted EBITDA which excludes noncash stockbased compensation expenses. For the full year our adjusted EBITDA was 26.2 million or up 19.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Cash flows from operating activities for the full year amounted to 26 million a 21 increase while free cash flows for the year increased 57 reflecting a significant capital investment which we made during 2019 which did not recur during 2020. In the context of our investor focused capital allocation policy we return capital to investors in the form of dividends and to our stock buyback program. During 2020 we returned a total of 18.1 million which was up 14 over the prior year.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In closing during 2020 we remain focused on efficiently navigating the challenging economic and business conditions and serving our subscribers and the insurers that rely on our public markets. We were pleased to report strong revenue growth across all three of our businesses and robust earnings growth in both the fourth quarter and the year ending December 31 2020. We remain wellpositioned to continue to invest in our business and to prudently deploy capital. During 2021 we will continue to focus on generating profitable top line growth and delivering longterm value for our shareholders.,OTCM,0.9987757205963136,0.9975514397331715,Positive
With that Id like to turn it back to the operator thanking everyone for their time and opening the line for questions.,OTCM,0.9760127067565918,0.9520253849180846,Positive
QuestionandAnswer Session,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Operator Instructions Our first question comes from Chris McGinnis with Sidoti. Your line is open.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Good morning thanks for taking my questions. Nice quarter and Antonio congratulations on joining the team. I just wanted to start with OTC Link  we obviously really great in the quarter. We talked in the past about kind of you got a certain amount or a finite amount of growth to go after there,OTCM,0.9999998807907104,0.9999997615812788,Positive
I guess can you just talk about where youre at in terms of the market share the gains on market share where that can go from here And then also I think you announced also the NQB how does that change. Does that open up additional market share opportunities with Link you could just help me with that a little bit Thanks.,OTCM,0.0766712725162506,-0.8466585556617712,Negative
Sure thanks Chris. This is Dan and maybe Cromwell you want to answer the first part of that question.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes so Chris thank you for that question. I look at it is the impressive part volumes are something we dont fully control in the market. But whats been more impressive is the continuing subscriber the subscriber growth for OTC Link ECN. And that is something that the team did a fantastic job throughout 2020 and has continued to do that. And then you can take a look at a limited functionality for a certain type of trade.,OTCM,0.9999996423721312,0.9999992847438361,Positive
But going into the space of the anonymous matching engine model which is a tool to access liquidity and deliver best execution the brokerdealer desire is what the other tools for us to add on top of that. And this skill set in this space is and the ability to onboard new clients is a skill set that if we have a strong P and we can deliver. And this is really important technology to broker dealers at a competitive cost because both in the exchange phase and some other ATS in nonequity assets. The things are pretty expensive.,OTCM,0.9941800236701964,0.9883600404024362,Positive
So if were good at being a cost effective very useful client focused vendor well find opportunities. On NCB its  there is restrictions on how we can distribute our quote data if were anonymous ECN OTC Link. So its a third business model which is electronic match electronic Autolex of orders but fully disclosed. And that creates a data feed for us which makes our models better because were putting the data out further and wider the depth of book not just the inside.,OTCM,0.941077709197998,0.8821553481551099,Positive
And it creates some system reliability resilience. And it gives a third model for brokerdealers who want to be fully disclosed but dont want to put more liquidity on top of the execution. And what you really need to understand is different broker dealers have different needs based on their business model.,OTCM,0.952978491783142,0.9059569275122448,Positive
And we want to provide the tools and infrastructure across our platform to fit and make successful all different models of brokerage. And whether youre a dealer or an agency broker and be able to bring them together and connect them in an efficient and costeffective manner.,OTCM,0.9978089332580566,0.9956178639041566,Positive
I appreciate that thats very helpful. And I guess just turning to 15c211 and its like  to support initiatives youre going to have to invest a little bit. Is that correct in kind of reading what youve put in the annual report that  do you need to make a bigger investment this year to support changes around 15c211,OTCM,0.9854769706726074,0.9709539240324045,Positive
And then I guess just what are the opportunities are you excited about onboarding newer companies coming onto your markets or has this made you think about maybe investing in other areas of the business to maybe support growth if some of it hit. Can you just walk me through that a little bit,OTCM,0.9864642024040222,0.9729283886721067,Positive
Well 15c211 is the big transformation in 2021. And it takes us from offering a regulated trading platform business under Reg ATS. And having market data which investors and brokers use to analyze value and trade securities and our corporate services business which has been marketdriven. We built that whole business based on companies wanting to stepup and really own their trading to provide the information out there.,OTCM,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
So investors are informed and brokers can best most efficiently trade securities. However the markets move forward in 15c211 has recognized that we are the ones in the OTC market who set the standard for monitoring what level of disclosure and compliance and governance companies put out there. And this has been recognized has been continually recognized by the states as they recognized just for Blue Sky.,OTCM,0.9985750913619996,0.9971501810253747,Positive
So theres one part thats really important is we are moving to be seen as the entity that broker dealers can rely on for monitoring ongoing disclosure by issuers that theres current information as publicly available and ongoing and thats important. The second side is that it is because for the monitoring piece the ongoing disclosure were about halfway there. The market recognized it and then the regulators are catching up is that the onboarding is  exciting.,OTCM,0.999990940093994,0.9999818801771878,Positive
It is really painful and complicated to bring a company onto our markets because you had a broker dealer filing a 211 and with FINRA the FINRA information was hidden  in FINRA investors didnt see it. And its a change to what really should be done today is making sure that theres adequate current information publicly available when a security industry is trading. So its a big piece for us to one create the regulatory compliance infrastructure.,OTCM,0.0377223193645477,-0.9245565083959749,Negative
But on the other side is wheres the commercial value because today when a company would become trade at OTC. There wasnt a great ability for other broker dealers to see the information or understand the level of compliance the financial strength what  the securities issuance history all  these pieces of information that brokers need to trade a security and put it out into the market.,OTCM,0.971216917037964,0.9424337997637988,Positive
And so what we look at is 15c211 is providing the regulatory foundation for changing how companies can go public on our markets. But were going to build a commercial structure that gives value both to companies and broker dealers to make going public on our markets much more valuable and efficient.,OTCM,0.9950905442237854,0.9901810825950399,Positive
Thanks thank you for that thats helpful. And just one last thing Ill jump back in queue and open up for other people. But just on the MA opportunity to talk you know in the annual report you see 2021 as  maybe a bigger year. I think it is the last acquisition in 1980s and 1990s if I remember right around  the conference if I remember right,OTCM,0.9996048212051392,0.9992096419391883,Positive
So Chris I think this year is a year where you know we have  the markets have been doing fantastic and that said entities in our space that we could purchase are pricey. And so and we have a big internal project with 15c211. So we want to for the longterm and I think hiring of Antonia demonstrates where we want to go for the longer term. But in the shortterm we want to focus on our organic opportunities is and but we will.,OTCM,0.9580767154693604,0.9161533809622413,Positive
We are looking and if  and we will be opportunistic and strategic to if anything shows up that we think really can add value for shareholders over the longterm. And increase the  our per share earnings power which is as I think about it over the longterm we want to grow the pretax earnings or EBITDA of just the ability to earn per share. And both of the current amount but then the potential ongoing forward by having a strong platform that delivers value to our client base.,OTCM,0.9948171973228456,0.9896343884673051,Positive
And our next question comes from Andrew Mitchell with Edison. Your line is open.,OTCM,0.8121123313903809,0.6242244388010734,Positive
Thank you very much. And can I just followup again on a couple of those regulations like regulatory points. I was wondering if you have any indication of potential timing for approval of the expert market given the September compliance date,OTCM,0.9983336925506592,0.996667383114924,Positive
And then on the consolidated audit trail that I think next phase that becomes effective in April. And on both those fronts I mean can you give any sort of indication in terms of the cost side for the GCM for implementation yet,OTCM,0.9885921478271484,0.9771842820550691,Positive
Sure thanks Andrew. So Ill Ill start with experts. You may have seen the SEC put out a proposed conditional exemption towards the end of 2020 to the expert market with a comment period attached to it. We and several others commented on it and all of everything in the comment file very positive. That comment file closed about a month ago. And so we continue to talk to the SEC about it. We are anxious to see it get approved.,OTCM,0.9809747934341432,0.9619495641884592,Positive
But its  we understand as a commission is in flux a little bit right now with again theyre still going through the confirmation proceedings in order to potentially the SEC chair. And so wed love to see it happen any day now but do understand that there are other considerations within the commission. The best thing I can say is we have a really good open line of communication with the staff there.,OTCM,0.9873862266540528,0.9747724382713072,Positive
And so were constantly getting feedback and providing as much information as we can. And were hopeful that it gets approved sooner rather than later. But well certainly be the ones shouting from the mountaintops when it comes out so we wont be shy about it at all. With respect to CAT the next phase is to see if CAT becomes effective in April. But CAT has been around for a while and its only been talked about for a decade if not longer.,OTCM,0.9933887720108032,0.9867775361404039,Positive
And so the implementation that we focus on is really about supporting our subscribers and their ability to meet their CAT reporting requirements thats something we continue to do. Were meeting with and talking to our subscribers pretty regularly. So its not about sudden costs so much as the longerterm plan that weve had in place and the industry has had in place. And similarly its the same refrain there where we continue to talk to FINRA and the other SROs and the SEC about the ways to rightsize how CAT works for our market like ours.,OTCM,0.9953863620758056,0.9907727186517228,Positive
We know that we have a unique market model and that people havent necessarily considered it in developing things like CAT that started so many years ago. And so just working to make sure that they are considering all the unique aspect of our market structure is really the core and the key sort of initiative we have with respect to CAT.,OTCM,0.9985576272010804,0.9971152526827174,Positive
Okay great. Thanks very much. And then on the question on the elevated trading volumes youve referenced. I wonder if you are able to or there is an estimate of how important retail investors are within that. Obviously youve seen a big increase in terms of the market data size but just wondering on the trading size how much the high trading volume levels would you say are arising from the retail market,OTCM,0.9999918341636658,0.9999836683175971,Positive
So Andrew the way I look at trading volume is its something we dont control. We have a diverse group of securities. I mean people pay OTC with low price securities. A lot of the retail speculation has actually been on NYSE and NASDAQ Securities GameStop AMC Hertz. So and this isnt to say that we dont have those same forces going through. And the debate within the industry is really not is this a peak volume but has the floor gone up.,OTCM,0.8613498210906982,0.7226994768974047,Positive
And has there been more interest in stocks over time and will  and how will that stay and how will that transform that as investors get smarter. Investors that make mistakes will then be smarter and then theyll seek out other opportunities. Theyll do more research. Theyll learn like every investors coming to the market. The most successful investors Ive ever met have they talk about their history as early investors of not great making great investments and then using that to learn and get better.,OTCM,0.978674590587616,0.9573491557533478,Positive
So we look at it as  the volumes are fantastic. However and then however we want to last through both the good market cycles and the bad market cycles. And we built our business around it and we have transaction on subscription business. But our goal is to really keep improving the platform and keep increasing the capabilities for clients and fulfilling our mission to create more efficient and better informed financial markets.,OTCM,0.9929721355438232,0.9859442627097743,Positive
Okay  and following on from that neatly  is the point about the systems reliability and  thats one of your key points for the current year. But just wondering if that  does that involve higher CapEx than one might have expected prior to the exceptional volumes that have been going on or is that something which  youre still behaving as a more normal level of investment in the current year,OTCM,0.9997204542160034,0.9994409080987621,Positive
Well Andrew I mean were going to invest where we need to provide the quality of service that our clients demand of us. And weve got  it is with volumes coming through the business doing well  is a time  to invest is. That said were careful and thoughtful  about when we make our capital spending and when we make our add costs to the business. So its  we dont try to manage quartertoquarter or yeartoyear.,OTCM,0.9996273517608644,0.9992547030774972,Positive
I mean I think you saw that in 2019 we took our expenses up to invest in areas and in 2020 we were more careful and we really focused on having the team and the platform that we had you know is running the business. And so that cycle is were going to try and be very thoughtful to think about how do we have a platform and a company and a level of service that has the right amount of investment to come out of every year better than where it started.,OTCM,0.998137354850769,0.9962747074810907,Positive
And maybe to add to that...,OTCM,0.9367363452911376,0.873472615166077,Positive
Sorry go ahead.,OTCM,0.7975841164588928,0.595167991619105,Positive
Maybe to add briefly in general we expect our capital expenditures this year to be on par with 2020 and to elaborate on Cromwells point system reliability has been a focus of ours   core focus of ours for a long time. So we continued to invest at the levels that ensure achievement of high throughput and high reliability every year Andrew.,OTCM,0.8930100202560425,0.7860199129700143,Positive
Great thanks. And if I may just one final  question just on the MA point. Am I still right to think that your focus really is on incremental rather than again  realize your focus is more organic this year. But looking further out you could be looking for more incremental acquisitions rather than seeking a larger transformational acquisition,OTCM,0.99930739402771,0.9986147872297688,Positive
Well Andrew I mean I think in the lifecycle of our business is that we havent  weve been incremental weve been an organic growth story. And weve been very focused on improving the areas where our core capabilities are. And that said is we would like to acquire assets at attractive prices that are accretive per share for shareholders over the longterm.,OTCM,0.9824891686439514,0.9649783164133527,Positive
And we very much  Im a large shareholder. And I would like to over the years make the shares worth more throughout market cycles. So thats what we will always be looking at but we get to play a longer term game.,OTCM,0.9992897510528564,0.9985795012590297,Positive
Operator Instructions And at this time Im currently showing no further questions. Id like to turn the call back over to Mr. Cromwell Coulson for closing remarks.,OTCM,0.1635100245475769,-0.6729809480791975,Negative

First Kodak entered into financing agreements with Kennedy Lewis Investment Management. Kennedy Lewis has provided Kodak with an initial 225 million term loan and a commitment to provide delayed draw term loans of up to an additional 50 million which may be drawn on or before February 26 2023. The term loans mature in 5 years and bear interest comprised of 8.5 payable in cash quarterly and 4 PIK interest.

The convertible notes bear 5 PIK interest with a conversion price of 10 per share and have a mandatory conversion option by the company if the share price equals or exceeds 14.50 for 45 of 60 trading days.,KODK,0.7719054222106934,0.5438105725112989,Positive
Additionally Kennedy Lewis has purchased 1 million shares of the companys common stock at a purchase price of 10 per share. As part of the agreement Kennedy Lewis will have the right subject to certain conditions for 3 years or until they hold less than 50 of the initial principal amount of the term loans to nominate one person to be elected to the companys Board of Directors.,KODK,0.9841004014015198,0.9682007838492297,Positive
With the proceeds from these transactions Kodak repurchased 1 million shares of the companys 5.5 Series A convertible preferred stock due to mature on November 15 2021 from funds managed by Southeastern Asset Management for 100 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In addition Kodak has issued the Southeastern managed funds 1 million shares of Series B convertible preferred stock in exchange for the remaining Series A preferred stock for a total of 100 million. The Series B preferred stock has a 4 quarterly dividend payable in cash with a mandatory redemption in 5 years and 91 days. The conversion price is 10.50 per share with a mandatory conversion option by the company if the price equals or exceeds 14.50 for 45 of 60 trading days.,KODK,5.480647087097168e-05,-0.9998915790865297,Negative
Additionally Grand Oaks Capital an investment firm founded by a businessman and Paychex Founder Tom Golisano has committed to invest a total of 100 million in the company. The firm purchased 75 million of Kodaks 5 Series C convertible preferred stock and has agreed to purchase an additional 25 million of this series of preferred stock subject to HSR Act clearance. The Series C preferred stock has a 5 quarterly dividend payable in Series C preferred stock with a mandatory redemption in 5 years and 91 days. The conversion price is 10 per share with a mandatory conversion option by the company after a 2year period if the price equals or exceeds 20 per share for 45 of 60 trading days in year 3 or 15 per share in years 4 or 5.,KODK,0.1605833172798156,-0.6788343661036291,Negative
As part of the agreement Grand Oaks Capital will have the right subject to certain conditions for 3 years or until they hold less than 50 of the initial amount of the preferred shares or common stock into which it is converted to nominate one person to be elected to the companys Board of Directors.,KODK,0.9879156351089478,0.9758312558122013,Positive
Kodaks existing ABL facility is amended and extended using the same lending group with prorated reduction of commitments. The amendment extends the term to 3 years and reduces the commitment from 110 million to 90 million. Additionally a new 50 million letter of credit facility was entered into with a subset of the ABL facility group. This agreement also contains a 3year term.,KODK,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
These transactions together provide the company with approximately 210 million of incremental cash after fees expenses and incremental ABL funding to invest in growth opportunities in Kodaks core businesses of print advanced materials and chemicals. An additional 25 million will be funded no later than 45 days from the closing of the other transactions subject only to HartScottRodino Act approval and 50 million of delayed draw on the term loan will remain available for up to 24 months. Furthermore the transactions address the mandatory redemption of the Series A preferred stock that was required in November of 2021 extend the maturity date of the companys ABL and limit the amount of cash needed to service capital.,KODK,0.7982581853866577,0.5965161302781881,Positive
Prior to the financing transactions which closed on February 26 2021 in accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting rules there was substantial doubt about the companys ability to operate as a going concern due to the recent history of negative operating cash flow maturity of the ABL credit agreement in 2021 redemption date in November of 2021 for the Series A convertible preferred stock and increased challenges in managing cash during the COVID19 pandemic. The additional liquidity provided by the financing the extension of the maturity date of the ABL credit agreement and the repurchase and exchange of the Series A convertible preferred stock eliminates the substantial doubt about Kodaks ability to continue as a going concern.,KODK,0.0008653104305267,-0.9982705702010216,Negative
As previously mentioned in the third quarter the company discovered efficiencies and controls required to safeguard its assets. The company determined that controls were inadequate with regard to the timely input and verification of master data updates for equity grants and therefore resulted in the detection of errors or misstatements in employee equity account balances. This control weakness did not result in the misstatement of any current or prior period financial statements. The company has remediated these control deficiencies as of December 31 2020. Documentation and supervisory review controls around master data were strengthened and an audit trail of stockbased compensation award additions and modifications performed by the service provider is now being maintained. A complete reconciliation of the repository of equity grants is being performed and controls have been strengthened by employing an independent reconciliation process and ensuring appropriate segregation of duties.,KODK,0.0009015798568725,-0.9981980313050934,Negative
I will now share further details on the full company results operational EBITDA and cash flow for 2020. On Slide 6 as we reported in our earnings release for 2020 we reported revenues of 1.029 billion compared to 1.242 billion in the prior year for a decline of 213 million. Adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 9 million and license revenue received in the prior year from the HuaGuang transaction of 13 million revenue declined by 209 million compared to the prior year.,KODK,0.1302071809768676,-0.7395866749207229,Negative
On a U.S. GAAP basis we reported net loss for 2020 of 541 million compared to net income of 116 million in 2019. The 2020 results include expense of 382 million related to changes in value for the derivative embedded in the Series A preferred stock and convertible notes 2 million related to the loss on extinguishment of debt 4 million related to noncash changes in workers compensation and postemployment reserves 10 million related to a net gain on the sale of assets 3 million related to a trade name impairment 3 million related to an increase in accounts receivable reserves and 167 million noncash expense as a result of the increase in deferred tax valuation allowances outside the U.S.,KODK,0.1384581327438354,-0.7230847615508805,Negative
The 2019 results include a net gain on asset sales due primarily to the sale of the FPD business of 201 million noncash changes in workers compensation adjustments of 3 million expense of 4 million related to trade name impairments and the related changes in the fair value for the derivatives embedded in the Series A preferred stock and convertible notes of 42 million.

Operational EBITDA for 2020 was negative 1 million compared to 13 million in 2019. Excluding the current year impact of the increase in accounts receivable reserves the license revenue received from the HuaGuang transaction in 2019 and adjusting for the increase in workers compensation and postemployment reserves operational EBITDA increased by 3 million from the prior year. Operational EBITDA for 2020 was unfavorably impacted by higher manufacturing costs driven by unfavorable cost absorption due to volume declines of 29 million partially offset by cost savings including furloughs and pay reductions. Foreign exchange did not have an impact on operational EBITDA.,KODK,6.079673767089844e-05,-0.9998795985457889,Negative
On a full year basis volumes for SONORA ProcessFree Plates declined by 6 and the annuity revenue for PROSPER declined by 7 which was attributable to the market downturn related to the COVID19 pandemic. At the height of the impact of COVID19 in 2020 which was our second quarter volumes for SONORA ProcessFree Plates decreased by 33 and PROSPER annuity revenue decreased by 25.,KODK,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The company began to recognize some recovery of volumes during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and the beginning of 2021. We expect to continue to place our solutions with new and existing customers in these areas. We also continue to invest in future growth areas of ULTRASTREAM and advanced materials.,KODK,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Moving on to the company cash performance presented on Slide 7. Cash cash equivalents and restricted cash for 2020 decreased by 34 million compared to an increase of 23 million in the prior year. Restricted cash and cash included in assets held for sale increased by 3 million as compared to an increase of 23 million in the prior year. The prior year includes 14 million for the establishment of an escrow in China to secure various ongoing obligations under the agreements for the strategic relationship with HuaGuang and 19 million in funding related to the ABL primarily due to the sale of FPD.,KODK,0.0263462364673614,-0.9473086877517032,Negative
Included in the 2020 balance sheet changes is a 14 million historical obligation to Kodak Alaris that was eliminated by offsetting 11 million of accounts receivable and the recognition of a 3 million deferred gain. Additionally in 2020 the company declared and paid 4 quarterly dividends on its Series A convertible preferred stock that were in arrears for a total of 11 million. In the fourth quarter of 2020 the company also increased restricted cash by 12 million primarily in anticipation of a letter of credit facility that I described earlier. We continue to evaluate opportunities to eliminate restricted cash in 2021 and to benefit from our cash positions around the world.,KODK,9.02712345123291e-05,-0.9998206495169696,Negative
During 2020 cash used in operating activities was 35 million driven primarily by cash used from net earnings of 25 million and cash used in balance sheet changes of 10 million including a change in working capital of 9 million and a decrease in other liabilities of 26 million. Accounts payable decreased by 36 million inventory decreased by 12 million and accounts receivable decreased by 33 million.

The prior year included proceeds from the sale of the FPD and the HuaGuang transactions. Cash provided by financing activities was 10 million for 2020 compared to a use of 298 million in the prior year. The prior year included 395 million of cash used for the full repayment of the senior secured first lien term credit agreement partially offset by the issuance of the secured convertible notes of 100 million.,KODK,0.2399339377880096,-0.5201330304938738,Negative
The company generated positive cash flow in the second half of 2020 which reflects benefits from working capital improvements and cost savings including furloughs and pay reductions which occurred during the year. The company will remain focused on cash generation in 2021. Finally we remain in compliance with all applicable financial covenants.,KODK,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
In summary the company has managed through 2020 despite the challenges presented by the COVID19 pandemic increasing its cash balances in both the third and fourth quarters of the year. We have further strengthened our balance sheet by removing legacy liabilities. The financing transactions announced in March 2021 provided the company with incremental liquidity to pursue growth. We are excited to focus on growth opportunities in 2021.,KODK,0.0580661296844482,-0.8838688635044477,Negative
I will now turn the discussion back to Jim.,KODK,0.8522487878799438,0.7044973996266124,Positive

Yes Jim. Earlier this evening Kodak filed 2 shelf registration statements following the filing of the 2020 Form 10K. These replaced 2 existing shelf registrations that have been withdrawn. Under one of the new registration statements the company will have the flexibility to issue and sell up to 500 million of securities which is approximately 350 million less than the previous registration statement. The second new registration statement registers the resale of common stock issuable under the new convertible securities issued on February 26 as well as the outstanding common stock previously registered and the 1 million shares of common stock issued on February 26. The shelf registration statement relating to the Series A preferred stock and the common stock issuable upon its conversion has been withdrawn as the Series A preferred stock has been retired. The new registration statements will not become effective until any necessary SEC review has been completed.,KODK,0.94389009475708,0.8877801226259006,Positive

Great. Thank you Carolina. Good morning or good afternoon and welcome to Canacols fourth quarter 2020 conference call. 2020 the corporation achieved several important goals with respect to growing its gas base in Colombia including a 20 increase in realized natural gas sales yearoveryear a 16 return on capital employed strong and stable operating margins at an average of 79 a 2 increase in 2P reserves yearoveryear related to continued exploration and development success representing a 122 2P reserve replacement ratio.,CNNEF,0.9999284148216248,0.9998568295579133,Positive
We were also awarded two new conventional gas exploration blocks in the 2020 exploration bid round. All of this was achieved despite the global COVID19 pandemic impacting demand for gas in Colombia and our ability to operate in the field when countrywide or local pandemic related restrictions were in place.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Our success was possible thanks to the hard work of our teams that have strong processes in place to deal with the pandemic and the strong longterm fundamentals of the Colombian gas market which had allowed us to contract the majority of our production capacity under fixed price takeorpay gas sales contracts.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Realized natural gas sales during Q4 were 170 million standard cubic feet per day a 6 decrease from the same period in 2019 but a 4 increase from the third quarter of 2020. Realized gas sales have continued to recover from a low point of 136 million standard cubic feet per day in April of 2020 to 182 million standard cubic feet per day on average in January and February of 2021 with an average of 172 million cubic feet per day for the year 2020 which is 20 higher than average gas sales for 2019.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Drilling operations were halted in late March by COVID which was the main reason why despite restarting drilling operations with 2 weeks in July only six wells were drilled and completed compared to the 12 we had originally planned. All six wells drilled in 2020 of which two were exploration wells and one was an appraisal well successfully encountered gas contributing to the continued growth in these areas were able to report at yearend.,CNNEF,0.7716423273086548,0.543284382393588,Positive
We achieved 122 2P reserve replacement ratio and a 2 increase in our 2P gas reserve base to 637 billion cubic feet approximately 10year reserve life index under current production. Our gas exploration drilling results over the past 7 years have yielded an industry leading 83 hit rate for commercial discoveries.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
The net present value of future net revenue from reserve discounted at 10 is now estimated at 1.3 billion on an after tax basis and 1.7 billion on a pretax basis respectively which equates to a CAD11.97 per share of reserve value and a CAD9.55 per share of 2P net asset value as of the end of December 2020 respectively.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
2P finding on development costs aiming at our industry leading 1.33 per Mcf and 0.84 per Mcf for the 1 and 3year periods ending December 31 2020 respectively. And we achieved a 2.7x and a 4.4x 2P recycle ratio for the 1 and 3year periods ending in December 31 2020 respectively.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
We also continue to deliver on a return of capital to shareholders in 2020 via our quarterly dividend program with no cut into the impact of COVID19 and by buying back shares under our previously announced normal course issuer bid.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Ill now turn the presentation over to Jason Bednar our CFO who will discuss our fourth quarter financials in more detail. When he is done I will provide detail on the outlook for 2021.,CNNEF,0.972722053527832,0.9454440745377986,Positive
Thanks Charle. Although the global pandemic made it a uniquely challenging year 2020 was nonetheless a great year financially for Canacol and its stakeholders as we continue to execute our plan to develop our growing natural gas business. Largely driven by having a full year with higher gas transportation capacity following the completion of the pipeline expansion in August of 2019 we reported approximately 145 million in funds from operations for the full year of 2020 a 16 increase from 2019 despite sales volumes being negatively impacted by temporary COVID related reduction in demand. It impacted funds from operations for the second quarter of 2020 in particular.,CNNEF,0.1505857110023498,-0.6988295905766433,Negative
Cash capital expenditures decreased 6 as we were forced by COVID related restrictions to defer some of our planned spending and as we focused on the most value enhancing activities within our core gas operations. Increased funds from operations combined with lower CapEx allowed us to achieve four positive results.,CNNEF,0.1760879158973693,-0.6478251503855887,Negative
First off we generated approximately 60 million in free cash flow before interest. Secondly we maintained our quarterly dividend declaring approximately 28 million to shareholders. Third we applied approximately 6 million to the repurchase of shares and lastly we increased our holdings of cash and cash equivalents by approximately 27 million.,CNNEF,0.9678808450698853,0.9357616518507312,Positive
Our dividend currently represents an annual yield of approximately 5.7 with the last quarterly dividend paid in January and the next one due to be paid on April 15 2021. Our year end net debt position of approximately 342 million was effectively unchanged from a yearago. As we announced in August we were able to reprofile our credit facilities during 2020 to substantially lower our cost of debt  our cost of debt capital. Thanks to lower interest rates.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
While increasing the financial flexibility we have to invest in strategic growth projects including the Medellin pipeline and El Tesorito power plant projects. Our net debt to EBITDAX ratio is reduced from 2.1x at December 31 2019 to 1.85x at December 31 2020 well inside covenant limits. We continue to plan to pay down our debt in due course rather than building up large cash balances but well do so strategically to minimize our finance expenses while we maintain our financial flexibility and our ability to continue investing in our business and buying back shares when it makes sense to do so.,CNNEF,0.0668374896049499,-0.8663261332071622,Negative
Focusing on the fourth quarter of 2020. Financial highlights include revenues net of transportation royalties decreased 6 to 62 million compared to 66 million for the same period in 2019 mainly due to a 6 decline in sales volumes which was due to reduce gas demand resulting from the gas market still not being fully recovered from COVID related weakness in Q4.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Adjusted funds flow from operations increased 7 to 35 million from 33 million in 2019 as lower revenues were more than offset by lower GA expenses and cash taxes. EBITDAX increased 6 to 46 million from 43 million. Our cash position increased 66 to 68 million from 41 million and net income decreased 96 to 1 million from 25 million. That yearoveryear decline in net income is largely attributable to a deferred tax expense of 12 million in Q4 2020 compared to a deferred tax gain of 16 million in the comparable quarter in 2019.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Focusing solely on 2020 we see a simple trend we view as more important when we look at revenues funds from operations and EBITDAX all steadily recovering from the lows seen in Q2 2020 at the height of the COVID first wave in Colombia. As Charle already highlighted in his opening statement we have reported that monthly sales volumes continued to recover in January and February so were optimistic that this trend will continue throughout 2021.,CNNEF,0.9931091070175172,0.986218205820445,Positive
Our operating netback was unchanged at 3.58 per Mcf in the 3 months ended December 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 while our operating margin declined only very slightly from 78 to 77. These results again highlight the stability and high margin nature of our gas business.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
What wasnt shown in the preceding operating netback and margin slide is the success weve achieved in lowering our corporate costs including GA finance and other expenses particularly when measured in proportion to our sales volumes in revenue. GA for the first 12  for the 12 months ended December 31 2020 average just 0.42 per Mcf 23 lower than the 0.55 per Mcf for the prior year.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
To further highlight the strength and stability as well as growth that we see in our business and financial results we want to highlight the return on capital employed  implied by our financial statements over the last eight quarters. The COVID pandemic curtailed the positive trajectory our return on capital employed was showing a year ago but our return on capital employed remains very high by EP standards at 16 on average for the full year 2020 up from 15 in 2019. And quarterly results are now demonstrating a clearly positive trend that we are optimistic will continue as we move forward.,CNNEF,0.9925357103347778,0.9850714117714237,Positive
In closing our Q4 financial results were strong and relatively stable despite the challenges that the coronavirus pandemic presented. And we are now in an increasingly enviable position of financial strength with an ability to easily maintain a steady return to shareholders and increased flexibility to ramp up investment levels when we think it makes sense to do so. And if operational restrictions dont prevent us from doing so.,CNNEF,0.9036520719528198,0.8073040290498907,Positive
At this point Ill hand it back to Charle. Thank you everyone.,CNNEF,0.7585989236831665,0.5171975595936535,Positive
Thanks Jason. Our results for the fourth quarter of 2020 showed positive impact to our investments in growth and return to a slightly more normal operating environment in gas market. Our results for the full year demonstrate the longterm stability provided by our business model including our fixed takeorpay gas sales contracts.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
For 2021 despite the impact of COVID19 lingering in the shortterm we are optimistic we will continue to see demand and related sales volumes and pricing gradually strengthened allowing us to report continued growth in sales volumes revenues and funds from operations.,CNNEF,0.7940085530281067,0.5880168604951266,Positive
We therefore expect to remain wellpositioned to continue returning capital to shareholders while reducing our leverage ratios and investing for growth. Although the pandemic is not over we are progressing our drilling program with two rigs currently drilling at the Milano 1 exploration well in the Caahuate 4 development well. And a total of 12 wells planned for the year with 9 of those wells being exploration wells are drilling and seismic programs for this year has a significant focus on exploration to support longterm production growth.,CNNEF,0.8861821889877319,0.7723642422939792,Positive
In addition to investing in drilling and seismic to allow us to grow production reserves over the longterm we are working diligently to progress important strategic process  projects that will support increased transportation capacity and demand for our gas such as Medellin pipeline and the El Tesorito power plant project.,CNNEF,0.996263027191162,0.9925260499275026,Positive
And of course in order to build a sustainable business we will seek further continuous improvement in our strategy and execution as it relates to all ESG matters. Given currently prevailing optimism around COVID19 incident rates hospitalizations and vaccines as well as the positive dynamics we see taking place in Colombias gas market is probably worth reminding you that we could yet look at investing beyond our base budget program as indicated in our guidance press release in December.,CNNEF,0.9998893737792968,0.9997787474267168,Positive
Conversely if gas demand were again impacted by a third or fourth wave of COVID related restrictions we maintain flexibility in our capital program to adjust accordingly. Id like to thank the entire Canacol team as well as our contractors partners and clients for their support and hard work during this challenging year that 2020 was and with somewhat uncertain times that continue as we seek to return to more normal operating conditions.,CNNEF,0.1003300547599792,-0.7993409629708309,Negative

Thank you. We have a first question from Alejandro Demichelis from Nau Securities. Alejandro is asking could you please comment how you see the situation with the fracking pilot,CNNEF,0.9989200830459596,0.9978401648045572,Positive
Yes. As you know Ecopetrol is preparing to execute a fracking pilot a nonconventional pilot for oil in the middle of Magdalena Valley. And ExxonMobil recently announced that theyre applying for a permit to execute a similar pilot also in the middle Magdalena Valley. So the regulatory environment at the moment is favorable for these fracking pilots. By no means does that ensure that they will be able to execute them without difficulty especially from the communities who remain heavily opposed to fracking from an environmental perspective.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
These pilots are noncommercial pilots or they are not intended to establish commercial production. As a matter of fact these pilots do not have any commercial terms associated with them. Theyre simply designed to apply typical massive hydraulic fracturing techniques here in Colombia and monitor the impact of those operations on the environment specifically groundwater micro tremors etcetera. So really these pilots are designed not for commercial test basis but really to prove or to collect information with respect to the potential environmental impacts of indiscernible technology in the study areas.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Thank you Charle. Operator I believe we have someone in the queue who wants to ask some question.,CNNEF,0.9695283770561218,0.9390567177872167,Positive
Yes. The next question will be from Josef from  Josef Schachter  excuse me if I got that wrong. Go ahead Josef.,CNNEF,0.8254395723342896,0.6508789365762093,Positive
And thanks for taking the call. Two modeling questions. El Tesorito you mentioned in your early remarks that volumes are picking up in January February. Can you talk about the COVID issue and how El Tesorito is moving forward And should we be modeling in anything for volumes in Q1 of 22 Or should we drag out a little bit further like when do you expect the potential 30 million a day to come on given the current status of construction with COVID rules,CNNEF,0.9997516870498656,0.9995033738037189,Positive
Hey Josef. Yes El Tesorito is on schedule basically. I mean its the civil works has started there and the licenses are all in order. The motors have all been commissioned and in the process of fabrication in Europe. The start date is estimated between December and February. December of this year and February of next year. So that seems to be moving ahead smoothly. With respect to potential sales volumes there remains a deficit still in the electrical market related to the delay of Ituango hydroelectric project. So theres a 2500 megawatt deficit in the hydro space. So the forecast is that our cash repo will be generated between 50 and 75 capacity would translate between 20 million to 30 million cubic feet per day of sales when it starts up.,CNNEF,0.9084068536758424,0.8168135981640807,Positive
The model 20 million to 30 million in  from Q2 of 21 would be,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Correct. Yes. So  correct.,CNNEF,0.998183012008667,0.9963660218513142,Positive
Second you still have the oil production on with high 60s for Brent. I would have thought somebody would have wanted to come by and buy them by now. Is there a sales process still underway And do you see that potentially coming off the books in 21,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
Yes the Rancho Hermoso asset that you refer to were netting 200 or 300 barrels a day. The net backs are actually very good. I think their net backs are almost 40 a barrel given that the OpEx is reasonable there. But thats a very complicated contract. Its an Ecopetrol contract. And as usual not an easy contract to manage particularly with respect to sign the contract. So its the very first contract we ever picked up in Colombia in 2008. And it seems like its going to be with us for quite a while Josef.,CNNEF,0.9154423475265504,0.8308845942524639,Positive
Yes. Do you see given the netbacks as you said are pretty lucrative. Do you see potentially looking at opportunities on the lighter barrel side of oil and building a business over there as well,CNNEF,0.9996677041053772,0.9993354078146266,Positive
No. No were 100 focused on gas so we will not invest. We will simply invest a minimum work program type of investment in the Rancho Hermoso field which is related more to maintenance and occasional workovers. But we do not foresee drilling of any new wells for example regardless of what the price environment for oil is which is of absolutely no interest whatsoever to us.,CNNEF,0.9352570176124572,0.870513958045219,Positive
Okay super. Thanks so much. Much appreciated.,CNNEF,0.9998523592948914,0.9997047184137813,Positive
Thank you Josef.,CNNEF,0.9314355850219728,0.8628710883087449,Positive

We have a question from Mark VanderBeek ph. Mark is asking what are your plans for the announced share buyback program Can you provide any color on your plans to buy back shares in 2021,CNNEF,0.9508765935897828,0.901753128619867,Positive
Yes. I mean as you know we bought back 2 million shares in 2020 for approximately US6 million. Under our bond covenant limits we can buy back 15 million a year but we are allowed to carry forward from prior years if we dont spend all that. I cant  at this point in time I cant give you any clear goals or targets. Obviously were cognizant of share price fluctuations when it may be more opportune as to less. I will say that some of you probably on the line probably received questionnaires that Canacol sent out. Were actively soliciting shareholders thoughts with respect to what they viewed as more valuable increased dividends or increased share buybacks or increased debt repayments. So we just got those back and were starting to have a look at those and therell be some more discussions on that topic. But at this stage I cant give you any defined limits.,CNNEF,0.9999980926513672,0.9999961853004606,Positive
Thanks Jason. Now we have a question from Till Moss ph from Schroders. Till ph is asking can you elaborate on your debt pay down strategy please,CNNEF,0.999767005443573,0.9995340106093946,Positive
Sure. So just to refresh everyones memory we of course have the bond that was issued in May of 2018 which is 320 million. Thats a  that is typical no call options and wed be paying penalty  penalties. We paid that down earlier for another year or two on that. But just in the normal course of business some of our other loans we will be paying down 7 million in 2021 17 million of structured debt repayment in 2022 and 8.6 million in 2023.,CNNEF,0.0017524659633636,-0.9964962580777754,Negative
Thanks Jason. We have a question now from Sofia Rojas from BD Capital. Shes asking has it been decided who will be the EPC contractor for the Mediline pipeline project Is there any update regarding this project,CNNEF,0.9916632175445556,0.983326425150886,Positive
With respect to the project in Mediline we continue to wait for the execution of the main sales after contract with the public utility company there. We have received all of the final offers from the EPC contractors of which there are three. And we have essentially completed the financial structuring of the project with respect to debt and equity. But again we wait. The main component that were waiting for would be the execution of the off the main off take contract to the main consumer Mediline.,CNNEF,0.912073254585266,0.8241464043536211,Positive
Thanks Charle. The next question is from Rodrigo Torres from indiscernible. He is asking if you can remind him about our investment plan for 2021 and its comparison with 2020 plan.,CNNEF,0.5,-5.960468030252741e-07,Negative
I think Jason can take that.,CNNEF,0.7367562055587769,0.4735120973063096,Positive
Yes. By investment plan I assume were talking about capital expenditures. So we put out a press release in January which has all the details but the high case I believe was 140 million and included 12 wells with 9 of those being exploration wells I believe. And this last year we  in 2020 the CapEx number was 85 million. So were certainly planning on increased investment and increased well count in 2021.,CNNEF,0.9969684481620787,0.9939368927102639,Positive
Thanks Jason. The next one is we have another question from indiscernible from Schroders. He is asking should we expect any impact of the tax bill on yourself directly or impacting Colombian purchasing power,CNNEF,0.9512407779693604,0.9024814978131639,Positive
Yes thats a very good question. This relates directly to a deferred tax writedown we did in Q4. So in late 2020 a Council of State Court ruling essentially disallowed the use of losses on merge companies. So the particular case that was in front of the court at that point in time was not an oil and gas case. And it had different facts circumstances than the Canacol case. Its probably important to note that the DN ph has yet to change the tax laws to reflect that particular courts ruling. So as you can imagine that has affected many companies and many challenges to that ruling are expected in the near future with Canacol being one of those challenges. So many experts believe the ruling is unconstitutional. And it was due to the ambiguity surrounding that ruling that we do recognize the deferred tax assets on our balance sheets.,CNNEF,0.0804828405380249,-0.8390354150744767,Negative
Having said that if  should Canacol or any other company proved successful in any challenge which we believe some will be heard within the first 12 months we would be able to use those 29 million of losses in the year where we are successful or someone else is successful. I should note that it was that particular court only disallowed certain tax losses in that particular case. So were hopeful that we will get that back and obviously were working with local experts via constitution or tax wise on that particular topic. But we ended with 60  at the end of the year with 68 million in cash. Weve got a 46 million revolving line of credit that is untouched and our budgets would not be looking to touch that. So it was unfortunate but it has no impact on our plans at this stage.,CNNEF,0.985115647315979,0.9702312768884163,Positive
We have one last question from James Branch ph. James is asking your production by field show some interesting shapes. Nelson and Palmer are declining and being replaced by Clarinete and Pandereta. Are there exploration targets in 2021 of a size of Clarinete,CNNEF,0.96295428276062,0.9259085213592773,Positive
Yes thank you James. Yes as we continue to add more fields to our production mix we tend to back off production and some of the other fields to lower the production in order to capture as much reserves as we can as we sort of lower the production from the big producing fields and as we bring on new fields. But in general weve been shifting our exploration away from Esperanza which are where Nelson and Palmer are located and where we did our first exploration 5 6 years ago. Weve been shifting more and more exploration activity into VIM5 which is where Clarinete and Pandereta are located. So yes the new discoveries were making  the big new discoveries were making tend to be located in Clarinete and the VIM5 area. This year with 12 wells 9 exploration wells being drilled are those 12 this is our biggest exploration year ever for gas. The 9 exploration wells are targeting over 300 Bcf of unrisked prospective gas resource that we have identified. And yes we do see some targets that are in the range of  in between Clarinete and Pandereta size 100 plus Bcf targets.,CNNEF,0.9310571551322936,0.8621142280782625,Positive
